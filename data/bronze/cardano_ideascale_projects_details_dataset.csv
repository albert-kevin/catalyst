A high level, declarative, transaction editor that fully integrates with your wallet, cardano-node and your text editor.",14,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 13:01",Oscar,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Oscar/3102803-48088,,,16400,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


A command line is the first user interface everybody creates. It is a straightforward text interface that has access to all functions. It is a great starting point to get things done. You can extend it with shell scripts, to help you with common functionality. At that point, despite the increased programmability, you lose flexibility. Programs are sequences of instructions and you must follow the order. The bigger your tasks get the more cumbersome it becomes to use the command line or shell scripts.
You need to rethink the user interface. You move away from the command line and serial instructions into a declarative interface. Start using templates instead of memorizing commands and options. Finally drop the concept of ""sequencing instructions"".
I want a tool like that. A powerful tool to interact with the cardano-node, which has all the features, does not get cumbersome as you increase the complexity of your tasks, and empowers you as a user.
I couldn't find such a tool, thus I started building it myself. A text editable interface as a wallet for Cardano to create my transactions. A tool that embraces the power of my text editor instead of the limitations of the command line.
Have look at the current prototype

Implementation is on Emacs because, at the moment, it has the richest ecosystem to develop text-editor-based interfaces.
Finally, you don't need to know Emacs to use it. You only need to learn to use the wallet interface. The same way people have learned to use ""magit"", as a better git interface, without learning to use Emacs. Although, I would argue, learning Emacs is a good thing.
Impact
User interfaces define the usability of a product. It is not enough to provide a tool that does the job, it must enable the user to do the job. The user and the job to be done define the requirements of the user interface. There is never a UX that fits everybody.
The proposed interface is for developers, stake pool operators, and people that need low-level access to the cardano-node. A declarative interface lets you focus on the transaction its context, and not on the tool & the instructions themselves. Thus you skip learning the CLI tool, and only worry about understanding the transactions you work on. The tool provides you with context & templates.
This tool is not about making an ""easier"", ""one-click solution"", ""beautiful reactive"" web interface with colors and buttons for the masses. This tool is for professionals, people that do daily work not one-off tasks. The text interface, embedded in a text editor, provides high flexibility, fine control and straightforward composability.
How many times do you edit your command line instructions in your editor to copy them later to the terminal? And you are still forced to consider linebreak marks and escaping or quoting. You remain constrained by the behavior and one-dimensionality of the command line, even when working from the editor.
Better tools open more possibilities.
Feasibility
Emacs as a text editor has highly developed APIs. Emacs has a very powerful programming language(despite unpopular), to edit text, interact with foreign processes, use foreign modules and do web requests.
I already started prototyping this tool, this proposal is already the second prototype. I first started providing dialogs to select wallets, UTxOs, addresses. I was emulating what many on the internet do with their bash scripts. It was still very cumbersome, it was pipelined, it only works in one way. A task has a flow of actions, and like many bash scripts, I find doing a mistake requires canceling and starting all over again.
The insight came when working on the continuous integration configuration. You declare things, you move a level higher, from actions to tasks. You can always review, change your mind, and edit. Because there are no actions or instructions, there is no intermediate state, there are only end goals. What the transaction should look like is what the interface must look like.
The prototype works and I like the workflow it provides. Wrapping a command-line interface is a common task to do in Emacs. The cardano-cli is a moving target and care needs to be taken to still create a flexible wrapper that supports updates on the CLI tool.
Wrapping the commands to use Plutus scripts is also simple. Yet, I still iterate on the design of that interface. A database of Data and Datumhashes. A store of contracts. A translator of the Haskell isData type into the JSON values or typed JSON files is still on the design works.
Wrapping the cardano-cli is simple because it is a stand-alone binary to execute. Integrating with cardano-wallet is more challenging, as it is a service that must be running and requires a configuration of its own. I will work on that during the implementation of this project. Not all problems are solved at the outset of this proposal, which would already imply a finished product.
Auditability
The rate of work is a part-time occupation. Weekly sprints of 3 workdays(Fri, Sat, Sun) (I do work part-time in my main occupation). This spaced work is very beneficial, as it gives time for the community of users to test the tool and deliver feedback. It also helps me as a developer to gather ideas over the week, while thinking about other tasks. This influences thought, rest, and openness.
Every week, the sprint starts on Fridays with community feedback review and planning of tasks. The development follows until the end of Saturday. Sunday is reviews and reports day. Completed features are documented in a newsletter form and posted on the Cardano forum. These features are documented as part of the Handbook of the tool. A demo video is recorded, edited, and posted online(on YouTube). Yes, a full day of work is dedicated to communication. New Features are important, but getting them into the hands of users is what counts. People, even technical ones, read more tutorials and documentation than the actual source code.
Auditability is not measured on the public commits to the repo, but in people using the tool. Replying to posts to the forum, engaging. Community participation keeps accountability high too.
Timeline and Budget
Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face -- Mike Tyson.
560 USD Cloud Infrastructure 12 months. Includes Continuous Integration & build servers. VPS to run cardano-nodes on mainnet, public testnet, and some private testnet clusters for testing. This infrastructure budget, extends duration of project to allow the growth test of the tool.
I propose an 11 Week action plan, based on my current prototyping rate. I already invested 3 weekends crafting the transaction editor for multi-input/multi-output transactions and extended the capabilities to work with Plutus contracts.
Most software development is unpredictable and has little to do with the task at hand. It always requires investigating and solving problems related to dependencies. It all takes time.
This 11-week plan at a work rate of 3 days of work, and a developer compensation average of 60USD/hour. It includes technical documentation writing, forum post updates, and video editing.

Weekend-01: (Head start) Release of current TX editor. Enough capabilities to solve Exercises 3 & 4 of Alonzo Testnet. Packaging of binary dependencies like libyaml
Weekend-02: Functionality for Mary-era token minting
Weekend-03: Functionality for Plutus minting scripts.
Weekend-04: Design and prototype, Data and Plutus-scripts management tool. Cache files? Directories? SQLite database?
Weekend-05: Review and release Data and Plutus-scripts management tool.
Weekend-06: Design a UTxOs query tool. Some Plutus contracts need to track state via an NFT. A tool to inspect UTxOs and find specific ones becomes relevant, beyond the coin selection algorithm.
Weekend-07: Design and Review wallet balances view. Tree view for UTxOs becomes cumbersome with many UTxOs and Multiasset. Test constrained tabular views and filtering.
Weekend-08: Release UTxOs query tool and balances view features.
Weekend-09: Start wrapping cardano-wallet cli. + Deal with setup problems
Weekend-10: Release cardano-wallet functionalities to use ""Hierarchical Deterministic"" Wallets
Weekend-11: Wrap up, clean up, deal with outstanding bugs, make a stable release. Main product launch

 Measurable goals:

Each Alonzo-testnet exercises has a solution tutorial using this tool.
Alpha & beta releases on weekends: 1, 3, 5, 8
Stable release on weekend 11

Vision of success:

3 months: Tool is usable for all Alonzo-testnet exercises 
6 months: This tool is the preferred way of interacting with the cardano node.
12 months: There is an active community and community funding to foster the development of this tool.

Outlook for future work in later Catalyst Funds

Develop, with emacs modules, a Haskell foreign function interface to directly connect to the cardano-cli or node bypassing any interaction with the terminal.
Develop a graphql interface and become a blockchain explorer.

Welcome! Thank you for visiting this proposal,
The objective is to get more developers building the ecosystem on Cardano, OK! Let's make it easy for them.
Language barriers
One barrier to entry for Ethereum based developers is learning the Haskel Language, the answer would be to give the main code blocks for popular applications fully ready. This would allow the developers get a basic application up and running on the blockchain quickly.
Then instructions could be given showing how to customise the user experience, look and feel.
If additional functionality is required, they could hire a Haskel/plutus developer to finish the work, which would be more efficient in time and finances.
Basic Code Templates
As there are only so many application models it should also be possible to give complete basic templates for example stand-alone wallet, browser wallet DEX, NFT platform, retail point of sale, online checkout payments, smart contracts (with different features), stable coin etc.
Customisable platform
Another approach would be to create a foundation framework, like an open source content management system for websites, where modules could be uploaded to increase and add certain functionality.
Developer Contracting Platform
The other way to build the number of applications operating on the Cardano blockchain is to create an easy way for people to contract with trained developers in the crypto space, some people have more money than time or skills.
These people may be very creative or recognise a problem to solve, so a platform similar to Upwork or Fiverr would facilitate the linkup and development of multiple ideas & projects.
The way forward
I am happy to work on this with my team & contractors, work with others in the Cardano space or develop the foundation and then step behind a decentralise team. Let me get started building a team of like-minded individuals and then decentralise the operation for maximum efficiency.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This is the most ambitious of the three proposals I've submitted this round. Part of my motivation is to better understand the core semantics of Plutus, and the other part is to provide a way to use the high performance actor model capabilities of the Pony programming language for applications on the Cardano platform.
My other proposals this round could benefit from this:
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Collaboration-Protocol/369937-48088#
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Elm-Integration-with-Plutus/370150-48088
Working on distributed collaboration would benefit from the types of simulations that are made easy with Pony's concurrency model, and the flexibility of Pony's type system. Pony also has lock-free memory safety and object capabilities that can protect different parts of a system from gaining access to functionality they shouldn't have.
The possibility of compiling Elm code to Plutus Core would open the door to tightly coupling frontend code with on-chain code, and integration with a highly scalable backend that's possible with this project.
Timeline:
Three Months: There are different ways to interface Pony with Plutus. My current thought is that writing a Plutus Core interpreter would be the most useful way to do this, but I'm open to suggestions. This would require expressing Plutus Core semantics in terms of the Pony type system, which is what I'd be spending the initial phase of this project working on. This would open the door to running Plutus code in Pony for use as a side chain, or generating Plutus code to be run on the main chain. I'll probably drop the Haskell implementation of the Plutus Core interpreter into my codebase to test against the output of the code I write. It's also possible that I could import the Haskell code as a library into Pony, which would probably be less work, but the current story of how to load Haskell code into a C-style FFI isn't ideal. I'm not sure about loading a Pony module into a Haskell codebase. The first phase of this project is about research and setting an optimal plan in place.
Six Months: At this point, I should be well on my way to producing a library for interfacing Pony and Plutus! All the code and documentation that I write will be open source, and pushed to the git repository attached to this proposal. I'm open to any feedback and help that the community might want to provide.
Twelve Months: Hopefully, there will be a working library that developers can use to add distributed stream processing and actor-based simulations to their Plutus applications... for side chains or off-chain code.
(Depending on the acceptance of my other proposals, timelines would be subject to change, and I reserve the right to interleave work on each project as I see fit. Some of the research I do for the other projects could give direction to this one and vise versa.)

#######################
#What is an API service about?
For developers to build dapps, wallets, NFT marketplaces, etc, they require to query the Cardano blockchain. This is currently done via a database syncing tool called db-sync. The developers have to run their own infrastructure for this and that they end up wasting a lot of time on infrastructure than the actual product. An API service provides serverless highly scalable APIs for the developers to use and build apps without relying on their own backend systems.
 
#What can a developer do with this service?
Developers can build pretty much everything on Cardano using this API service, some common applications range from implementing pool updates on their website to, bots, etc.
This API service would also allow developers to submit transactions on the network. This will be a backbone for the new smart contract era on Cardano, that developers will be able to use this service to build swap, dex, etc. This can also be a great service for a wallet backend, which will allow many developers to build Cardano wallets without worrying about the infrastructure. So to summarise, major use cases are as below,

Dexes
Swaps
Wallet Backends
ADA Payment Gateways
Native Asset Metadata and queries
NFT marketplace listing APIs
Analytics dashboards
Smart contracts metadata APIs
Telegram bots
Pool tracking tools

 
#Is there a similar service?
There is a service for a similar use case, Blockfrost. We believe that having a choice for the community is a big plus and that we need a few infrastructure providers for this big ecosystem.
 
#Who are we?
We are the company behind the Cardanoscan explorer, the widely used Cardano blockchain explorer.

We have been funded in the catalyst for testnet explorer and delivered it successfully https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/
We are also funded for the Cardano networking library in JS, which is currently being developed as per the plan

###################
#What is Bip32Ed25519?
Cardano uses HD wallet implementation based on the key derivation scheme of Bip32Ed25519, which is published by IOHK researchers. All of the wallets you have used for ADA, every one of them generates your ADA addresses based on this cryptography. The reference implementation of this spec is available only in Haskell, and Rust. Most of the wallets use either of these packages compiled in WASM, or Emscripten to be used in browsers.
 
#Why do we need a JS version?

It is difficult to contribute to Rust or Haskell libraries for developers
It is difficult to use these compiled libraries in Nodejs, browser, and specifically ReactNative/NativeScript or other cross-platform mobile apps
A lightweight, non compiled library will be very useful for devs building extremely lightweight, and smaller apps, that only need to generate Cardano addresses, or just sign a message (transaction hash)
This is a low-level package that will be used to build a Cardano wallet library in pure JS.

 
#What can a developer do with this package?
Developers can create super lightweight functionalities into the apps for signing transactions, generating addresses. This is a low-level package that is a pillar for all the JS-based tooling on Cardano cryptography.
We will be building a Cardano serialization library in pure JS, which will use this package for cryptography-related functionalities. Which in turn will be used by many dapps building on Cardano for executing frontend level logic in browser and extensions and mobile apps.
 
#Who are we?
We are the company behind the Cardanoscan explorer, the widely used Cardano blockchain explorer.

We have been funded in the catalyst for testnet explorer and delivered it successfully https://testnet.cardanoscan.io/
We are also funded for the Cardano networking library in JS, which is currently being developed as per the plan

Our fund 6 proposals for a wallet library in JS, that will utilize this package. https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Wallet-lib-in-pure-JS-TS/370043-48088
We have already worked on this package and a pre-production implementation of this is being used by our wallet in testnet. Hence, we are confident that we can deliver a production version, test it and document this package and do necessary upgrades as part of this proposal.

#What is a wallet library?
Wallet library is a low-level implementation to provide Cardano address, transaction serialization, signing, and transaction building functionality. This library will be a pure JS implementation that it can run in the browser and cross-platform mobile apps with ease without any WASM loading required.
 
#Why do we need a JS version?

The goal is to provide as much tooling as possible to JS developers
Easier to maintain and upgrade
A lightweight alternative to the current Rust based package

 
#What can a developer do with this package?
This is a low-level library to build Cardano transactions, this would allow a host of wallet applications to be built for the ecosystem. A lightweight package to spin up a wallet as quickly as possible in the backend using Nodejs or in the browser, an extension, and mobile apps. This will also be the library to be used by dapps to build transactions.
This library will also support building smart contract transactions for Alonzo.
In a nutshell,

build web, extension, mobile wallets
build smart contract transactions (Alonzo era tx)
integrate with dapps
sign messages
verify ownership

Everyday I meet creative people eager to roll up their sleeves and write application on Cardano but they are blocked because they are not programmers or engineers. 
Everyday I meet seasoned engineers who want to use Plutus but can't become freshers to start at the bottom of the mountain to learn to be a functional programmer and Haskell a programer, and learn about blockchain. 
This proposal fast-forwards the evolution of the Cardano  ecosystem to the current era where No-Code is expected to account for 65% of all software development. Our team has developed the no-code platform, QModeler, from first principles that allows non-technical users to build smart contracts and use formal verification to ensure conformance with requirement.

This project allow non-techies to build and deploy smart contracts to Plutus. To accomplish this we need to build an adapter on  Plutus, the  adapter will run as a Plutus smart contract

Ferdon is a company of currently 20 people passionate about democratizing technology, in particular Blockchain. Ferdon has been working 3 and a half years to build our flagship product, QModeler, one of the first no-code platforms and the first no-code platform for blockchain. QModeler is capable of synthesizing models into smart contracts - we currently support Ethereum and Hyperledger but are working on a Plutus integration. QModeler's audience is the Citizen Developer.
Ferdon is launching the first of its kind, no-code hackathons, long-running events that bring together communities to solve pressing issues using No-Code tools.
Ferdon's active projects include

In collaboration with WADA we have launched a first of its kind no-code hackathon to develop a solution for food safety traceability in Africa.
Launching a no-code hackathon in Vietnam in December to develop a solution to food traceability in Vietnam.

Citizen Developers are are people with little to no knowledge of programming who build software using No-Code platforms like QModeler. The advent of No-Code has created a sea change in the way software is developed by allowing Citizen Developers to build software and communities to work collaboratively to create software solutions to problems. Citizen Developer is a new term to describe someone who is participating in building software products despite having little or no technical knowledge. The growth of Citizen development is estimated to be 30% per year will overtake programming development in the next 3 years.
N O   C O D E  H AC K A T H O N S
No-Code hackathons are long-running events,  3-6 month or even longer,  that brings people of all backgrounds together together around the task of creating software to solve a problem.  We hope to soon use No-Code hackathons to include Plutus smart contracts using QModeler. Follow the progress of no-code hackathons at  https://www.cardanonocode.com/

We believe technology should unite and not divide us. We strive to democratize technology by simplifying it so that innovation happens across all strata of society. Our vision will be realized when any sized company, from enterprise to a small business owner, or even a single person with a yen to create, can innovate solutions to their problems. Ferdon - the maker of Qmodeler is its located in Vietnam. QModeler is a supporter of the Vietnam National Computer Olympic Team where many of our team members competed.

Too often we forget to ask our selves the simple questions, how is the world better off with this project?  The team believes the answer is a resounding Yes, so we will start out by enumerating the problems we overcome and how our proposal can overcome them to create a better world. 
Fewer than 0.001 of the community have the background or experience to build a smart contract.
Cardano is dependent on community to grow but sadly a lot  of creativity is unused because the implementation of an idea requires deep technical knowledge and programming experience. This project will allow anyone to build smart contracts regardless if they have can program or have a technical background
The number of people in the development community who will master Plutus smart contract is still very small
Today, programming a Plutus smart contract requires mastering several difficult topics like Functional Programming, Haskell, Blockchain...  training in even one of these technologies is a daunting task, let alone all of them. This project allows developers to develop smart contracts without having to master functional programming, Haskell or have a deep understanding of blockchain or Cardano tools.
Blockchain disrupts economies, Citizen Development helps ensures economy are quickly rebuilt using a decentralized model
While blockchain empowers by changing fundamentals of economic relationships and structures, thus creating opportunities, no-code allows individuals and communities to capitalize on these opportunities by building software that makes sense for them and liberates them from needing to pay high software license fees, sign long contracts with large companies, or agree to change their processes. This project will allow people to self-determine how the decentralized economy works for them.
Benefits of disintermediation of blockchain can be dampened if the high cost of application development partially replaces middle man fees thus.
The power of disintermediation brought about by blockchain can be dampened by dependencies on solution providers whose costs can partially replace middle-man fees and, as is often the case, are too expensive for communities or even entire countries.
Applications such as food traceability, market accessibility, identity, cold chain should be available to everyone
Many solutions today, even blockchain solutions, are out of the reach of people in developing countries who are priced out of the benefits they provide. Citizen Development is about taking control and finding solutions to ones problems and not being dependent on others. This projects allows people to build solutions for themselves even if they need smart contracts
A better return for the developer
In the centralized model of software development we inherited, the developer gets paid for his work one time while the company that markets his product gets paid each time his product is sold. By building a component that can be used by Citizen Developers the developer can earn a passive revenue stream from his work created by users who adopt. This project allows developers just concentrate on developing and not give up 99% of the revenue to those who market their products.
Better software availability
Large software implementors are used to building a one-size-fits-all application  with little customization. They then have the power to force us to pay for using software that was built, in many cases, without consulting what we needed.  Small farmers, for instance only the option of relying on supply chain software build by large implementors that don't fit their need or budgets. This project helps make software affordable, even in niches where the market is small.
 
S M A R T   C O N T R A C T   C R E A T I O N   A S   A   H U M A N   R I G H T
As decentralization transforms our economy we see the cost of building blockchain applications being so prohibitive out of reach of those who were the beneficiaries of disintermediation. The first use blockchain for international payments were the large banks, the first well know use of supply chain management was IBM and Maersk Shipping - the largest shipper in the world- and the story goes on and onPeople have a right to have a say in how decentralized systems that affect their education, identity, are built. They have a right to have a hand in building the new decentralized world. This is more than a right, this is a human right.
M A R L O W    C O M P A R I S O N
From time to time I am often asked how QModeler compares with Marlow
Targeted Demographics -QModeler targets the""Citizen Programmer"" who has little or no technical training. Marlow uses blocky which was intended to teach programming. Our own usability tests as well as others shows Blockly is too complex for ""Citizen Programmers"". More on citizen programmers :https://tinyurl.com/4z33rx8r .
Greater Flexibility - Components must be flexible enough to allow Citizen Programmers freedom to build what they want. For instance in the blocky program I may want to take half the amount in escrow, I may want to pay the arbitrator 10% of the funds for incentivization, I may want to wait until all bids are in and select the highest bidder.  
Does Not Use Code Generation - Code generation is an approach with a 15 year history of failure by companies like IBM and Microsoft. Generated code is error prone. Blockly is built on code generation,
Easy Process for Building Components - It must be very easy to build a new component. Users will find use cases that are not handled by existing components and it must be possible to build these components quickly. Otherwise it becomes like Wordpress where you get 95% of features you want out of the box but getting the remaining 5% features may require you to abandon Wordpress.
Formal Verification of Conformance to Business Requirements - the model should be formally verified and results displayed to the user or development will be a very slow process. QModeler formally verifies the models in realtime and supplies feedback on how to fix the models. QModeler
Team Support - The platform should contain versioning, teams, admin.
Support for Requirements Engineering - QModeler supports full SLCD by the Citizen Programmer. Applications are formally verified against requirements before deployment .
Persona Based Visual Languages - The platform should support persona based visual languages that have the right tradeoffs and flexibility and abstraction for multiple personas Addresses Integration - QModeler addresses Cardano as part of a broader ecosystem of off-chain components

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We would like to initiate a programme of work that helps projects building on Cardano build faster with less risk by giving them access to user insights, user needs & behaviours. These actionable insights will create a framework that will help teams to adopt a user centric view of their products and services which will be particularly helpful when defining their MVP and beyond
We would do this by:
Conducting a number in depth interviews and workshops with projects within the ecosystem gaining an understanding of their needs, goals and potential pain points. Understand where their projects may encounter real users and where they need further support in terms of insight. This may be from consumers or perhaps focused on enterprise or governments.
Synthesizing this primary research will likely uncover patterns and common needs for these and pipeline projects that will require further investigation. These will then be prioritised based on the collective needs of the projects and the value they could bring to the development community.
Design researchers will be tasked with gaining these user insights using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods including video interviews, surveys etc. Primarily remotely but with some travel for group workshops if necessary and travel restrictions allow. The results will then be synthesized and assembled into a series of design documents to help projects make better user focused product decisions. Typical outputs would be intended to help inform design and development teams and may be in the form of user need statements, personas or user journeys that indicate possible friction points and opportunities to delight.
The intention is that these insights which would grow over time and be augmented by the community would form a knowledge resource hub that could be accessed by any project building within our ecosystem.
What does success look like after 3/6/9/12 months?
First 3 months, mobilised a core international team and identified key projects to engage with together with objectives and methodology.
Within 6 months we would of engaged with key projects and identified prioritised research/UCD objectives for the primary research.
By 9 months, we will be actively engaging with geographically dispersed user participants.
By month 12 we will have synthesized research insights into easily consumable design documents and will be actively sharing with the community and assembling a research prioritized backlog from community feedback.
How I address the challenge question
Creating a knowledge base around user centric research and design will ultimately empower teams, to unlock their projects potential. Understanding the landscape and people that are ultimately using or affected by their proposed development, products or tools will reduce development risk and expedite product design decisions. Understanding user needs goals and motivations helps devs considerably to focus on elements that add human value. Embedding this user centred process and creating communities around this will raise this agenda, increase conversations about people and usability- ultimately making the Cardano eco system more valuable to humans.
Public launch date:
Design/ research teams would work in the open in an iterative an collaborative way which would mean assets could be available for consumption by developers within months on an alpha basis. This is a scalable proposal and ultimately the end rather than launch date will depend on the volume of effort required.

This is a Catalyst improvement proposal to encourage entrepreneurs to create smaller proposals.
We introduce proposers to a new process where we can go through the funding process faster compared to the Catalyst process. Upon entering into the process you are introduced to the Mini-Proposal model which guides your journey to create a valid proposal. We will be having several workshops and events to improve and share our work in an open environment. At the end of the funding cycle, the best proposals will get immediately funded. Even if you don't get funded you will be finishing with a great proposal.
 
Funding Cycle
Each funding cycle lasts 5 weeks.
Then there is 3 week period where we will improve our processes before we start another Cycle
Funding
Which mini-proposal gets funded is decided by community members who join the Chainvote application.
First funding cycle voting model: 1 person 1 vote.
After seeing the result of the first cycle we have the option collectively to improve the voting method.
The proposals will also be uploaded in the Ideascale. This will create a feedback loop between the participants of the mini-proposal ecosystem and the rest of the Cardano voting community.
If as a collective we fund a proposal and the same proposal also wins in Ideascale then the money returns back to the mini proposal treasury to start new funding cycles.
If Ideascale proposal gets funded while as a collective we did not fund it, then the funds will go directly to the proposer.
 
Our goals
- Funded proposals deliver with the solution were provided on the proposal
- Proposals funded through this process will also get funded through the Ideascale process
Measurements we track and want to reach
How many mini-proposals are created and go through this process? Goal to get over 30
How many proposers do we reach? Goal to get over 10
How many people vote on proposals? Goal to get over 40
How much is left in treasury? Goal to get enough returns to provide the 4th funding cycle
How much of the treasury comes back? Goal to get back 60% of pre-funded proposals
How many funded proposals are executed? Goal to see 100% of funded proposals to be executed on
How many non-funded proposals are executed? Goal to see over 6% non funded proposals to be executed on
How many developers work on these funded mini-proposals?
Some proposals might require developers, goal to see a third of the proposals attracting developers to help deliver the solution.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Heidrun, originally created to support the Adosia IoT project (Fund3 deliverable), is an open source platform API that enables developers a simple self-hosted means to rapidly integrate both accepting Cardano payments as well as add support for user or app initiated Cardano native asset withdrawals directly into custom applications.  Heidrun exists as a standalone node, operates completely independent of smart contracts, and is Cardano ""node-less"" (currently utilizes BlockFrost API). The primary market for Heidrun entails any rapid TTM (time to market) Cardano integrations where the deploying party is a known trusted party (often where no hard requirement for smart contracts is present).  Heidrun currently supports dashboard overview, API key management, payment wallets, drop wallets, and two separate API job functions - TrackPaymentAndCallback and TrackPaymentAndDropAsset.  
 
 
 
The intent of this proposal is to secure adequate funding ($25k) to expand existing Heidrun functionality to add support for the new methods. Expanding Heidrun functionality will rapidly expand the breadth of applications and builders on Cardano.
 
Current Heidrun Methods:
TrackPaymentAndCallback function enables setting up a Heidrun job to trigger a custom predefined action (webhook callback) upon detecting a specific Ada payment (leaves the inbound payment wallet utxo alone).  TrackPaymentAndDropAsset function enables dropping a native asset on detecting a specific Ada payment (consumes the entire payment wallet utxo returning any excess Ada amount to the target address along with the native assets).
 
Proposed (New) Heidrun Methods / Functionality:
- enable Multi-Asset Support for Drop Wallets - $25k 
 
 
All funds ($25k) will be used for development and developer compensation.
 
Adosia is currently using Heidrun to:
- accept Ada payments for custom IoT triggering upon Ada payment receipt
- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia SaaS subscriptions
- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia IoT platform account and device upgrades wit
- accept Ada payments for on-platform ADO token purchases
- accept Ada payments to enable ADO token withdrawals
 
Target public launch date: 4/1/2022
 
Definitions of success:
- after 3 months the implementation plan will be complete
- after 6 months all technical deliverables will have been met
- after 12 months we would like to see numerous new applications utilizing multi-asset drop applications based on Heidrun
 
Kyle Solomon (FROG / WOLF) is a seasoned Cardano stake pool operator, developer and community contributor, a creator of spacecoins and jetchicken, co-founder of SPOCRA and the founder of the Adosia IoT open hardware project.

Heidrun exists as a standalone node, operates completely independent of smart contracts, and is Cardano ""node-less"" (currently utilizes BlockFrost API). The primary market for Heidrun entails any rapid TTM (time to market) Cardano integrations where the deploying party is a known trusted party (often where no hard requirement for smart contracts is present).  Heidrun currently supports dashboard overview, API key management, payment wallets, drop wallets, and two separate API job functions - TrackPaymentAndCallback and TrackPaymentAndDropAsset.  
 
 
 
The intent of this proposal is to secure adequate funding ($20k) to expand existing Heidrun functionality to add support for the new methods. Expanding Heidrun functionality will rapidly expand the breadth of applications and builders on Cardano.
 
Current Heidrun Methods:
TrackPaymentAndCallback function enables setting up a Heidrun job to trigger a custom predefined action (webhook callback) upon detecting a specific Ada payment (leaves the inbound payment wallet utxo alone).  TrackPaymentAndDropAsset function enables dropping a native asset on detecting a specific Ada payment (consumes the entire payment wallet utxo returning any excess Ada amount to the target address along with the native assets).
 
Proposed (New) Heidrun Methods / Functionality:
- integrate API endpoints for core application to query Heidrun jobs and relevant job status in order to better reconcile application state
 
- integrate management GUI tools to easily identify erroneous payments, and issue one-click ""refunds"" for failed jobs or invalid payments amounts
 
All funds ($20k) will be used for development and developer compensation.
 
Adosia is currently using Heidrun to:
- accept Ada payments for custom IoT triggering upon Ada payment receipt
- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia SaaS subscriptions
- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia IoT platform account and device upgrades wit
- accept Ada payments for on-platform ADO token purchases
- accept Ada payments to enable ADO token withdrawals

Adosia's Heidrun enables developers similar abilities, but with much more customization for custom applications (accept payments, issue custom callback webhooks and drop native assets).
 
https://github.com/adosia/Heidrun
 
 
Marketing both of these tools aggressively will serve the Cardano community greatly by attracting new integration opportunities and developers to the Cardano ecosystem.
 
How funds will be used: 
The objective will be to create a sophisticated marketing funnel to attract, convert and segment out interested developers by individual interest. We will create valuable content, place content-specific (interest identifying) retargeting buckets on said content, and then execute paid marketing campaigns to promote that content. From there we can execute retargeting campaigns with the primary goal of educating developers and converting email address opt-ins.
 
By segmenting developer interests we can position to help guide a significant list of developers with identifying the best tool(s) or communities within the Cardano ecosystem to help feed their interests and meet their needs.
 
- content marketing - $5k
- paid targeting campaigns: youtube, social campaigns - $15k
- paid targeting campaigns: display ads - $3k
- retargeting - $5k
- email harvesting - $2k
 
 
Target public launch date: 12/15/2021 (Christmas code is the best code)
 
Definitions of success:
 - after 3 months we would like to see the campaign achieve success at converting emails favorably, see developers building real things on Cardano, validate the relevant community driven marketing model for drawing new businesses, developers and applications to Cardano, and see developers begin to deploy more WooCommerce Mercury integrations
 
 - after 6 months we would like to see developers begin to deploy more custom applications utilizing Heidrun and rearchitect this marketing model to accommodate all useful community tools - then align for future funds to rinse and repeat
 
 - after 12 months we would like to see 1M+ new users on Cardano

Problem Statement (continued)
With blockchain and NFTs surging, the interest for new ways to use blockchain in games continues to grow. The video game market is bigger than music and film combined [1] yet NFTs are still in their infancy. In 2020, there were over 2 billion users in just Unity [2] and 7 million developers. In addition to the wide indie scene Unity appeals to, Unreal Engine also attracts a similar number of developers at 7.5 million according to CEO Tim Sweeny [3]. Despite such a thriving ecosystem of developers and record breaking revenue from the video game industry, blockchain integration is few and far between.
While there have been solid efforts to integrate blockchain into UE4 [4] [5] and Unity [6], there still remain some pain points for developers that remain to be solved. While there will inevitably be efforts to add Cardano to these ecosystems, we believe it is not a small undertaking and requires professional experience to go from creating a passable tool/plugin to creating a robust, industry-ready plugin. Professional game industry experience for what developers actually want, professional experience creating these tools, and finally extensive knowledge of the blockchain/cardano ecosystem is needed. Finally, even after hooking into these systems, we believe being able to cross communicate between in-game worlds and other platforms is a must for mass adoption.
Summary of current problems:

Solid attempts have been made, but no professional attempts with experience of game industry knowledge, professional game development experience, or cardano expertise have been made
Creating a plugin is ""easy""; creating an industry ready tool is hard
After the plugin is written, it is not connected to a rich ecosystem yet
Getting professional developers from the game industry is hard
Lacking adoption once tools are released

Describe Your Solution To The Problem (continued)
We have assembled a diverse team with a veteran advisory board with years of experience at gaming company titans such as Epic Games and Riot Games (see full list below). Paired with our team of executives from the tech industry, marketing professionals, and game development experts; we are poised to dive in and create tools/plugins for everyone in the game industry and for Cardano to find mass adoption.
To accomplish this, we have a veteran team of senior developers from the company that makes Unreal Engine as well as experience building plugins for these platforms. Their resumes speak for themselves and are highly qualified to create industry-ready plugins and are aware of the tough road ahead of making sure the tools are robust enough and easy to use for developers of all skill levels to pick up and use.
In addition to creating the plugins, they will also be plugged into the rich ecosystem of https://logosphere.io with data that can be linkable across other platforms and games or even ecosystems outside of the game itself!
We also understand there is more work to be done even after creating robust tools. Other developers and companies need to know about it! Using Chris's experience with marketing (see experience below), we will push out status updates along the way as well as market to game developers when the tools are ready - or ready to be tested in Beta. Landing with a big splash helps grow adoption. We also know the frustrations from using a tool that is no longer supported, so we plan on keeping the team on staff as long as there are updates to be made before transitioning support over to Ikigai Technologies.
Deliverables:
• Unreal Engine (UE4) 
     • Plugin
     • Integration to UE Marketplace
     • Wallet integration
     • Fluree / Logosphere integration
     • Player-to-Player marketplace tooling

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.
Our business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.
This approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services

COST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.
MATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.
TRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?

We solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. 
We solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.
Another great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.
The key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.
Technical approach
The web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.

Check out a popular public lecture he gave on gravitational waves (https://youtu.be/Dn33_ySzB-w).
(We are cousins.)
Timeline
Development of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.
The definition of success after 3 months is a complete REST API with working wallet integration.
The definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.
The definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!
Campaign suitability
Since our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple campaigns. This proposal will support our efforts to customize Tutorchain for use in the Cardano ecosystem. Interacting with the Cardano community, we have repeatedly received the comment ""I would use the service if it existed!"" So we will try to bring it to you. The success of an expert marketplace relies on an initial critical mass of high-quality experts, good marketing to in-need learners, and good customer service to work out the kinks. We are requesting $15k to support these efforts. A successful tutorchain for Cardano will mean that new developers can quickly get the advice they need at an affordable price, and that existing developers can monetize their expertise. This will help grow the ecosystem.
Why should Catalyst voters support this project?
While the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good ""geek out"" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.
We think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common ""lack of developer buy-in"" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.

We will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824. You can also contact us using the contact form on our website tutorchain.io.
We hope to earn your trust in this exciting experiment in decentralized grantmaking!

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The rapidly growing community of Cardano developers are creating an impressive number of innovative systems and tools. The remarkable diversity of projects gives rise to a problem. How can the need for a wide range legal expertise be met in a cost effective way?
Here is a small sample of the legal questions the developer community faces. What kinds of templates are needed for a wide range of smart contracts for the sale of homes, cars, insurance and loans? What safeguards are needed to protect the privacy of personal information in DIDs? What do DeFi dApp developers need to do in order to meet legal requirements governing securities and loans? How to effectively advocate for reasonable blockchain policy?
Legal expertise is expensive. How can we meet the growing needs of the developer community in a cost effective manner--especially for projects that are in the early stages of growth?
The aim of this project is to create a network of lawyers and law students able to supply a pool of legal expertise for the growing developer community. Some projects need a little legal input. Others need well formulated contract templates. Whiles others may need to add legal expertise to their teams.
Many young lawyers are attracted to the practice of law because they believe legal advocacy has the power to help realize a fairer world. In this vein, many lawyers who are largely unaware of the potential of the smart contracts will naturally be excited to learn about the vision being articulated by leaders in the blockchain ecosystem--such as Charles Hoskinson--for building economic and social tools that will create new opportunities and help level the playing field for all. We aim to draw these lawyers and law students into the Cardano Catalyst community and help connect them with developers running projects.
Our team will create a set of online tutorials for lawyers and law students to introduce them to the legal questions that arise in the context of different types of developer projects. Educational resources are needed to bring a growing network of individuals having expertise in diverse areas of law up to speed about the rapidly developing smart contract ecosystem. The project aims to build a network supported by a broad range of social media resources to help lawyers connect with Cardano developers. In turn, collaborative legal research by the legal network will empower the community to advocate effectively for reasonable policy reforms.
Lead members of the team:

Jeff Downard, J.D., Ph.D., >25 years teaching jurisprudence, contracts, legal reasoning and theories of justice.
Sarah Holcomb, J.D., L.L.M., > 10 years teaching business and corporate law. More than 20 years practicing trusts, estates and tax law.
Tom Dietrich, J.D. > 15 years practicing contracts, IP, business law.
David Watts, M.S., experience teaching writing, mathematics. Current focus on blockchain full stack development.

MyVoice is a platform designed to connect citizens with legislation and their politicians on the federal level. At MyVoice we have to take on a problem very similar to the problem that blockchain faces. There is a jump in knowledge and perceived inaccessibility to understanding blockchain development and what blockchain can do. Similarly, MyVoice faces a problem about the jump in knowledge and perceived inaccessibility of political information. We are using this as a case study and the approach we take to bridge this divide can be used as lessons that drive technical literacy and learning in general with applications being developed that will radically change how we interact with the world.

Our connector will anchor off-chain databases/apps onto the Cardano blockchain, enabling those apps to integrate w/ smart contracts and back",8,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 04:23",Randall Harmon,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Randall-Harmon/3084778-48088,,,73024,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Many thousands of applications are written to use traditional databases including MongoDB, CouchDB, Postgres, Mysql and others. Anyone* can write a so-called ""oracle contract"" that polls these databases for content, but these contents would not necessarily have demonstrable cryptographic integrity. These integrations would also be ""one-off"".
We seek to prototype and develop at least one meaningful solution for integrating traditional database applications, allowing their data to be used for reliably making progress in on-chain contracts, and re-integrating the results back to those applications and/or their databases.
Creating a positive experience for developers: We will provide recipes and guidance for developers to create meaningful connections between existing off-chain applications (or even new off-chain apps!) using well-known database technology, with integrations to the Cardano mainchain for key in-app activities not limited to acceptance of payments.
Other challenge-brief details:

We expect that our work will directly impact the Number of developers actively building on top of Cardano because they'll be able to integrate existing applications and known operational platforms
...and attract developers from outside of our current community, for the same reasons
""have database integration solutions"" is one direct answer to What do developers want, to get onboard in Cardano
... and the same is true for enterprise dev managers - reducing their risk profile during blockchain integration projects

Gimbalabs will conduct this effort using our project-based learning program. We will also actively involve YOU, the community, in recognizing and building out the scope. Want to have your name on a budget line item for this proposal? Join us at a Gimbalabs Playground and be together with us.
 
 
The first slice: Database-to-sidechain
The first part of our current scope involves streaming changes from at least two databases, selected in consultation with the community, into a merkle-tree capturing the state of those databases as they change.
Once connected to the database's evolving state, capturing the progress of the database (similar to tracking the master branch of a git repository) involves:

tracking the changing merkle root (commit hash @master, over time)
committing the merkle root to the Cardano blockchain on an application-specified schedule using a smart contract
retaining the underlying data for future reference

In this last step, all of this database content can be held privately, all the data blinded on-chain behind cryptographic hashes. Its on-chain usefulness arrives in the third slice of our scope.
We plan to implement at least two connectors for traditional database servers and a ""server agent"" that implements the steps described above.
For the side-chain storage tier, we will evaluate at least three technical storage options that produce blockchain-compatible merkle trees, and choose at least two to use for prototyping, proving key success criteria for each storage technique, and reporting on other factors found in our study and research.
 
The second slice: Additional data extraction
A useful detail at step 1.1) above depends heavily on the application: some applications will get value from posting certain levels of additional detail about their database's merkle tree. These details can range from simply showing additional levels of their tree (still cryptographically blinded), to reveal selected public information onchain.
Because every application's needs are expected to be distinct if not unique, it's difficult to provide much additional detail about the capabilities at this step, beyond this: While these policies must be crafted to the specific needs of the application, their capabilities need not be limited by other than the applied ethics of the policy authors, constraints from the consensus rule of jurisdictional law, and consent of the other stakeholders engaged in relationship with the database oracle's owner/sponsor.
In this second slice, we will research and implement one or more mechanisms useful for application authors to indicate additional merkle-proofs and other data details to be anchored on-chain as part of the connector's normal operation.
We will also explore considerations and techniques targeted at balancing performance, transaction fees, and other runtime considerations, based on computational characteristics of the involved data structures, as well as through experience gained while applying such integrations. Exploring this technical landscape is a key set of research activities needed to identify, validate and mitigate risks, constraints, and opportunities... combining technique with vision and practical testing.
We will create a whitepaper reporting on the mechanisms we explored and results we found, with general recommendations and information about tradeoffs found during the research.
We will also provide training material demonstrating some practical use cases for this data-extraction capability in action, including integrating the results back to applications for further dataflow and human workflow.
 
The third slice: side-chain to contract: validating transactions with off-chain data
In the third slice of our scope, we will create prototype on-chain contracts to perform critical business-logic, taking into account key pieces of the underlying data. Remember, in slice one, hashes found in the merkle tree were the primary data anchored in on-chain transitions. At this stage, we address a need for on-chain smart contracts to USE some of the underlying data.
In this slice, we will develop protocols satisfying data-privacy goals and technical constraints, and allowing smart contracts to make progress while ensuring that the off-chain data from (1.1) above is and remains satisfying so-called ""business-logic"" constraints of the application.
 
The specific outcomes of this phase will include both the learnings found during the prototyping and research, which we will present as a whitepaper detailing practical considerations in achieving the goals, as well as reference smart contracts demonstrating key techniques for satisfying critical so-called ""business logic"" requirements for contracts collaborating with off-chain database applications.
This step involves some research and exploration of the range of possible implementation paths. Gimbalabs project-based-learning provides a perfect environment for exploring the problem space, analyzing effectiveness, and feeding back the results of the explorations back to the community.
 
Future: the fourth slice: re-integrating on-chain transactions to the traditional database
As transactions are executed on-chain (either in the transactions described above, or other transactions occurring on those same contracts), it will be useful to provide hooks for monitoring and re-integrating the results of those transactions to the application and/or to its database.
In the current proposal scope, we don't plan to deliver a result on for this slice, but we will incentivize GPLers to stretch and achieve it, providing at least two reference implementations of hooks that reflect meaningful updates back into the application tier, completing the cycle of integrating blockchain with traditional database applications.
 
Execution Plan: Community Engagement and Project-Based Learning
At Gimbalabs, learning through experience is one of our core values. Developing community and shared ownership is another.
Existing followers of the Plutus Pioneers program will be invited to be part of our project-based learning program, where the Catalyst funds will be used to grow the experience of Plutus learners and provide them with rewards for learning.
We will sponsor 3 community-development leaders, who will be rewarded directly for working together with our learners and for integrating the best results of the learning teams, forming the implementation. We will also sponsor a technical product manager and architect to provide leadership and guidance, assist with development of incremental, actionable milestones to the learning team. 
 
We are also allocating a focused reward for part-time contribution from two technical team members as needed to ensure we have every skill needed.  Are you at the top of your class?  Come and be with us on this amazing journey.
 
Details TBD: all of our plutus learners will earn a participation reward. We will issue bonus rewards for the first effective solution, the first fully unit-tested solution, and the best quality solution (passing the unit tests) at each milestone. Milestone-level rewards will be distributed from the total reward pool according to the number and difficulty of the separate milestones.

Create assurance standards for Cardano wallets to display human-readable promises and safeguards before people send payments to contracts.",18,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 02:26",Randall Harmon,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Randall-Harmon/3084778-48088,Adriano Fiorenza,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Adriano-Fiorenza/3099741-48088,68000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Summary: we will research and develop recommendations for all smart-contract developers and wallet authors to provide transparent labeling to end-users about the smart contracts they'll be engaging with.  By ensuring access to this labeling for every smart-contract on Cardano, we will send a clear signal to the world that this is a place where people can transact together more safely than they can on any other blockchain. 
 
How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?  -> BY delivering trust signals to end-users to enhance their experience and user trust at critical payment-sending moments during their onboarding to every Cardano-enabled app.
 
A simple example involves a set of people using an NFT-selling contract: the developer who wrote the contract, an artist who sells an NFT for their art using that contract, and people who buy the NFT and later resell it.  All of the people with an interest in this contract's results should be able to clearly see what expectations they can have when they use the contract (special thanks to Ken Adams (KEWW) for detailing this use-case in the Sept 8 community workshop in Catalyst After-townhall session). 
From NFT's to Auctions, from Real Estate to Loans: truth in labeling fosters user confidence.
That's our trust protocol: enabling all the stakeholders to have clear, human-readable information about each contract's behavior.  Enabling them to entrust their funds to smart contracts on the basis of being well informed.
 
As with many people, when I first encountered the idea of a smart contract, it was CryptoKitties.  I read an analysis based on disassembling the compiled Solidity contract and analyzing the resulting (still abstract) code to infer its behavior. The failure of Solidity to use Lambda calculus for expressing behavior functionally and compositionally was striking - oh, the many risks of programming something wrong by accident (so easy in procedural programming)! … all multiplied by arbitrary amounts of REAL MONEY.
More subtly, a whole class of risks became clear: that, even given a functional smart contract language (thank you Plutus!), allowing contracts to be ""verified correct"", certain types of behavior can be coded into them that would be undesirable to one or more of its stakeholders: siphoning fees during edge-cases, publishing identity details in on-chain metadata, or other forms of misbehavior. All while passing automated formal verifications.
 
Web 2.0 shifted the nature of user-experience, but it has extended the model where server-side components do black-box activities: no transparency, low accountability for the results. Web3 is bringing tectonic changes: distributed data streams, blockchain and other decentralized transaction dynamics… reliance on discrete central servers starts to fade away, and financial transactions are more and more easily integrated to the applications, but there remains little in the way of a TRANSPARENCY layer for people to know the effects of these applications - in particular, the financial effects, encoded in behaviors of smart contracts where their money is held in trust.
Currently, the general population relies on centralized authorities and payment providers to provide assurance and act as arbiters should transactions not be executed as they expected. While blockchain technology eliminates the need and costs of utilizing these authorities, the lack of recourse if transactions are not executed as expected further necessitates the general population's need for clear transparency and assurance in the behavior of the smart contract.
 
There are, without a doubt, many (or even most) current smart contracts running on Ethereum that are just doing a simple job, doing it reliably and with source code openly available. Even so, it all looks like ""dark web"" to the general population. Is that what we want for Cardano?
We assert that OUR ecosystem can thrive exponentially by providing transparent assurances and infrastructure for people to engage with and easily understand meaningful trust signals about all the smart contracts that will play roles in their lives.  Providing consumer-grade transparency and assurances about behavioral expectations from our smart contracts will enable Cardano to be Generally Recognized as Safe.
 
Challenge Metrics and Questions: Smart contracts being recognized as safe will enable for broader scale adoption, which in turn will encourage more developers to develop with Cardano.  That's essential to this challenge's brief.  Ditto, attracting developers from outside of our current community.  What are enterprise dev managers looking for? we think one major thing they want is to know that the blockchains they commit to will deliver them audience - that it is ready for primetime.
 
Open-sourcing our contracts is not enough. Passing them through automated formal validations is not enough. Even delegating validation to organizations specializing in human review is insufficient without publicly-visible promises:

Things this contract will do
Things this contract promises to NOT do

These protocols are tools that need to be developed at the early stage of smart contract development in Cardano to ensure that developers are aware of assurance standards as contracts are developed.
 
This proposal is cosponsored by Gimbalabs, where we are mobilizing everyone to develop tools and applications through a unique experience of co-creation that facilitates adoption of the Cardano protocol, reveals new possibilities, and ignites the public imagination worldwide.  Gimbalabs serves a large group of developers through its Playground network, which provides networking and professional development to the Cardano community.

Plan and scope
We will conduct market research to determine what are the key assurances that the general population expects before confidently executing a transaction.
We will develop data-structural schemas for expressing human-readable expectations for smart contracts, and safeguards to support transparency of what smart contracts will do. These data will be essential human input to formal verification processes, as well as for human-based code-review activities contributing to public trust in Cardano's smart-contract environment.
We will research and explore the feasibility landscape for techniques to connect smart contracts together with the ""product labels"" representing consumer expectations.
We will develop protocols for wallet software to find, validate and present the product labels for smart contracts used by wallets. We will design these protocols to be forward-compatible to accommodate future enhancements, with guidelines for wallets to also be forward-compatible. In scope for this research and development include such concerns as:

Smart-contract registration to a decentralized registry
Smart-contracts: parameterized vs generic, and reusing the labeling
Multi-contract transactions and transaction labeling

Timeline and Key Deliverables

Prior to Sept 9 2021, we will conduct a community session to explore these and other considerations for ensuring we are covering a reasonable scope around smart-contract transparency and labeling.
UPDATE - DONE: great context and input received.  +audience: smart-contract instantiators.  +audience: real-estate professionals.  +contributor: Noah Jones.  Thanks to you all for joining and expressing your interest, support and perspectives. We're stronger together!

 

In November 2021, we will conduct two additional community sessions to explore the problem space and provide  transparency around our initial research.  This will also help us to identify next opportunities for important additions to the protocol and establish a roadmap for further recommendations.  We will provide draft data schema(s) for transparency information about smart-contracts. 

 

In December 2021, we will deliver a whitepaper presenting our findings and recommendations, and if needed, one or more CIPs to formalize the best methods we find during our research. 

 

By the end of Jan 2022, we expect to provide a reference implementation in at least one wallet application, demonstrating a viable opt-in experience for people to review the contract labeling and make trust decisions. Adriano of the GameChanger wallet is ready and willing to do this work with us (thanks!), and we're keen to help him make GameChanger everything it can be, as well.

Community is an essential part of creating the next level of effectiveness for Blockchain.  Come help us develop plans, write prototypes and prove out techniques.  Help us refine our CIP(s).  We are including budget for community contributors.  Together, we can.
 
Success Metrics and Checkpoints
  ...at the 3-month mark: Delivered draft schemas, results of community-engagement and prototyping phase, and draft CIPs for requested protocol-enhancements.  Video updates.
  ...at the 6-month mark: Smart contracts having user-trust labeling metadata; percentage of new smart-contracts having attached user-trust metadata.
  ...at the 12-month mark: Engagement/trust metric: ""Do you understand and trust how smart contracts work on Cardano?""
Requested funds in USD

Market Research $5,000
Prototyping and technical proofs of concept: $12,000
Community participation rewards: $6,000
Wallet integration $21,000
Dandelion Service development: $8,000

Flex budget: Additional development, research and improvement proposals: $8,000

Total: $68,000
We have made an effort to balance our estimates between the conservative and the risk-averse, but we acknowledge that this is an unexplored problem space with a significant research component.  We remain committed to delivering meaningful guidance, data schemas, improvement proposals and in-app experiences to ensure that Cardano becomes the best-trusted blockchain available.  In the event of any cost overrun, we will request supplementary budget in future funds, with all supporting details provided in that proposal.
 
...compared to other proposals: One of our members is also proposing Smart Contract Blacklisting, which plans to respond to Emerging Threats in our ecosystem.  A contract with transparent labeling might still get flagged for the blacklist (say, for usurious fees or other reasons), and there are other distinct points of utility to be found on both paths.  Blacklisting has its own set of concerns, relating to reputation of issue-reporters, momentum for community-reported contract alerts, and more.  Thank you for recognizing the important distinctions and separate value for both truth-in-labeling and for smart-contract blacklisting.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This proposal is part of Logosphere (https://logosphere.io) - a Layer 2 metadata side-chain backed by Fluree - an open source decentralized semantic graph database; the initial proposal for which has been funded in Fund 5.
Problem Statement (continued):
Technical Problem:
If you've been a Java or Full Stack developer for a while, you definitely should have encountered various data persistence frameworks, such as Hybernate or Sequelize? If yes, then you should be familiar with the problem they are solving: to make sure that you work with higher level business entities when developing your application, and not spend too much of your valuable time manually crafting SQL queries, transaction statements or stored procedures directly against the database. However, these solutions are typically for relational databases and are centralized.
That is where Fluree, a semantic graph database, is perfect for, but there is a bit of a learning curve to understand all the concepts and start using it in your application. We'd like to facilitate Fluree adoption for you by creating a business model generator that will scaffold a dApp project customized to your business domain - we are calling it Logosphere.
Additionally, you can only interact with the data layer through one direction - traditional APIs / endpoints. You cannot interface with it through the other direction which is the smart contract.
The other part of the problem arises as the Ecosystem Problem:
Even if a project manages to deliver, it can be hard to incentivize developers to try using your product or platform. Growing adoption and awareness of your tool is paramount to collecting feedback and improving your platform. As it stands, there is no guarantee that developers will give what you've been working on a shot.
Describe your solution to the problem (continued):
Technical Solution:
Summary:

NPM library that bundles all Fluree benefits of decentralized graph databases and their paradigms into one package
Plutus/Marlowe library that allows developers to interface with their off-chain data layer in their smart contracts themselves

A Developer Flow will be condensed into:

You spend time where it counts and focus efforts thinking about your business domain, defining entities and their properties, constraints and constraint patterns
You provide a list of samples for each property of each entity in your business domain
You create this business model as JSON schema in some graphical editor (we recommend Hackolade)
You install Logosphere libraries from NPM, run the code generator initializing your DApp application and in 30 seconds you have the following:


Fluree DB running on your local machine with a ledger schema corresponding to your business domain and loaded with sample data generated from the JSON schema
Generated TypeScript interfaces
Base class that handles all the persistence and state management in Fluree DB
Business entity classes with getters and setters mapping to other entities according to the structure in JSON schema
Func stubs for writing custom code, without touching generated classes
Resolver stubs for GraphQL API interface
Validator that validates your entities against JSON schema
Haskell library with type classes and functions to store offchain data required by smart contracts in Logosphere
Marlowe TypeScript library with your business domain entities

Doable? We believe yes! (To tell you the secret, we've been already actively working on a product which will serve as a prototype to the logosphere ecosystem!)
Ecosystem Solution:
We've been working hard the last several months on our solution and using it in our internal product, and once we wrap it up, we will be opening the doors for all to join our two Hackathons for $25,000 in prizes:

Logosphere API Hackathon: Create a dApp with Logosphere API
Logosphere Smart Contracts Hackathon: add smart contract functionality with Plutus and Marlowe to your previous hackathon solution

More hackathon details will be released via our socials and through catalyst channels as we develop the schedule and format. Stay tuned for details! Note: team members will be allowed to participate, but exempt from winning any of the awards.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Problem Summary
There are many opportunities to perform data analysis on pool performance, but a lack of analytics-ready data for the community to access.
Our Solution
Our plan is to build an open-source analytics-ready dataset of Cardano stake pool data which provides the community a consolidated machine-learning ready dataset for the Cardano ecosystem
Data Sources

Cardano DB-Sync
SMASH Metadata
Extended metadata json files

The aim of this dataset will be to enable someone to answer such questions as:

What are the best performing stake-pools
What is the effect of pool parameter changes to performance over time
What are the optimal stake pool parameters to attract stake?
What's the rate of growth of stake pools?
What's the rate of attrition of stake pools?
What is my pledge earning vs my stake pool?

Deliverables
The output of this project would be an open-source Github repository containing data integration scripts and SQL Queries as well as associated schema documentation.
SQL scripts would be separated between DB-Sync only scripts, and extended scripts which require external data sources to be integrated so that developers who are already running DBSync can get maximum value without implementing the data integration components.
Additionally, if the Cardano Data Hub idea ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Analytics-Data-Hub/368258-48088 ) gets funded, this dataset will be integrated as one of the available datasets there.
Project Plan and Budget
The project will have 5 components:
Data Discovery / Requirements - $1,800

detailed data review and profiling of existing data sources
Collaboration with community on requirements

Data Modelling - $1,800

Modelling datasets based on available data and community input

Data Integration - $3,000

Creating data integration scripts to ingest external datasets

SQL Development - $1,800

Develop SQL views to aggregate and implement modelled data

Documentation - $1,200

Provide schema and user documentation for consumers and implementers of the data

Quality Assurance / Testing - $480

Total Budget: $10,080

Expected completion date would be 6-8 weeks after funding is received.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This would be a decentralized exchange for development work on Cardano blockchain, where people needing things developed could post ADA and other native digital assets as bounties into smart contracts that represent jobs(tasks) that DEVs could preform and receive the bounties from smart contracts on approved submitted work.
This will create more economic opportunities for DEVs worldwide, and make it easier from entrepreneurs/startups to find and work with DEVs because the smart contract will act as the escrow and the community and gamified leaderboard will showcase the top talent.
The Hackathon was a minimal viable product and proved people wanted ways to connect with DEVs and would post about projects and shared needs https://adamaker.space/open-source-experiential-learning%e2%80%8b/
And the Sponsored Challenges ADA MakerSpace raised were proof of the concept that businesses and startups will pay bounties, as this POC has over $8,000 in bounties for DEVs https://adamaker.space/hackathon-challenges/
The next steps would be to take what we learned from the hackathon participation and update the site for a better UI/UX and develop and test the smart contracts for tasks&bounties. 
$10,000 to develop smart contracts for Bounties (2-3 DEVs paid from this)
$8,000 to develop front-end user interface (2-3 DEVs paid from this)
100% of funding received will provide DEVs funding that work on this project
 3-6 Months after funding is received we would deliver fully functional DEV Bounty Platform as a Service to post development bounties with smart contract escrows.

Background
A robust developer ecosystem is dependent upon the ability of projects to easily and seamlessly integrate. The composability of dApps, and DeFi in particular, is one of the unique and most powerful value propositions of blockchain applications. An SDK that allows for the permissionless integration of a DEX with other dApps will be a powerful tool for developers in the ecosystem. 
Technical specification:
The SDK has 3 components:
1. DEX Library
This component is in charge of the business logic of our constant-product AMM like calculating the number of tokens in DEX operations, finding the best trading route, etc.
2. Plutus Application Frontend (PAF)
This component will work like the PAB (Plutus Application Backend), but on the frontend and completely decentralized (no off-chain footprints). It will take care of constructing a correct Alonzo transaction from a set of UTxOs, datums, and redeemers. This Alonzo transaction can be further consumed by SDK users to build a composed atomic transaction.
3. React component
A modern React component allows easy integration of our DEX swap interface into any application or wallet with minimal time and cost. The React component is based on the DEX Library and the PAF, and is fully customizable and stylable.
Team
Our team has experience working in big companies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Vingroup, Sea Group and contributing to big open source projects like Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus.
We have got Innovation Award at NEO Hackathon Tokyo, thus demonstrating our knowledge about DeFi and blockchain.
We are all also part of the Plutus Pioneer Program, Alonzo White and Alonzo Purple.
We have had fully integrated DEX demos since June on our Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MinswapDEX
Minswap won Catalyst Fund5 for proposal Minswap - Multi-pool DEX.
Definition of success/Roadmap:
- 3 months: Open-source beta version of the SDK with React component and basic documentation that is ready to be used by interested projects.
- 6 months: Polish the API and documentation, release the first stable version (v1). Establish open-source contribution standard/process and merge feature requests from the community. The SDK is expected to be used by many applications and wallets. Release Vue component.
- 12 months: The SDK is expected to be used by most applications and wallets as a standard way to swap Cardano native tokens.
Budget breakdown:
One part-time senior TypeScript engineer working in 3 months: $13200.
One full-time senior blockchain engineer working in 3 months: $26400.
The hourly rate is $50.

Background
A key component of creating a positive developer ecosystem that empowers builders is having an effective community fundraising model for projects. The ISO has proven to be such a model for Cardano. Developing an open-source toolkit that allows developers to easily and efficiently run an ISO would be a powerful catalyst for the developer ecosystem.
Technical specification:
The toolkit has 2 main components:
1. Reward calculator:
- This component is packaged as a CLI program that can connect to an instance of DB Sync and calculate ISO rewards.
- It supports calculating rewards based on ADA rewards or a fixed amount distributed to delegators every epoch.
- It supports multiple stake pools for Fair ISO.
2. Reward sender:
- Because of a minimum of 1-2 ADA when sending native tokens, it is a common practice for projects that want to distribute their tokens to ask investors to send them 2 ADA before sending back native tokens with the minimum ADA per UTxO (learn more: https://docs.cardano.org/native-tokens/minimum-ada-value-requirement).
- This component is packaged as a running server that can watch incoming transactions to an address in DB Sync, check for eligible rewards, and send back the rewards.

The goal is to provide high quality oracle data for resolving prediction smart contracts. We will use this for our ALLIN betting app but the technology can be applied to many types of smart contracts and application use cases.
Token holders will be able to earn income and gain monetizable expertise recognition and reputation by providing correct and timely results for events.
When an event completes, token holders will have the opportunity to stake an amount of tokens with their provided result.
Once a minimum multiple of the value of the smart contract has been staked, a pending result is determined to be the provided result with the most stake.
There will then be a settlement period during which participants in the smart contract can appeal the pending result.
If there is not an appeal, the smart contract is resolved with the pending result which is now finalized.
If there is an appeal, then token holders who have sufficient domain expertise and reputation can then stake their tokens with the result.
Once an appropriate amount is staked, this will finalize the result.
Research into the incentives, disincentives, fees, and specific rules will be done to provide an economically viable system that is not easy to subvert.
Development Overview
We are using agile development practices and design specification is underway.
Our goals for this funding round are:
Design and specification of algorithms, incentives and processes involved in prediction outcome verification.
Development of Plutus smart contracts.
We will develop the smart contracts in a public github repository with open source licensing for use by other Cardano community projects.
We are aiming for a Q2 2022 launch for our initial release.

As the Cardano ecosystem grows, there is a bigger need for localization and translations. 
Checking the winner-proposals of previous funds, there were several winners of ""Localization"" proposals. Therefore I decided to submit this proposal and try to contribute with my knowledge of the languages I'm fluent in Ukrainian and Russian.
After many conversations with people in the Cardano ecosystem, here is my understanding of what should be translated:
- Interfaces of Cardano projects, dapps, sites. (Some of them have teams and budget for this, but other - not. We would be happy to help)
- Translation of Plutus Pioneers program (subtitles)
- Translation (subtitles) for other Cardano tutorials, workshops (i.e. Adamakerspace)
- Translation of the main articles, news from the Cardano ecosystem  
- Translation of the main updates by Charles Hoskinson
- Translation of Project Catalyst
We would be happy to hear your thoughts about what should be translated according to your opinion

Problem 1:
The current minimum requirements for building projects that need to query the blockchain in the Cardano ecosystem usually include running cardano-node and cardano-db-sync components that take significant resources/understanding/time to set up and maintain, as well as incur high financial costs to run this base layer infrastructure if adding failover support. Moreover, as Cardano grows, these requirements are getting more and more expensive (https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/issues/2978). We anticipate that future requirements will be too high for individuals to run such large setups.
Problem 2:
At the moment, there is no standard on what certain blockchain information sets should represent and what should be included. This means that every builder is taking their own approach to querying what should be the same dataset from the blockchain. This leads to re-inventing the wheel with almost every project jumping through similar hoops for working out their queries and leads to differences in object representation between builders. For example, different explorers show different values for the ""live stake"" dataset.
 
Koios API
The Koios API (Figure 1) will be an optimized query layer that qualifies as a flexible launchpad for builders removing the overhead costs of setting up, running and maintaining Cardano components (Problem 1), as well as offering API endpoints for both simple and complex data through open-source standardised queries (Problem 2). Figure 2 provides a more technical overview of the Koios API by illustrating most of its features listed below.
 
Koios features

Elastic infrastructure that is RESTful and easily scalable horizontally by adding more Koios instances. The instances are independent and capable of forming an independent branch as long as the health checks pass.
Flexibility for consumers, giving them the option to either query the KoiosAPI remotely with no software (light mode) or run a Koios stack locally if needed. A hybrid approach is also possible, with a preference for local connection but with failover to proxy (for example, during local upgrades).
Security - the components in use will allow easy encryption/authentication/DDoS control layers and not fall into smart queries causing slowness (one of the limitations if going down the GraphQL path).
No single point of failure from three different perspectives - entity-wise, component-wise and infrastructure-wise.
Standardized queries for Cardano datasets provide an easy way to add new ones, improve or use the existing queries to build on by having all queries open-source. These also include provisioning for cached layers of queries that can be resource-intensive and are not readily available (e.g. the live stake dataset for all pools). This has two major benefits:
a) It drastically reduces the setting-up time cost for builders as they do not have to reinvent the wheel to get specific data from the blockchain (especially so for complex queries).
b) It will reduce differences in object representations between different builders and encourage a standardized approach peer-reviewed by the community.
Open-source and always open to contributions from the community. This includes not just queries for different data, but also infrastructure setup scripts, documentation, etc. Everything in Koios remains open-source!
Architecture is carefully thought-over with optimal performance, failover, decentralization and prevention of duplicated work in mind.

 
How Koios differs from other projects with similar aims
This is best shown in points 1), 4), 5), 6) and 7), but we will try to shortly summarize it here. The Koios elastic infrastructure combined with being open-source allows easy scaling and flexibility for both lightweight and heavyweight clients - it is simple for projects to configure even their own private Koios clusters. Moreover, Koios is not controlled by any centralized entity, nor does it have a single point of failure in any aspect. Finally, open-source queries and object standards will encourage knowledge sharing and unified efforts to solve problems common to all builders.

Deliverables

Setup scripts for creating complete onboarding of Koios instances with additional custom endpoints and making queries available on GitHub.
Approach and work with interested explorer/wallet providers to collaborate and unify object representations, while making these available to the community.
The first batch of data queries including all the base queries (e.g. list of registered stake pools), and the most requested complex ones (e.g. live stake distribution across pools).
A commitment for stable setup of initial core Koios instances run by the core members until we see adoption & beyond. These will ensure live data availability to serve API, and the setup will be extended horizontally by other members who wish to join the project.
Creating a set of rules for each endpoint to ensure any instance lacking in data automatically fails over to a working instance.
Providing the same query layer availability over Testnet, Mainnet and Guild (a separate 30-min epoch network for running quick tests) Networks.
Continuous maintenance and improvements to infrastructure and query layers.

 
Community Engagement
As the Cardano community represents the users of Koios, we want to hear and cater to its needs. Hence, 60-minute community meetings will be held on a bi-weekly basis open to anyone interested in the project. These will also provide a space for the core development team to report on current progress and issues, as well as open the floor to the community to give feedback, make requests, and get involved in discussions about Koios.
 
Budget
Costs for Koios can be separated into several categories:

Core instances server costs (12 months) - 4000 USD
Compensation for initial development phase (3 months) + maintenance (12 months) - 24000 USD
Community incentives (3 months) - 2000 USD

The community incentives will be used to incentivize top community collaborators on the project during the initial development phase.

INTRODUCTION
Dandelion is a Catalyst Fund5 funded proposal (find original here [0]) that aims to nurture an open network and marketplace of API deployments and as expressed in the original proposal, developing further this project will enrich the Cardano developers and operators ecosystem by providing OpenSource tools and a fault tolerant backbone for dApps and light wallets.
The first phase of the development of this network included research around the need of a reputation system that can be used by clients (dApps, light wallets...) of the network to choose between the different operators running the network.
The research being held cooperatively among the operators of the Dandelion IAN (Incentivized Alpha Network), and discussed in the public weekly meetings that take place in Gimbalabs Discord [1] every Wednesday, led us to recognise the need of developing multiple pieces of software to coordinate the different vital tasks of the nodes participating in the network.
Desired Outcome
A micro-services ecosystem of ""dandelion daemons"" [2] that enables the network to evolve to a Beta stage and uses on-chain metadata for orchestration; which will increase transactions traffic and fees given back to Cardano treasury.

DETAILED PROPOSED SOLUTION
We propose to build a team to develop multiple OpenSource micro-services that will be integrated into Dandelion main project (kustomize-dandelion [0]) to solve the current challenges we encountered:
- Node-to-Node communication and coordination
- API endpoints authorization using Cardano native assets (NFTs) as ""master key""
- On-chain reputation registry using Cardano metadata
- Requests routing/proxying/tunneling and rate-limiting
- Utility token mint, sale and distribution among the nodes
API authorization is already ongoing as part of the job done by our fellow Catalyst Fund5 winner, Giovanni Gargiulo, as part of his Metadata Challenge Fund5 [1] proposal.
His work from the Java client library [2] and the Scala implementation [3] for the API authorization mechanism will serve as baseline and will be integrated into the new micro-services ecosystem.
The rest of the work will need to be researched and developed from the scratch, including a potential SmartContract integration, for which we plan to hire a Plutus Pioneer from the Gimbalabs PPBL [4] (Plutus Project-Based Learning) program (already ongoing).
3 months goals / roadmap tentative (starting from funding date)
- Have an alpha-level implementation to solve the challenges exposed above that can be tested with testnet-ADA
- Integrate the microservices in kustomize-dandelion
- Build the continuous integration pipeline to ease the development of the microservices
- Research and develop the role of smart contracts into Dandelion ecosystem
6 months goals / roadmap tentative
- Have a beta-level implementation to solve the challenges exposed above that operators can use to start monetizing the service in mainnet
12 months goals / roadmap tentative
- Have a mature implementation that fully accomplishes the challenges exposed 
 
Costs estimates
- 2x 20h/week Senior developer familiar to microservices architecture and distributed systems (2x $3200/mo x3 months: $19200)
- 1x 20h/week Plutus developer ($3200 x3 months: $9600)
- 1x 10h/week Product Owner role ($1600 x3 months: $4800)
- $2000 bonus for team member if goals are met after the 3 months mark (4x $2000: $8000) 
 
Total estimate: $41600 for a 3 months period.

## What is Blockfrost.io?
Blockfrost.io is an instant, public and freely accessible API that removes infrastructure obstacles for developers so that everyone can start building (d)apps on Cardano. With Blockfrost.io, developers can start doing what they love ❤️, without the need for running and maintaining additional infrastructure and tooling themselves.
At the moment, we have more than 2,500 developers already onboarded in Blockfrost!
 
## What is Plutus Application Backend?
Plutus Application Backend (PAB) is a component developed by IOG, which manages contract applications run on users' machines. It handles the interactions with the node to manage the state of the wallets and tracks historical chain information. Right now, you need to run a full Cardano node to interact with PAB.
 
## Deliverables and roadmap
We would like to build a version of PAB that will, instead of having to talk to full node, interact with Blockfrost API. That way, developers building on Cardano will be able to take full advantage of PAB without having to run, maintain and monitor full node infrastructure.
We will release the first version of this software within two months after funding. This first release will be composed of a functional PAB node integration with Blockfrost API, documentation and relevant tests. We anticipate the active developement to continue into Q1 2022.

## What Unity?
Unity is a tool used by a large number of game developers to create and power their creations. Unity software is powerful, extremely easy to use and widely adopted by thousands of developers.
 
## Deliverables and roadmap
We would like to create Unity assets, that are used directly in the game development, to interact with Cardano blockchain using Blockfrost. The game developer will just drag and drop a specific asset and build the game logic around it.
An example of a game logic could be that a specific door opens only if you own a specific NFT. The game developer will just drag and drop Cardano Blockfrost asset on top of the door and specify the action to be done. All this, without the need to run any Cardano related infrastructure.

## What is an API?
API is an interface that helps developers program (d)applications effortlessly. An API is a software component that makes the developer's life a lot easier, reusing already available tools instead of reinventing the wheel.
Blockfrost.io is a hosted API, this means that developers don't have to spend time building and setting up the infrastructure needed to run their own API. Instead, developers can focus on developing applications.
 
## What is an SDK?
SDK stands for ""Software Development Kit"", which is a great way to think about it — a kit. Think about putting together a model car or plane. When constructing this model, a whole bunch of items is needed, including the kit pieces themselves, the tools needed to put them together, assembly instructions, and so forth.
An SDK functions in much the same way, providing a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes, and/or guides that allow developers to create software applications on a specific platform. If an API is a set of building blocks that allow for creating something, an SDK is a full-fledged workshop, facilitating creation far outside the scopes of what an API would allow.
 
## Roadmap, deliverables and performance
We plan to deliver the first stable version of the SDK within two months from the funding.
The first version will include 100% coverage of all Blockfrost API endpoints in Dark, including tests and documentation. We will continue working and maintaining the SDK for a year.
The main key performance indicator (KPI) is a little bit tricky as there is not a good way to track the usage of Dark packages. Our short-term goal is to have at least 10 projects use our SDK 6 months after the release.

We pay our people well because they are both skilled and exceptionally experienced in the industry. And last but not least, because we respect them and want them to feel good and appreciated while working on Cardano.

Problem Summary
DBSync data is highly normalized and hard to analyze or apply Machine Learning in its raw state.
Our Solution
Our plan is to build an open-source analytics-ready dataset of Cardano on-chain data which provides the community with an analytics-ready dataset of the Cardano blockchain.
The core data source will be Cardano DB-Sync, and the deliverable will be a Github repository of SQL views which create datasets to enable developers and data scientists to answer questions such as:

How is transaction volume increasing over time?
What are the transaction fees being paid to the network
How much ada is moving around the network
How is money consolidating or distributing amongst wallets
How maybe ppl are delegating

Deliverables
The output of this project would be an open-source Github repository containing data integration scripts and SQL Queries as well as associated schema documentation.
Additionally, if the Cardano Data Hub idea ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Analytics-Data-Hub/368258-48088 ) gets funded, this dataset will be integrated as one of the available datasets there.
Project Plan and Budget
The project will have 4 components:
Data Discovery and community requirement gathering - $1,200

Detailed data review and profiling of db-sync
Collaboration with community on requirements

Data Modelling - $1,200

Modelling datasets based on available data and community input

SQL Development - $1,575

Develop SQL views to aggregate and implement modelled data

Documentation - $600

Provide schema and user documentation for consumers and implementers of the data

Total Budget - $4,575
 
Budgets are based on a $75/h USD hourly rate. No funds are being requested for infrastructure costs or development tools.
Expected completion date would be 6-8 weeks after funding is received.

A blockchain in itself is the persistent storage of the state of the ledger. Each block of the blockchain contains the logs of the operations applied to the ledger at a given point in time. If you attempt to take a look at the blockchain in its entirety, you would only see a consistent immutable line that expands infinitely forward. This is the case because the blockchain is designed to be an indefinitely growing succession of blocks. As I write this document there are about 700 thousands blocks in Bitcoin's blockchain and about 6 millions blocks in Cardano's.
However, as you start zooming toward the head of the blockchain you will begin seeing the blockchain grow. This is where history is being written, where the exciting part is happening. Most of us as users of blockchains will be most interested in what is happening here, wherein new changes to the distributed ledger are being applied. Depending on the way the active participants are cooperating to maintain the distributed ledger (depending on the consensus algorithm) the head of the blockchain may look more or less broad, more or less messy. Branches may appear, sometimes short lived ones, and sometimes seemingly at random. Every blockchain protocol aims to have them be short lived, but sometimes they may persist for longer than preferred or expected. We have already seen explicit forks happen on other blockchains which have taken on a life of their own and built out their own ecosystem. These are competitive snapshots of the ledger and hopefully the blockchain protocol will help resolve these fairly quickly.
From a user perspective, these competitive variants of the timeline are not necessarily relevant. Often these snapshots will intersect in the changes they are applying to the ledger, with some transactions potentially even appearing in both variations (though this is not always the case). With these competing variants continuing forward, eventually the blockchain may operate what is referred to as a rollback. In essence a rollback is the blockchain simply ""changing its mind"" (based on predefined rules) about which variant is the preferred one.
 
 The Multiverse is an innovative approach to reading and representing the state of blockchains. It provides nodes a competitive edge by maintaining and eventually participating in the various branches of a chain. This has waterfall effects through the entire stack, wherein various pieces of core ecosystem tooling such as blockchain explorers will be able to benefit significantly as well. Lastly, this also translates to a better end user experience, which we will cover in addressing how user wallets can maintain state via the Multiverse data structure directly.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


At Gimbalabs, we are pioneering the work of onboarding ""experienced developers who are new to blockchain"" to the Cardano ecosystem. Since our founding during Fund 2 of Project Catalyst, we have:
- developed open source tools like Dandelion APIs and CardanoSharp libraries to support devs to build on & tinker with Cardano, 
- created education materials like Coding on Chain and Gimbalabs Playground sessions for devs and other builders to learn what's possible on Cardano
- piloted live, project-based learning experiences where devs who are new to blockchain can work together to wrap their minds around the new implications of building on distributed and decentralized platforms
- fostered opportunities for new and experienced developers to collaborate on real projects
- supported dozens of projects within Catalyst and beyond to start to bring their ideas to life
All of this we've done by asking developers to volunteer their time and energy in hopes of an eventual payoff. With this proposal, we seek the approval of the Catalyst Community to facilitate the next phase of our work by supporting four developers to commit full-time to Cardano development at the dawn of the Alonzo era.
---
This proposal addresses the Developer Ecosystem Challenge from two angles:
Growing expertise: we will directly increase the number of developers actively building on Cardano. In our work already, we are onboarding talented developers who want to understand more about blockchain in general, and Cardano in particular. We've worked hard already to ""show"" these devs how building on blockchain is different: what old rules still apply, and which are thrown out the window. For example, what is the role of a centralized database in a decentralized app? How can we handle user authentication using metadata and/or decentralized identity?
Creating tools and documentation for developers: in addition to the developers we train directly, we will create tools and documentation so that others can engage more deeply and build on Cardano. We are focused on primitive components that can be applied to many use cases: authentication, storage, digital rights management, tokens with real utility like event tickets, proofs of donation, and more. This is not an exhaustive list, just a sampling of what we've been working on. As we continue to build these tools we will release documentation and learning resources so that additional devs can build specific use cases.
---
What is challenging about this work is that each of our concerns depends on another:
In order to build end use cases, we need to have new tooling and people who understand those tools.
In order to understand what tooling we need, we must have end use cases in mind and people who understand the design problems we're solving.
In order to build dapps and tooling, we need people who are not only technically savvy, but also deeply understand the system of big ideas, technical and otherwise, underlying Cardano's implementation.
In order to attract these developers, we need to be able to provide clarity about what they're building in the first place, even as the Cardano platform continues to roll out.
On top of this dynamic array of concerns, we recognize that talented developers are valuable and command high salaries wherever they choose to go. We already have the experience of onboarding two very talented developers who have been unable to stick around because they need the assurance the new full-time jobs they were offered while working with us. That's why we're writing this proposal. 100% of the budget of this proposal is for developers, and represents an investment in the long-term health of Gimbalabs and the Cardano developer community.
---
It will be  hard to overstate how much work is coming our way as the full functionality of Cardano goes online, and our global community needs more people who are prepared to do it. Our goal is to have a team in place before that happens, and we think that it's essential to build that team by growing the overall pool of Cardano developers.
Plan:
Use the funds for this proposal to pay 2 developers a full-time salary for four months of full-time work
Devs will focus on creating well-documented tools and example use cases so that more people can continue to learn what Cardano can do
Our intention is for these developers to become leaders in Cardano blockchain development who can in turn support more devs to come aboard
--- For Example ---
In the current work of the ""Gimbalabs Playground"", we are diving into a series of development questions. One such question is, ""How can we use metadata, native assets, smart contracts, and decentralized storage to create an event ticketing service?"" As you can imagine, there are all sorts of smaller, focused questions that emerge from this big one. In the shared work of answering it, we are creating tools that will apply to a variety of use cases, and we are piloting several of those use cases. Even more importantly, we are building a community of experts who will be able to support others to use these tools. If funded, this proposal will directly support the growth of expertise in our community. We will continue to deliver the tools, accompanying documentation, and in-person opportunities to engage with our development team.
--- Summary ---
We will continue to build and refine the ""Gimbalabs Playground"" process for experiential, project-based learning into a product that will help organizations of all sizes to join us in the Alonzo era.
There's work to do, we have people to do it, and we'd like to pay them to do so. During the Refinement Phase, please let us know in the comments what else you'd want us to deliver, and we will incorporate that into these plans.
--- Budget ---
Total of $54,000 USD
$27,000 each for two developers to commit to 4 months of full-time development work.
--- Success Metrics ---
3 Months: Both developers are up to speed on how to build Dapps and tooling on Cardano, and have contributed to open source tooling and documentation.
6 Months: Our initial work was engaging enough to keep these developers around and the resulting tools are being used by additional devs across the Cardano ecosystem
12 Months: These Catalyst-sponsored developers are leading teams and continuing to onboard newcomers to the Cardano developer community. The tools they've created are being used in production Dapps worldwide.
 
--- Selection process of Developers ---
We are already piloting this program with the first four developers on our Plutus Project-Based Learning (PPBL) team, which launched in August 2021. Here is the application form: https://form.typeform.com/to/ELjAlMnV
We are hosting ""PPBL Office Hours"" for anyone in the community every Wednesday at 3:30pm UTC in the Gimbalabs Discord server.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We are building a system that picks up where Plutus Pioneers leaves off by:
1. Creating a space where anyone can develop a deeper understanding and get better at building with Plutus.
2. Building an example of a repository of reusable, open source Plutus components (Apache 2.0 License) that will benefit the Cardano community.
3. Practice working together as Gimbalabs begins to take on commercial opportunities.
The Plutus PBLearning Journey comprises a two-fold approach: on the one hand our team is providing guidance and learning opportunities through a weekly learning path, comprises by: 30 minute weekly retro, 60 min weekly open office hours and 2 hours weekly co-development sessions. the scope of monthly work is outlined in our gitlab repository (see link below). Furthermore, the Plutus team is taking on responsibility of creating the scope of each successive month - an approach that is taking into account the self-determination and passions each team member wants to focus on - enriching that way the learning opportunity. On the other hand, we will offer the Plutus cohort to ""learn by doing"" by working on actual projects for Cardano Startups and Cardano-adopting companies, which will give them the ""real world experience"" they need to level up. This project-based learning consumes a full time working assignment for 4 months.
The selection of developers: we launched a application form to identify motivated candidates, please see this form here: form: https://form.typeform.com/to/ELjAlMnV. As of to date we started the first pilot programm with our first four Plutus pioneers (launched August 2021) 
Stated above represents the roadmap for a 4 month program including deliverables that serve the cardano developer community (documentation), Cardano-adopting companies (Plutus capacity building for own operations/products), as well as provides an entry point for developers becoming Plutus devs building up credentials, establish a network as well as access and develop commercial opportunities. This proposal contributes to make it easier for developers to build on top of Cardano by increasing the number of developers actively building on top of Cardano (+4), number open source Plutus components produced (15).
Budget is considering to fund two more Plutus developers for 4 months with:
- Base funding of $3000/month
- Monthly bonus for achieving all goals: $2500
-- Total $22000 for 4 months
Gimbalabs forward looking plan (3,6,12 months) is to further expand the onboarding of Plutus developers under this learning program and at the same time enlarging the network of companies in need of their services, envisioning this system being self-sustaining and a platform of supply and demand, by serving the needs of both our Plutus developers and Cardano-adopting companies.
We thought through possible risk factors that hinder the project to be successful. The ones we are in controls are the guiding team, James & Roberto. Since they are the founder of gimbalabs, who believe in the vision and mission of gimbalabs and Cardano, it is very unlikely them leaving this project. Another possible risk is not finding suitable Plutus candidates, that as well is very unlikely since we already piloting this program with 4 highly engaged Plutus developers. The third major risk is not finding Cardano-adopting companies/startups. We are already working on a pipeline of commercial opportunities with both companies and Cardano start ups to pipeline projects to our Plutus PBL program.

We are Gimbalabs (www.gimbalabs.com), and since launching our project during Catalyst Fund 2, our aspirations have not changed. Our mission is to mobilize everyone in the Cardano community by creating tools and real-world use cases that ignite the public imagination and facilitate adoption. We envision a world where as many people as possible are empowered to solve problems using the Cardano platform.
You can see our funded Fund 2 proposal here: https://gimbalabs.com/fund2.pdf. Over the last months, we've had the opportunity to implement what we promised and test our ideas. We have seen how Dandelion APIs support developers, leading to new collaborations. We have engaged with over 30 new and experienced developers, who are learning about Cardano, tinkering with tools, and already launching collaborative projects. Now our focus turns to the organizational structure of our growing network.
Fund 6 focus: developer experience and bridging to real world application
Each day, we connect with developers, entrepreneurs, and Cardano enthusiasts who want to build on Cardano. We are piloting intro development courses, creating collaborative structures that support new leaders to emerge, and testing processes for establishing teams.
Based on what we've experienced and feedback received from our work over the last eight weeks, we know that refining our organizational structure is essential. We must provide clarity about what Gimbalabs is, and the opportunities it provides. This Fund 6 proposal sharpens our focus through the lens of the developer experience. Over the next three months, we will continue to share tools and learning resources across the Cardano community, with a special focus on contributing to Catalyst, namely a project pipeline that drives the creation of new proposals, facilitates the formation of teams, and expands the Gimbalabs open-source toolbox for developers.
 
HOW we build future network developer capacity
Our value proposition is to provide a unique developer experience through meaningful engagement with the Cardano ecosystem. We want to make sure that developers identify a space that provides opportunities to learn, tinker (incubate ideas) as well as participate (engaging in real projects). In detail this developer experience journey comprises the following:
1: Experimentation with both software and collaboration processes, allowing developers to start learning, to bring in ideas and to get help incubating projects. We want developers to explore as well as to participate and commit to a defined project by creating applications that help solve problems and address business needs or opportunities.
Developer training: the next round of Cardano Starter Kits are developer-focused and are rolling out presently. We are taking what we've learned by piloting ""Intro to Development"" and by gathering experienced developers who are new to Cardano.
Gimbalabs Initiatives: We are running a series of experiments in how to build flexible teams that can achieve specific goals. These ""mini-projects"" are helping to cultivate additional leaders within the Gimbalabs community, as well providing ways for devs and non-devs to collaborate.
Gimbalabs Playground: The success of the experiments listed above can be judged by the number of developers we've helped to engage with Cardano, and we are happy to report that devs are showing up. One of our key priorities over the next few months is to team up with these developers to launch a series of ""Playground"" projects: open-source tools that pave the way for real-world utility. The first such project is underway, and we're looking forward to sharing more over the next few weeks.
With these formats we foster engagement among developers and create a direct impact on their knowledge, capability creation as well as forming teams to engage in more complex ventures where multi-disciplinarity is required, such as: infrastructure, front-end, back-end, UX design and agile project management.
2: Open-source toolbox for Developers allows ownership of infrastructure, facilitates access and leverage on any tools to explore ideas truly. Our toolbox is always evolving through those tools that were/will be created during the experimentation process mentioned above.
Cardano APIs as Community Service (aka Dandelions): serve as entry-points for developers by offering open, free hosted vanilla flavour of currently available Cardano interfaces for new adopters to explore ideas and launch proofs of concept for new projects. These public, free services will ease adoption of Cardano by providing infrastructure for initial setup and testing of ideas, therefore encouraging developers to start building by reducing the time invested from days to minutes.
Startup OSS deployments: We aim to maximize autonomy by hosting our own instances of OpenSource services when possible (and we'll use hosted OSS when it's not so we also directly support their projects) and we'd like to facilitate this task so that anyone who wants to host their own ""dandelions"" is supported to do so.
Gimbalabs Playground: Everything we create in our playground experiments (as described above) will become part of the open-source toolbox hosted at gimbalabs.com.
3: Cardano Starter Kits (CSKs) apply principles of Project Based Learning in order to build capabilities required to take the next step to become a Cardano Developer. Over the next 6-12 months, we will roll out CSKs that put Cardano in the hands of the general public. In order to achieve this, our focus for the next 3 months is developer onboarding. The CSKs rolling out presently will therefore be developer-focused, with entry-points and next steps for anyone learning to code, and quick overviews of where to start for experienced developers.
4: The Gimbalabs platform will consolidate all mentioned above in one single source, with the aim to offer the needed space to developers to start the Cardano journey. We have the objective to create an engaged and committed network of developers that is known as a place to go to where true experimentation is taking place.
Gimbalabs provides an opportunity to expose developers' work and talent profile as being a part of a decentralized consulting team. It also provides start-ups, Catalyst proposal teams, companies and institutions with the tools and support they need to build upon Cardano.
Beyond the developer experience: Gimbalabs path to a self-sustaining DAO
With this proposal, we focus on the next three months of intensive developer training and resource creation. Our pathway to long-term sustainability is unchanged. We conclude that this developer experience will enable a revenue driven business by providing consulting through a decentralized pool of talented builders and skillful leaders, equipped to help companies and institutions to build on Cardano. This might start by providing a customized workshop to introduce to the Cardano blockchain, guide a process of incubation and exploring, to implement a defined application including educational marketing to accompany the go-to-market strategy.
In summary we have explored the idea that Gimbalabs might be a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The ""decentralized"" part is a work in progress, and we prioritize the autonomy of everyone who contributes to projects. Over the next three months, our work will focus on the ""organization"" part: how can we provide enough structure so that everyone feels a sense of clarity about what Gimbalabs is and how it works, while also maintaining a high level of decentralized autonomy?
The Gimbalabs Leadership Team
As the core leadership team of Gimbalabs, we are creating synergies across our competencies by delivering within our roles and contributing big ideas to shared outcomes.

Overall
Cardano is working towards realizing our vision of creating a decentralized, fair and smart society through blockchain technology.
How will blockchain become useful to society?
Assuming the need to ensure scalability and sustainability, blockchain is providing a means to solve various social issues by adding value to and preserving data through functions such as NFT and smart contracts, in addition to ADA (as a cryptocurrency).
Blockchain-compatible CPUs for IOT aims to help maximize the advantages of blockchain when it comes into use in an increasingly digital society.
Because it can be expanded by blockchain-optimized CPUs for IOT.
If the reliability of the data is not ensured (relying on the trust of the organization or person handling the data), it becomes inefficient or impossible to determine the authenticity of the data.
""Authentic data,"" which is a requirement for the establishment of smart contracts, can be provided for Oracle, the scenes in which it can be used will expand.  Then, we will create an environment for data and token economy.
 
We plan to proceed in phases with the part where we can demonstrate the case.
This budget has been prepared for Phase 1 below.

As the Cardano ecosystem grows, loosely formed global teams are emerging. These teams will form treasuries that need to be managed and leveraged in a trustless and scalable way. We are already seeing this within the Catalyst ecosystem where collaboration is championed. Catalyst Swarm, Catalyst School, and the Eastern Townhall are examples of this. These teams are inspired to solve vexing problems that are either technical in nature or address real-world problems or both. It is however a challenge to fund innovative public good production.
Catalyst's Grant funding model will not scale well. Funding innovation and science are notoriously difficult. Outcomes are difficult to measure, are uncertain, and don't have market prices to help guide investment. As Project Catalyst grows it will become more difficult to directly manage the influx of proposals and funded projects. Grant programmes and direct democracy do not scale globally.
Enabling rich and fast experimentation with emergent teams and treasuries- Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)- will enable Cardano to innovate rapidly. We need to build reusable components to let that experimentation happen. 
Team & Experience
The team has experience in financial markets software engineering, cryptocurrency payments, tech start-ups, Data & Govtech, impact investing. We are also active in organising a legal-tech community and the Eastern Townhall.
Robert O'Brien: Distributed Systems Software Engineer (Financial Systems) and Entrepreneur. Co-Founded three start-ups in Financial Data Analytics, International Trade Payments, and Impact Investing. Co-organises LegalHackers New Zealand, and advises a Social Entrepreneurship Incubator. Co-Initiator of the Eastern Town Hall.
Andrew Walker: Distributed Systems Software Engineer, mostly in the financial sector in the City of London. Worked at Barclays Capital (credit risk) and LIFFE (derivatives exchange). Working on cryptocurrency payments infrastructure and also experienced with the hospitality sector.
We are Plutus Pioneers (Cohort 1). The team (and our extended network) has experience in User Experience design, used formal methods, and developed high-performance systems in financial settings. Over the last thirty years, we've worked on highly concurrent distributed systems using C/C++ and functional languages OCaml, Erlang, Scala, and Haskell. We have experience in Blockchains and cryptocurrency projects.  
Our Solution
Risk-Adjusted Bonding Plutus Software Development Kit (SDK). We will design and engineer a module of baseline Smart Contracts for implementing Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curves.
We will design and engineer a reusable Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curve(RABC) [1][6][12] module and SDK. An open-source reusable module in Plutus utilising the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) architecture. Robust and general enough to be used across many applications; Reliably incorporated into DApps and Treasury Management processes. There will be no need to keep reinventing the same components.
Layered over the module will be a Software Developers Kit (SDK) to enable easy integration with DApps used in DAOs. A System Dynamics modelling toolkit, using cadCAD[2], will help project teams decide on configurations and set parameters for their contract deployments.
An RABC[6] implements a type of Impact Bond[3]. A performance-oriented investment instrument suitable for retroactive project funding. Funding projects with highly uncertain outcomes when they succeed. Leveraging treasury funds by only paying out when results are achieved. RABC have been researched and developed as impact finance instruments[12], yet the design is applicable to new or innovative project scenarios: social or environmental change, science, early-stage and seed-stage technology start-ups, internal corporate project budgeting, DAO coordination, leveraged community grants, art, and public good production.
Vitalk Buterin recently gave a talk[4] about the future of Etherum that focused heavily on the problems addressed by the RABC mechanism. The mechanism design and economic system dynamics have been extensively researched for the retroactive funding use case. The work is presented by Blockscience[10] as a dynamic technical report containing executable simulation. See: https://github.com/BlockScience/Risk-Adjusted-Bonding-Curves
A EUTXO Specific Architecture
The module and Smart Contract design will be engineered specifically for the EUTXO architecture of the Cardano Blockchain. The core design will utilise a batch auction mechanism to maximise transaction throughput and prevent resource contention on the underlying reserves (liquidity pools). The design is based on the Treynor Dealer model[7]. A design that combines an order book (Dealer) as a periodic combinatorial auction with an AMM liquidity pool, scaling transaction throughput.
The combinatorial auction is not your typical English Auction! It is an off-chain optimising algorithm designed to maximise welfare (a fair price for all participants). A single Plutus-Backend node can execute it, or run as an *Oracle Pool* when more complex higher-throughput matching requirements are needed.
The underlying bonding curves, and therefore the composite RABC, can be parameterised to suit specific periodic settlement windows (per-slot, epoch, or other) and throughput requirements. In addition to curve specific parameters, the RABC can be configured with different Alpha parameter sources including a signal source from an Oracle, or via a prediction market.
Please refer to our Catalyst Fund 2 Proposal for more details about Combinatorial Auctions and Oracle Pools[7], and our Catalyst Fund 5 proposal[8] and the economic specification[6] of RABCs for more details on them, their composite, and their use.
To design and build the Risk-Adjusted bonding curve module we are using, as a reference, the Comos Bond Module[5]; Heavily leveraging the economic specification[6] and system dynamics work already done by Shruti Appiah[11][1] & Blockscience[10]. As the project gets underway we will welcome other interested contributors from the community to help build and maintain the project.
Impact on Challenge Metrics
DApps for DeFi, SoFi (Social and Environment Finance), and RealFi can be built from standard building blocks. Many aspects of project funding, team accounting and compensation systems are similar. There is no need to keep reinventing the same components.
The RABC module aims to be an essential toolkit for software developers that don't want to dive into learning Haskell, EUTXO, PlutusTx or the Plutus Application Backend. An essential toolkit for technology start-ups that don't have the skills in complexity-science and engineering talent to develop great economic protocols.
By focusing on primitives and engineering for reuse across the Cardano Ecosystem, we can make it faster to deploy reliable market-focused DApps. DApp developers can easily integrate and interoperate modular Smart Contract mechanisms that we develop, giving customers confidence that their wealth is secure and value streams are fair.
Key Performance Indicators
Key Metric: Project Velocity[8], defined as a combination of base activity metrics of commits pulled from Github.
Activity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence of deliverables and engineering milestones achieved.
Community Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories[9] for the Bond Module, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem. These Metrics derive mostly from Github.
What Success Looks Like
Our proposal will contribute to Cardano's developer ecosystem a module for Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curve explicitly designed for the EUTXO architecture using Plutus. The module is intended for integration into other higher-level protocols and DApps.
After One Month:

Initial specifications and scope for RABC module completed.

After Six Months:

Completed design for the module and implementation of the core protocols running on testnets.
Documentation published that both explains the design and use of the RABC.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Having shown the feasibility of writing Cardano clients in Flutter in Fund 5, the goal of Fund 6 will be to complete the library, publish tutorials and support the budding community.
What is Flutter Again?
Flutter is a Google-backed, cross-platform mobile development environment that generates native apps for both iOS and Android. Recently, web app support was added (see this projects live demo wallet: https://flutter-cardano-wallet.web.app/)) and Flutter will soon support desktop apps. Other Flutter strengths are fast, fluid, pixel-perfect user interfaces, rapid prototyping, excellent developer tooling and a modern, user-friendly, strongly-typed programming language.
Fund 5 Recap
The Fund 5 work established Dart, the programming language of Flutter, to be a first class development environment for writing Cardano clients. Unlike many other Cardano software development kits (SDKs), the Flutter Wallet SDK is written in pure Dart which guarantees this complex cryptographic code will work seamlessly on all of Flutter's supported platforms: iOS, Android, web and desktop. The Fund 5 work targeted a few critical use-cases, but was, by design a proof-of-concept prototype, leaving out such key features as native tokens, NFTs, staking and smart contracts.
Fund 6 Overview
A Fund 6 grant would result in a full-featured Cardano SDK for the Flutter developer community, along with the educational resources to fast-track onboarding. The budget covers 500 hours of full-time development over the next four months in three broad areas:

Finish SDK (410 hours) - Deliver a complete, professional, high-level SDK. As detailed below under SDK Task Breakdown, there is much work to be accomplished, but the highlight will be smart contract support. Clear documentation and use-case examples will be emphasized, along with good test coverage to ensure high-quality, high-reliability code.
Publish Tutorials (80 hours) - An important component in on-boarding developers is the availability of high-quality tutorials. This would entail writing and publishing Flutter demonstration apps, writing step-by-step tutorial articles around each app and, time allowing, video tutorials. Likely topics would include: loading and displaying wallet balances, building and sending a transactions, minting native tokens or NFTs and connecting to and running smart contracts.
Community Support (10 hours) - Answering questions, sharing coding insights, explaining design decisions and responding to feature requests can be time consuming, but is important for community building.

SDK Task Breakdown (410 hours)
The primary project directive remains to produce a high-level SDK that enables developers to focus on their business idea and not the low-level details of the Cardano blockchain.
Areas of focus will be:

Smart contracts (100 hours). - This will focus on basic handling, verification and signing of smart contracts. At least two common use-cases will be provided as hand-written samples. Lastly, tooling for off-chain code generation will be explored.
Persistence (40 hours) - The majority of professional applications require a persistence layer to provide good user experiences. This built-in persistence module will allow restoration of wallet state (even when off-line), faster updating when on-line and possible API extensions. Time allowing, non-blockchain data storage like NTF image caching and saving wallet metadata, will be implemented.
Native Token/NFT (25 hours) - Provide minting and burning support for Native Tokens and NFTs.
Staking (25 hours) - Provide stake pool ranking and stake delegation support.
Mithril Ready (30 hours) - With the Mithril project, IOHK is laying the groundwork for lightweight Cardano clients to have first-class, blockchain access without the overhead of running a full node. To future-proof this SDK, its architecture will be generalized to adapt to any blockchain communication technology, including Blockfrost, GraphQL, Ogmios and inevitably Mithril.
Secure storage (20 hours) - Provide a cross-platform, encrypted storage solution for private keys and passwords.
Multi-signature Support (20 hours) - Support multi-party signatures on scripts and contracts.
Alternate Addresses (20 hours) - Support Enterprise and Pointer addresses, in addition to legacy Daedalus, Yori and other address schemes.
Hardware wallets (20 hours) - Design private key signing architecture to allow delegation to hardware wallets and support at least one popular real-world wallet.
DApp Linking (20 hours) - Chrome browser extension version to allow wallet-DApp communication, hopefully by leveraging the fruits of the Fund 5 Cardano Connector (Metamask-like) project.
API clean-up (20 hours) - Designing good APIs is hard. In addition to refactoring for clarity, this task would standardize the model and service interface patterns, as well as, reduce third-party dependencies.
Use-case examples (20 hours) - Document common use-cases with clear, concise code examples.
Test coverage (20 hours) - Plug holes in test coverage.
Misc. Coding (10 hours) - Clean-up some Fund 5 technical debt like making sure lovelace is stored using BigInt types and separating the integration and unit tests.
Code audit (10 hours) - Identify know crypto exploits and rectify. Explore security review options.
User-requested Features (10 hours) - Reserve some time for adding features requested by users.

Deliverables

Cardano Wallet SDK - https://pub.dev/packages/cardano_wallet_sdk  - Building on Fund 5 proof-of-concept foundation, a complete Cardano client SDK will be the primary deliverable of Fund 6.
BlockFrost API - https://pub.dev/packages/blockfrost  - This Fund 5 artifact will be updated as needed to support Alonzo features.
Tutorials - Demo apps will be published on GitHub.com, written tutorials on medium.com and video tutorials on YouTube.com.
Demo Wallet - https://flutter-cardano-wallet.web.app -  This live demo app will be updated as time allows to demonstrate the SDK in action. This is a closed-source project and development time will not be billed to this Catalyst F6 project.

Who is this guy?
Watch the Fund5 interview if your curious about my background and would like more insight into this project:  https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/fund/f5/challenge/25939/proposals/352623 
Roadmap and Performance
Fund 5 work will be completed before the Fund 6 start date: 11/1/2021. Code will be continually pushed to GitHub and the corresponding pub.dev package repository throughout the duration of the project. Catalyst Fund 6 work should be completed four months after the start date. Future work will be driven by community interest and developer adaption.
Internally, performance will be measured by passing unit tests for the promised features. Externally, the primary performance indicator (KPI) will be adoption as indicated by the popularity percentage on pub.dev. For any of the timelines (3, 6 and 12 months), anything over 10% indicates significant usage. At publication date, F5 blockfrost is already at 46% and the F5 cardano_wallet_sdk is at 26%, incredible for a half-finished project. I expect these numbers to spike once the tutorials roll out.
Budget
I felt very honored to be funded in F5, but underestimated the development time by a factor of 4. Attempting to be more realistic in Fund 6, I'm requesting 500 hours and a $30,000 budget (full breakdown is in the write-up above). This will provide a living wage, while I work full-time on the SDK over the next four months. To reduce costs and keep ROI high, I've lowered my rate from $100/hour to $60/hour.

DApp developers working on market opportunities need to move fast and test their market, iterating quickly on designs and approaches. These DApps often require market mechanisms that help fund projects and incentivise user activity.
These underlying Smart Contracts will carry significant value and require customer trust. Customers need to know that the protocols are well engineered and of high assurance. However, developing robust, scalable, modular and composable Plutus Smart Contracts requires formal analysis, design and engineering across many disciplines including software engineering, finance, economics, and complexity science. Many DApp development teams lack these skills.
Team & Experience
The team has experience in financial markets software engineering, cryptocurrency payments, tech start-ups, Data & Govtech, impact investing. We are also active in organising a legal-tech community and the Eastern Townhall.
Robert O'Brien: Distributed Systems Software Engineer (Financial Systems) and Entrepreneur. Co-Founded three start-ups in Financial Data Analytics, International Trade Payments, and Impact Investing. Co-organises LegalHackers New Zealand, and advises a Social Entrepreneurship Incubator. Co-Initiator of the Eastern Town Hall.
Andrew Walker: Distributed Systems Software Engineer, mostly in the financial sector in the City of London. Worked at Barclays Capital (credit risk) and LIFFE (derivatives exchange). Working on cryptocurrency payments infrastructure and also experienced with the hospitality sector.
We are Plutus Pioneers (Cohort 1). The team (and our extended network) has experience in User Experience design, used formal methods, and developed high-performance systems in financial settings. Over the last thirty years, we've worked on highly concurrent distributed systems using C/C++ and functional languages OCaml, Erlang, Scala, and Haskell. We have experience in Blockchains and cryptocurrency projects.
Our Solution
A Bonding Curve Plutus Software Development Kit (SDK). We will design and engineer a module of baseline Smart Contracts for implementing Automated Market Makers (AMM) and more.
We will build an open-source, reusable module in Plutus utilising the Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTxO) architecture. It will be general enough for use in many applications and will be reliably incorporated into more complex Plutus designs. Layered over that will be a Software Developers Kit (SDK) to enable easy integration with DApps.
Bonding Curves[1] are one of the most useful and widely used components in DeFi. They are used in AMMs that underpin many of the Decentralised Exchanges (DEX), Loan, and Insurance protocols popular in DeFi. Their applicability extends beyond the limited scope of DeFi, including many different scenarios for Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) governance, project funding, fractional ownership of NFTs etc.
An EUTXO Specific Architecture
The module and Smart Contract design will be engineered specifically for the EUTXO architecture of the Cardano Blockchain. The core design will utilise a batch auction mechanism to maximise throughput and prevent resource contention on the underlying reserve (liquidity pool). The design is based on the Treynor Dealer model[13]. A design that combines an order book (Dealer) as a periodic combinatorial auction with an AMM liquidity pool.
The combinatorial auction is not your typical English Auction! It is an off-chain optimising algorithm designed to maximise welfare (a fair price for all participants). A single Plutus-Backend node can execute it, or run as an Oracle Pool when more complex higher-throughput matching requirements are needed.
Bonding Curves can be parameterised to suit specific periodic settlement windows (per-slot, epoch, or other), throughput requirements, shared reserve pool, and transaction matching using metadata. A simple bidding language for more complex matching scenarios is envisaged; Allowing a form of token-based if-then-that logic which is particularly relevant to the composition of bonding curves.
Please refer to our Catalyst Fund 2 Proposal for more details about Combinatorial Auctions and Oracle Pools[2], and our Catalyst Fund 5 proposal[3] for more details on Bonding Curves and their use.
To design and build the Bonding Curve module and SDK, we are using as a reference the Comos Bond Module[4]; leveraging the economic and system dynamics work already done by Blockscience[5], the Token Engineering[6] community, and Shruti Appiah[7]. As the project gets underway, we will welcome other interested contributors from the community to help build and maintain the project.
Impact on Challenge Metrics
DApps for DeFi, SoFi (Social Finance), and RealFi can be built from these standard building blocks. Many aspects of project funding, team accounting and compensation systems are similar. There is no need to keep reinventing the same components.
The bonding-curve module aims to be an essential toolkit for software developers that don't want to dive into learning Haskell, EUTXO, PlutusTx or the Plutus Application Backend. An essential toolkit for technology start-ups that don't have the skills in complexity-science and engineering talent to develop great economic protocols.
By focusing on baseline primitives and engineering for reuse across the Cardano Ecosystem, we can make it faster to deploy reliable market-focused DApps. DApp developers can easily integrate and interoperate modular Smart Contract mechanisms that we develop, giving customers confidence that their wealth is secure and value streams are fair.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Problem
Understanding existing smart contract protocols is tough.
Unlike smart contracts written in Solidity that resemble traditional API invocations, smart contract protocols in Cardano look more like event driven architectures where each transaction represents a transition of the underlying state. Without a sherpa to guide understanding, trying to make sense of what a protocol is doing from the mountain of transactions it generates is a significant undertaking.
In the early days of the web, the ability to view-source was that Sherpa. Developers could look at a web page and understand the code that generated that page simply by viewing the source. Want to understand how that cool page did something? View source.
This tool hopes to be that Sherpa. The tool will allow developers to look at the blockchain and understand how protocols are working and then to design new protocols of their own and share their ideas with others.
Communicating a new protocol can be just as tough
Smart contract protocols begin with the team writing a lite paper or a white paper, outlining the flow and goals of the project. Going from a lite paper or white paper to communicating with a team that spans across diverse skills and backgrounds, keeping everyone on the same page, is a challenge.
Teams also need ways to communicate their projects with outside parties such as investors and auditors. Auditors are already very expensive, so concise, consistent, and coherent communication is essential to smooth out that process. A misunderstanding can cost a company a lot in terms of both money and time.
Currently, every team has created their own way of communicating their protocols with each other and to outside parties, and each time someone new is brought up to speed teams have to teach their style of communication on top of their protocols. A common format can smooth out and speed up this process.
Debugging can feel like navigating a maze
Current tools for navigating the Cardano blockchain are difficult to set up for private blockchains. In order for developers to watch their transactions on their private test networks, there are a litany of tools they have to incorporate to crack open the black box of smart contracts.
Smart contracts on the Cardano network will use NFTs as ""passports"", leveraging the certified uniqueness of the NFT to ensure that the UTXO entering the smart contract's transaction cascade is the correct one, protecting against adversaries from interfering and stealing the funds. (For a more detailed description of how NFTs can protect against bad actors, please refer to the following article.)
https://medium.com/dcspark/every-eutxo-dapp-will-use-nfts-and-heres-why-fd87e6a8c9a6
There are currently no tools that can follow these tokens along smart contracts, essentially creating a black box scenario for developers to have to debug based solely on whether their test transactions are successful or not.
 
Proposed Solution
Discover smart contracts on the blockchain
As both a desktop program and a web app, will distill down transaction and protocol information into a visual, graphical representation of how funds flow between UTXOs and transactions. It will be able to graphically lay out the myriad of transactions that make up a smart contract protocol so that it is easier to understand at a glance. Using the app, a person will be able to ""walk"" the blockchain, following the flow of ADA through various transactions.
The user will be able to select a UTXO or transaction, referred to as a ""node"", and see all the relevant information about the node displayed on a properties pop-up. Then, using arrow keys, mouse, or touch depending on the platform, the user can traverse the graph and auto populate the graph in the direction the user takes.
Related transactions, such as those part of a smart contract protocol, can be labelled or color coded for easy identification.
Design new smart contracts
In design mode, teams will be able to visually lay out their smart contracts, including how tokens will be handled and passed along the various transaction routes. Users will be able to create an interactive experience for their teams and outside parties, allowing for easier communication around their specific goals instead of wasting time trying to understand the protocols.
A unified form of communication will allow more teams to collaborate and bring this technology to areas beyond the tech sector. Simplifying smart contracts with visual cues leaves more time for problem solving.
A database of common protocols can also be created as a starting point for teams to build from rather than having businesses have to build their idea from scratch.
Debug smart contracts on private networks
As a desktop application along with a graphQL interface, developers will be able to connect to their private networks and debug their smart contracts as they build them. The interactive interface will help teams watch how NFT ""passports"" get transferred through each transaction, making sure the coins flow in how they are intended.
It will also parse the CBOR data in each transaction and display that information in a properties panel on the screen. Developers can navigate between transactions to confirm that tokens are being passed and processed correctly.
 
Advantages
A visual representation of transactions and smart contracts demystifies how data and tokens are passed along the Cardano network.
This visual representation will make creating new protocols, debugging nascent protocols, and exploring currently running protocols much easier and allow teams to be on the same page during all stages of development.
In design mode, businesses and developers can manually create their protocols, using the graphs to more easily communicate ideas and foster better understanding between everyone involved. Beyond simply laying out the graph, they will be able to indicate details about how NFTs are handled and tokens are passed along.
To share designs, businesses will be able to print out the graph to share directly with others or deploy the interactive graphs to a simple website for others to access.
Since it can run on your desktop, it will allow developers to visually navigate their own private networks while developing smart contracts and other protocols. Seeing details about a transaction at each step will allow for faster debugging and clear communication among their teams.
 
What Has Already Been Done
I have already created a macOS desktop platform for exploring the Cardano blockchain or designing one's own transaction flow.
In explore mode, a user can input the hash transaction into the text bar and then, currently using the BlockFrost API, the app populates the screen with all the related UTXO's or transactions as a series of representative symbols (nodes) and directional links. The resulting graph, following the lead of Plutus pioneers, will be read left to right to represent the flow of tokens through these nodes.
The user can currently visualize transactions, showing all the UTXO inputs and outputs. They can also ""hike"" the blockchain, one transaction at a time using data displayed from each UTXO.
In design mode, the user can drag and drop transactions and UTXO symbols from an icon palette, then draw links between the two to represent the direction of ADA flow between the nodes.
**PROOF OF CONCEPT**
I have launched a website prototype of my application, allowing users to walk to Cardano testnet. It is currently preloaded with a MinSwap transaction. 
This prototype is not suitable for mobile. Please use on a laptop or desktop browser.

Problem: Same fundamental code base being developed over and over
With the increasing adoption of Cardano as a platform to build many new decentralized applications, we have already encountered many redundant and common approaches to many projects. While these projects have their specialized use-cases, the internals are all too common.
Naturally, one may realize these patterns and recognize that there are many opportunities to develop common code to be used by many applications. This code, once developed and open-sourced, could be used and improved by the community constantly, so everyone in the ecosystem would benefit from a shared solution. We want to replicate this successful model — that allowed many libraries, frameworks and the projects that built on these flourish — and bring it to the Cardano eco-system by spearheading a framework to create strong marketplaces.
Solution: A Marketplace Creator
Numerous projects are being built or proposed in Catalyst that aim to create decentralized marketplaces to serve as intermediaries between supply and demand, sellers and buyers, server and clients.
We have identified the need to build a framework in order for people to spin-up their marketplaces.
Just like their simpler Web 2.0 equivalents, blace enables scaffolding marketplaces with a simple blace new, thus cutting down development time and cost.
This proposal aims at developing a core that will power service-oriented marketplaces such as:

Win-Win Dispute Resolution Marketplace: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/368353-48088
Proposals Mentors Marketplace: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/369749-48088
A Tutoring Service
A Language Exchange
A Shared Housing Marketplace
ADA Fans (a media content sharing platform only for ADA fans)
A job board for Plutus developers

Furthermore, product marketplaces (think Etsy, Kickstarter, Ebay) and donation platforms (such as Gofundme) can be built with blace, too.
Plugins / Functionalities
The Base Layer's core functionality can be altered and extended through plugins.
Core components that ship with blace address:

Authorization
Certificates
Currency conversion
Fee collection
Identity management
Offering a service or product
Payment
Requesting a service or product
Review system
Smart contract composition
Status tracking
User profiles

Plugins can have custom rules and parameters (e.g. fees paid to the marketplace operator, refund eligibility, permissions, identity requirements) on a per marketplace level.
Furthermore, by designing core functionality as plugins, even integral parts of blace can be replaced.
If your marketplace needs to meet specific KYC requirements, you can extend or replace the identity management solution that ships with blace.
While not in scope for this phase of development, plug & play NLP-assisted matching of suppliers and buyers will be central to the accelerated growth and usefulness of blace in the years to come.
 
CLI tool
To create or edit a marketplace, you install and run blace from your terminal.
The command line tool is built in Haskell. It will be open sourced once the first marketplace using blace is deployed.
See the gif or our website for a simple demo when setting up a new marketplace via blace new.
 
Other interfaces (e.g. web interface) for ease of access are planned as well.
 
Supporting Cardano's Developer Ecosystem
By creating blace, we help developers by enabling them to skip base layer marketplace work and thus decrease the time to launch their Cardano mvp.
The leading question of the Developer Ecosystem Challenge is: ""How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?"". And we answer: By providing an extensible marketplace creator, so developers can cut costs and focus on the specificity of their projects.
Among the potential directions described in the Challenge Campaing Brief ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26094 ), we believe we are directly addressing:

Developer productivity: IDE's, scripts to automate stuff
Knowledge base & Documentation
Deployment, testing, and monitoring frameworks
Samples, recipes and templates
Support structures

- 4 Plutus Developers (full-time for 5 mo.)
- 1 Project Manager (full-time for 5 mo.)
- 1 Frontend Dev (full-time for 3 mo.)
Tech services (hosting, GCP, GSuite etc.) 1 year: $2200
Marketing: $1500
Total: $115700
 
Project sustainability
While the team is committed to maintain and extend blace post-launch, once the first marketplace is launched through blace, the project will be open sourced for the community to adopt and improve on.
Marketplaces that utilize blace need to either open-source their marketplace or purchase a commercial license. Commercial licenses offset the cost incured through maintenance and running costs.

The Problem
Smart contract development is a specialized skill that is difficult to learn for many. Depending on where a person starts, they may need to learn Haskell, the eUTXO model, and Plutus. Furthermore, the person may need to learn how to set up a development environment that can support their efforts, perform proper testing, and implement general programming best practices (e.g. security).
There's another, more general challenge that we aim to solve with this project. That is the difficulty of knowledge and skill transfer. The ultimate goal of a training program is to prepare someone to be self-sufficient in completing real-world goals and challenges.
In the context of smart contract development, this should mean that after the program, the person can take a programming task, such as building a DEX smart contract, gather requirements, synthesize what they mean, then design, build, and deploy a solution.
However, it is hard to achieve this outcome with simple how-to articles or videos. At the end of reading or watching such content, the developer may still be unable to solve their own development goals.
 
Proposed Solution
Our solution to the problem is to create a Cardano Developer's Academy. This academy will provide a robust, immersive learning experience for Cardano developers. This learning experience was designed with the following principles in mind:

Real-World Projects: Our training content shows how to build real smart contracts. The material will start with basic smart contracts, and proceed to teach advanced concepts
Step-by-Step Explanations: The training content will be built in a modular, step-by-step approach with very good explanations for each step
Hands-On Practice: The training content is integrated directly into a development environment
Code Challenges: In addition to providing step-by-step walkthroughs, we will reinforce the concepts learned by providing challenges for the person to complete

 
How The Solution Works
The learning environment has three major components. First, there is a Learning Management System (LMS) functionality. Second, there is a customized Web IDE that provides access to a Plutus dev environment and the ability to code in a browser. Lastly, there is Cardano course content embedded into the Web IDE.
 
LMS Functionality

Author courses (modules, lessons, labs, code challenges)
Student registration
Student coursework interface

 
Web IDE

Visually explore smart contract designs
Start a dedicated Plutus development environment
Complete coding challenges

 
Course Content

How to design and implement NFT contracts
How to design and implement DeFi contracts
How to design and implement Crowdfunding contracts
Employee Stock Options Programs (ESOP)

 
What's Already Done
We are able to reuse some of the IP that we developed for Skillmix on this project. Here are the features that are built and ready to go:

LMS Features: Course authoring, student registration, student coursework interface
eUTXO Interactive Diagram: Create interactive eUTXO diagrams that aid in student understanding of the smart contract to be built
Plutus Dev Environments: We have an on-demand lab service that can be ported over to Moonar. This lab service can deploy dedicated AWS accounts and Plutus development containers.

 
Project Roadmap
Within 3 Months


Ship the Web IDE


Browser based terminal connected to a dedicated Plutus container


Ability to open remote files on the Plutus container


Ability to edit remote files on the Plutus container


Ability to issue build commands and test Smart Contracts


Ship the NFT Smart Contract course


Ship the Moonar website


 
Within 6 Months

Ship the DeF Smart Contract course
Ship the Crowdsourcing Smart Contract course

 
Definition of Success
In terms of Project Catalyst and Fund6, the most important definition of success for this project is ""developers trained"". Given the budget requested, this project will be a success if it trained 1000 developers. That would be a cost of $18 of ADA per developer trained, which would be excellent ROI.
As part of the funding for this project, we will provide 50,000 hours of Plutus learning lab hours to the community on a first come, first serve basis, for free. Each Moonar account gets 50 hours of lab time for free. That's enough for 1000 student accounts funded by this project.
 
Budget Breakdown
Software Development
1 x Full Stack Developer for 2 Months = $7,000 ($3500 per month)
 
Content Development
1 x NFT Smart Contract Course = $2,000
1 x DeFi Smart Contract Course = $2,000
1 x Crowdsource Smart Contract Course = $2,000
 
Infrastructure
50,000 Plutus learning lab hours = $5,000
 
Licenses
Content: We will open source the courses and make them available on GitHub
Interactive Learning Environment: Most of the IP belongs to another project so this will remain private.
 
Monetization Strategy
Moonar will sell course packages (pay once) and subscriptions (pay monthly) to students that want to learn Cardano development. The packages and subscriptions will include access to the LMS, course content, and the interactive learning environment (including the Plutus development environments).
Final pricing for packages and subscriptions is a work in progress. However, we are aiming to have the following tiers:
 
Package Tiers (One Time Purchase):

Basic Package $30
Pro Package $50
Expert Package $100

Subscriptions (Monthly Fee):

Free Tier
Gold Tier $25 / month
Platinum Tier $40 / month

Reach will build a blockchain-enforced information trade application as a proof of concept of Reach's ability to seamlessly work with your protocol; a first step to demonstrating Reach's ability to support your platform's mission.
The Reach platform provides three essential services via a domain-specific language (DSL) for specifying DApps and a specialized compiler that projects the specification into each of the output components while performing automatic verification of correctness properties.
Ease of Network Adoption
Our DSL uses a subset of JavaScript to specify the DApp at an abstract level involving potentially infinite interactions between individual participants performing finite computations over consensus data in the presence of rely-guarantee assertions. This enables us to abstract over particular blockchain networks, while remaining faithful to the interfaces offered by actual networks.
Since Reach abstracts the low-level details of the blockchain network, it enables DApp authors to develop on one platform (or purely in simulation) and deploy on another network. This is especially valuable for platforms in development that would otherwise need to onboard developers and coax them into rewriting their software to use the new system.
There are many existing DApps that are not built on Cardano and would require significant effort and energy to port. The Reach platform offers a concrete migration path via its abstract model of backend networks; this will increase day-1 adoption of Cardano.
Ease of Component Coordination
The Reach compiler uses type-checking, A Normal-Form transformation, information-flow security, and end-point projection to derive each component correctly from the single specification.
Ease of Correctness
The compiler is integrated with a satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) theorem prover (e.g. Z3) to automatically check the correctness of the application via developer-specific predicates, as well as automatically generated properties. Reach enables formal guarantees to be embedded in the source code and automatically verified. Auditors of Reach programs can objectively assert the correctness of DApps by adding more guarantees to the source code and demonstrating that these new properties are met (or not). Anything that increases the trustworthiness of DApps will be a boon for the blockchain community, which is reeling from the lack of confidence inspired by high-profile attacks.
In summary, Reach builds on decades of research in formal verification, compilation, and optimization of cryptographic protocols. The robustness of these aforementioned techniques will be demonstrated in the building out of the POCPoC blockchain-enforced information trade application on your platform.

Problem Summary
There is a lot of excitement around the Cardano NFT space recently, however currently NFT data is embedded in json metadata stored on the cardano blockchain. Additionally, due to the lack of accepted standards, the data is disparate and hard to query / gain insights from.
Our Solution
Our plan is to build an open-source analytics-ready dataset of Cardano NFT data which provides the community with data about the NFT space.
Data Sources:

Cardano DB-Sync
CNFT.io PolicyID github repository
Cardano Foundation Token Registry

More sources may be added in the data discovery phase
Possible Metrics / Dimensions to include could be:
Metrics

Token mints / burns
Token Transfers
Token counts
Purchase Amounts (as can be gleaned from on-chain data)

Dimensions

PolicyIDs
NFT Projects
Token Names
Attributes / Rarities
Image urls

The aim will be to enable someone to answer such questions as:

How well did a given project perform over time?
What projects were most successful?
What projects see the most after-market activity?
What projects are seeing the most fraud / copies
How many tokens are there in the Cardano ecosystem
Which tokens see the most activity

Deliverables
The output of this project would be an open-source Github repository containing data integration scripts and SQL Queries as well as associated schema documentation.
SQL scripts would be separated between DB-Sync only scripts, and extended scripts which require external data sources to be integrated so that developers who are already running DBSync can get maximum value without implementing the data integration components.
Additionally, if the Cardano Data Hub idea (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Analytics-Data-Hub/368258-48088) gets funded, this dataset will be integrated as one of the available datasets there.
Project Plan and Budget
The project will have 5 components:
Data Discovery - $1,200

detailed data review and profiling of existing data sources
investigation into additional possible data sources
Discussions with community on requests / requirements

Data Modelling - $1,575

Modelling datasets based on available data and community input
Continued discussions with community for feedback

Data Integration - $2,400

Creating data integration scripts to ingest external datasets

SQL Development - $3,000

Develop SQL views to aggregate and implement modelled data

Documentation - $1,200

Provide schema and user documentation for consumers and implementers of the data

 
Budgets are based on a $75/h USD hourly rate. No funds are being requested for infrastructure costs or development tools.
Expected completion date would be 6-8 weeks after funding is received.

Please read my gitbook: https://ancientkraken.gitbook.io/fund6-proposal/
 
A lot of focus is on the Plutus smart contracts but the reality is a majority of smart contracts are simple enough to be written in Marlowe. This proposal seeks to answer the question: what is the true limitation of the Marlowe smart contract language for Cardano?
 
 
I want to create a series of Marlowe contracts and seek out the absolution limit of Marlowe. I want to write a guide for developers to determine when and where the Marlowe language is essential and when Plutus is mandatory. I will attempt to take Plutus code and write out Marlowe solutions in an attempt to find where does Marlowe ends and Plutus begin.
 
 
The guide will be a great contribution to the ecosystem for new developers looking to create a smart contract solution for their idea. Plutus has a steep learning curve while Marlowe is fairly easy to learn. If a new developer could determine if Plutus or Marlowe was the go-to solution then end-to-end development time would be reduced and overall time spent on learning how to code up the smart contracts would be reduced.
 
 
I am asking for 5000 USD to provide economic backing for myself to spend my time developing on Cardano. The guide should be written within a month of the Marlowe release and will be essentially done upon completion.

# Overview
This proposal introduces an SDK, built using TypeScript, that allows developers to interact with the Plutus Application Backend and ChainIndex Service.
The Plutus Application Backend is a critical component when interacting with Plutus smart contracts. The API that the PAB provides allows PAB clients to interact with contract application instances. Contract endpoints which are exposed by running instances can be called via the client API.
For front-end developers, there is currently no well-documented development library that allows users to interact with contract instances in the Plutus Application Backend. Indigo Labs plans to build a Plutus Application Backend TypeScript SDK for interacting with contracts, through both an HTTP API as well as the websocket API. This SDK will also be extended to include API endpoints for the ChainIndex package alongside the PAB.
We believe that this SDK will help create a positive developer experience and allow developers to focus on building successful apps.
# Who is Indigo Labs?
Indigo Labs is a team of developers building key DeFi applications for the Cardano Ecosystem. The first product we plan to build is Indigo Protocol. This SDK we are building is key to bringing our products to life, as well as useful for the greater Cardano developer community.
Our team consists of several Plutus developers, a senior front-end developer, and two tech consultants. With these resources we believe we can produce an excellent API that can be used by hundreds, if not thousands, of dApps. Our team is also a top community contributor to the Plutus GitHub repository, has also contributed to Yoroi, and is active in the dApp development community.
# Metrics / KPI
Size-related metrics:
1. Lines of written source code
2. Code integrity (qa, devops, testing related metrics)
3. Documentation clarity
# Project Roadmap
We run weekly sprints, reports will be provided in our weekly development updates.
Sprint 1 - Develop TypeScript interfaces for all Plutus API responses.
Sprint 2 - Develop HTTP API for interacting with PAB contracts and endpoints.
Sprint 3 - Develop WebSocket API for interacting with PAB.
Sprint 4 - Develop an HTTP API for interacting with the ChainIndex package.
Sprint 5 - Build a testing framework for the API.
All of the code developed will be open sourced under the Apache 2.0 License.

C64 Modular Wallet
Problem statement :
There is a lack of a light wallet in the form of a browser extension that provides a sovereign, customized and simplified interaction with the protocol, facilitating developers experience by supporting different networks, unifying work environments, customizing endpoints and allowing to test and add new use cases in the form of plugins directly from the wallet.
Describe your solution to the problem
Development of a community cross-browser light wallet with a popup format that supports switching networks and unifying all of them within the same tool from the same account, in addition, being able to choose your own trusted endpoints.
Design and implement a modular architecture that facilitates the addition of new use cases in the form of plugins, a way to extend the basic functionality of wallets.
Also, adopt the Connector standard from dcSpark for interaction with web sites[0].
 
Detailed plan
About C64:
The C64 project started in April 2021 with a fund5 proposal[1] for a purpose-built desktop wallet to mint signed NFTs, stored 100% on the blockchain. Allowing anyone to create, verify and link identities to digital assets, such as works of art with the artists.
The development started as a cross-desktop wallet[2], with the imminent arrival of smart contracts the project evolved towards the creation of a wallet to be used from the browser to facilitate interaction with websites.
In this way, the wallet improves the user experience, gains versatility and, besides being able to mine NFTs, we can add new capabilities by adapting to the advances and new functionalities brought by the Alonzo era and future ones.
From Minter to Modular Wallet
Thus, we decided to go a step further and expand the vision and capabilities of the wallet, adapting the initial proposal to a modular wallet, where, starting from a basic wallet functionality with a friendly extension user experience, we will establish new functionalities such as support for switching between different networks, the possibility of choosing your trusted endpoints, and being able to add specific use cases in the form of addons, being the 'C64 Minter' the first to be included.
Merging funds
The funds from the fund5 earmarked for the implementation of the wallet will be used in this proposal for the implementation of the more general-purpose wallet(reducing costs on this proposal). The remaining is being used to develop the main objective of the fund5 proposal, the NFTs Minter use case. More details are provided in the ""Use of Funds'' section.
In this way, we expand the fund5 proposal while still covering all the goals proposed in it.
Adoption:
The light wallet type, the user-friendly 'popup' format, and the quick installation will make it easy for users to adopt it.
The capacity to easily add new use cases/plugins and the ability to customize endpoints will attract more experienced users.
The testnet support and dapps connector integration will appeal for developers.
 
phase 0 / 2 months - Base Wallet & Web development:

  2.Design and implement a modular architecture as plugins based.
  3.Integrate the first plugin: C64 Minter(signed & 100% on-chain), already funded from the previous proposal, fund5[1].
  4.Native tokens support. Send, receive and show tokens. Integrate Alonzo Rust SDK from dcSpark - fund5[6].
  5.Integrate web connector for webapps interaction, developed by dcSpark - fund5[0].
phase 2 / 1 months- Working Product:

Vicente as Advisor ex-Emurgo Yoroi-mobile, R&D Engineer. https://www.linkedin.com/in/vicente-almonacid/
 
BLOCKING PROBLEM AND EVIDENCES:
Interaction with websites through the wallet extension will depend on the availability of dcSpark's implementation of the proposed 'Cardano Connector' standard, funded in fund5[0]
Goals affected by this blocking problem:
Phase 1:
 A (5)
The interaction with smart contracts through the extension wallet will depend on the availability of the PAB (Plutus Application Backend) implementation by the IOHK and then by dcSpark[5] to be run from the browser. The dcSpark Dapps connector is not guaranteed yet, but it is tentative.
Goals affected by this blocking problem:
There are no affected goals in the plans for this proposal. It will affect future plans for interaction with webs and dapps.
 
Future(not covered in this proposal, tentative for next funds):
  1.Restore accounts from Yoroi and Daedalus.
  2.Consolidate funds in the same address.
  3.Integrate Dapp Connector for smart contracts interaction from IOHK adapted by dcSpark proposal [5].
  4.Trezor, Ledger, Yubikey support.
  5.Plugins repository(audited).
  6.+Use cases as plugins.
  7.Staking portafolios.
  8.Code audit.
 
Use of Funds:

Addressing the Challenge :
Our approach to this challenge is to consider and better integrate the economic symbiosis between network participants, specifically Developers, SPO's, and Delegators. There are a number of ways that the current Cardano infrastructure can be leveraged to build layered economic incentives to benefit network participants. By focusing on mutually beneficial incentives, we can produce versions of traditional business functions in more elegant and decentralized ways.
Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state?
Delegators currently receive ADA rewards for delegation, but do not receive any proceeds of Stakepool business operations.
This project aims to provide Stakepools with simple smart contracts for NFT sales, which provide an adjustablee % of sales to delegators.
Via this mechanism, delegators become more invested in the success of their Stakepool, and have a chance to earn continuous rewards based on sales performance.
This could be applied to ongoing payments like royalties as well, and the code could also be modified to target specific NFT holders.
How might the value of solving this problem be quantified and/or measured?
The best measurement will be increased delegation to ""small pools"" away from giant centralizing marketplaces like Binance, Coinbase, etc.
This could be a major driver toward increasing decentralization of the network by giving small pools a greater chance to compete.
 
End State:
Open-Sourced Smart Contract that provides network operators with variable options to deploy proportional sales-based rewards, or ""Dividends"" to delegators.
 
Funds Requested Breakdown:
Dev Services: (Design, architecture, project management, testing, deployment & operator onboarding) - $40,000
Legal Opinion for US based Operators: - $10,000
 
Expected Launch Date: December, 2021 - Pending various unknown unknown's with smart contracts launching.

# Executive Summary
 
WADA introduces and endorses, as part of the Planting Roots in Africa initiative, in partnership with local businesses, represented by Anthony Jackson of Betaplum, and Sacha Robinson of Wutano, this proposal that seeks to introduce both major city centers in Zimbabwe to the Cardano and Catalyst community.
The people of Zimbabwe are in a truly dire situation. Government mandates follow policies dictated by self-interests, and represent a significant challenge to the wellbeing of its people, and innovation to the same extend. Creating an initiative that is centralised is a risk in itself. Based on our experience, we recommend a revised approach to physical hubs, while still carrying the flag of Cardano onto the frontlines.
The primary objective is to create interest for local business in smart contracts, the Catalyst community, and to become activity involved via Hackathons hosted every 2 months. We will support local technology communities in hosting their own events, mitigating the risk of government intervention.
As a Zimbabwean, it is my belief that this program would re-ignite the entrepreneurial spirit that would lift local communities out of poverty. By encouraging parallel initiatives we not only protect the movement from being shut down, but it will likely better meet the needs of the people on the ground, and generate more jobs than a centralised collective.
 
# Strategy
 

Identify existing technology focused groups
Create and market a value chain for developers in Blockchain technology
Generate or collate course materials for the developer onboarding
Incentivise these groups to host Hackathons
Encourage entrepreneurs to participate on projects well suited to smart contracts
Groom the process into a multitude of independent accelerator programs
Deploy a Stake Pool for the local community outside the borders of Zimbabwe (South Africa)

 
# Research
 
=> Tech Communities
Betaplum has already engaged the local tech communities in Bulawayo, and identified equivalent groups in Harare, with a total membership base of 40+ developers. A large (but incomplete) list are available through Betaplum Slack channels.
=> Entrepreneurial Projects
Wutano and Betaplum collectively have a number of suitable projects that would benefit from being involved in accelerator programs. With a team on the ground, and leadership prepared to champion Blockchain, building trust not only for its users but with plans to develop resilient business networks. Sacha Robinson has an existing Business Network, and will expand his reach to find other suitable projects.
=> Stake Pool
Betaplum is a technology provider, and has cheap hardware in reliable data-centers in Johannesburg which can be used to host the Zimbabwe Stake Pool immediately.
 
# Statement of Need
 
=> What critical need does your project or program address?

Lack of exposure to the benefits of Blockchain technology
- As a developer that can charge for their services
- As an entrepreneur with businesses well suited to smart contract
Providing Zimbabwe with rapid development programs for projects that would become too numerous in number for the Government to be able develop a counter strategy
Creating a Stake Pool to be used by smart contracts developed for the local community

 
# Project Activities
=> What specific activities do you propose to meet this need?

Identify communities and influencers who are high value for early adoption
Create and/or accumulate content targeting these groups
Above and beyond marketing, incentives participation through Hackathons that create value chains
Monitor the process, retrospectively refining each event to maximise participation
Have local resources reactively handle challenges that would seek to impede the progress of the program, and possibly provide support to small businesses who were encouraged to launch their products using Blockchain
Install a Stake Pool into the datacenter in Johannesburg, South Africa

 
=> What is the work plan or approach being taken?

Meet with technology groups leaders
Develop and/or accumulate content based on feedback
Launch a monthly Hackathon with prizes to incentivise developers
Develop white-papers for a number of local business projects
Partner with local businesses to market the Hackathons, and develop local business networks
Review, and re-iterate until
- Development groups sustain their own momentum
- Entrepreneurs become aware of the Cardano and Catalyst community as a mechanism to launch new ventures
- The movement can not be massively impacted should any one group be prevented from participating in the efforts

 
=> What will be the output from the project?

Plutus trained developers
Smart contract based small businesses
Accelerator programs which bring these those groups together
Zimbabwe Cardano Champions; Market, Evolve and Protect local efforts
Southern African Stake Pool

 
=> What metrics will be used to track success?

Trained developers
Hosted Hackathons
- Nominated projects
- Participating developers
Business based on smart contracts
- Employed Plutus developers
Unique customer wallets
Staked ADA
Stake Pool uptime

 
=> What geographical areas will be served?

=> What other projects or programs are addressing this need? How does your project or program differ? What effort will you make to work cooperatively (if applicable)?
There are no other programs. We will be partnering with local development organisations, some of whom run Hackathons on occasion.

# Vision of Success
=> If the project or program goes really well, what will success look like in the long term (i.e., beyond the grant period)?
Numerous smart contract-based companies in Zimbabwe, being created out of accelerator programs hosted in all existing technology hubs in major cities in Zimbabwe, each operating independently.
 
# Evaluation Plan
 
=> Identify 3-5 targets that will help you assess your progress toward long-term success in the short term (i.e., during the grant period).

Developer Signups
Company Signups
Tech Hub progress reports

 
# Challenges
 
=> What potential challenges-internal or external-could make it harder to achieve short-term and/or long-term success?

Interference by the Zimbabwe government
Developers leaving the country after becoming qualified

 
# Risk Management
 
=> How will you address the foreseen challenges?
==> Interference by the Zimbabwe government

Support rather than champion programs, shielding our efforts
Simultaneously have an action team that can aid in the challenges for smart contract based companies
Have as many development houses participated in the initiative, creating a non-unified collective that is difficult to directly target

==> Developers leaving the country after becoming qualified

Encourage job creation in local companies that participate in the accelerator programs
Otherwise, their skills will be useful to the Cardano community, just not of value to the Zimbabwe efforts

 
# Budget Narrative
 
=> What is the justification for the amount of money requested?

Courses need to be developed, or sourced, and supported
Travel, time and accommodation to physically meet and identify community leaders
Incentives must be in place to draw attention to an otherwise foreign concept to companies and developers alike
Stake pool setup costs
Business profiling, outreach programs, and follow-up admin
Project oversight, reporting, refinement, thought work and otherwise general admin work required to ensure the success of the project

 
=> Describe in narrative format the sources of all funding for this project or program and how you propose to use the requested grant from Catalyst.
Our primary objective is to host Hackathons. With funding we create a list of technology hubs in Zimbabwe, make efforts to meet and identify their respective community leaders in person, and incentivize them to participate in creating a value chain which their members would participate in. Courses will be created that specifically target each group. Regular progress updates will need to be provided on the readiness of the developers, to align with the launch of the Hackathons per group.
In parallel, in partnership with Betaplum and Wutano, Zimbabwe companies well suited to smart contract development will be introduced to the Cardano community, and whitepapers for use in the Hackathons will be drafted. Enough projects should be scoped to meet the value chain proposed in each group, meeting the developers' expectations.
Funds will be allocated to prize money for the Developers, with a degrading quantity, hopefully to be supplemented by interested business ventures once the value has been established in the market.
Each hackathon event will need to be well marketed, providing maximum support to the respective tech hub host.
A team will be tasked with supporting the businesses, collecting and apply strategies to address challenges specific to the Zimbabwe situation.
A secondary objective is to be able to serve the local community with a Stake Pool. Betaplum will be tasked with the completion of the work, and is only really needed once companies with smart contracts have been established. Hardware is already available.
 
# Long Term Funding Strategy
 
=> If you will need funding for this project or program after the grant period has ended, please describe how you expect to obtain future support.
Companies participating in Hackathons will buy tickets to the events. This will be seen as a business networking event, as well as a Hackathon.
 
# Budget Breakdown
 
Phase 1 ~ Month 1-2

Travel Budget => $1000
Course Development => $3000
Business Outreach => $2880

Phase 2 ~ Month 2-8

Developer Wallets => $1000
Stake Pool Setup => $4000

Phase 3 ~ 4-12

Hackathon Prizes => $8000
Hackathon Event => $4000
Event Staff => $6720

Total => $30600
Excluding Phase 3 => $11880
 
Certainly phase 3 could be delayed to a later funding round, I have chose not to. As far as I am aware the funds are released gradually anyway, and in this category I do not fear excluding other better proposals. May the best project win! 🙂

A data hub for the Cardano ecosystem that makes historical and modelled datasets available through multiple access mechanisms.",26,"Monday, 23 August 2021 23:40",Mike Stewart,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Mike-Stewart/3055521-48088,Vivek Nankissoor,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Vivek-Nankissoor/3058919-48088,60000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Problem Overview
Currently data about the Cardano ecosystem is available, but is spread out over multiple sources.
DBSync is the most detailed source of on-chain data, but it's not easy or cheap to run, and the data contained is highly normalized, meaning it's often difficult to use the data to gain insights without a high level of knowledge about the database schema. Additionally there are other sources of data which must be integrated in order to make the data optimally useful, this includes:

Stake pool metadata server (SMASH)
Extended metadata files as-per the adapools.org standard
Token data from sources such as the Cardano Foundation token registry, and the CNFT.io policyid database
Market data
Social metrics
Many others...

Additionally, there is a wealth of data in the transaction metadata which is specific to certain use cases, and is difficult to access without knowledge of how to query JSON data structures.
There are currently several excellent sites which offer pool specific data such as adapools.org and pooltool.io, as well as several block explorers, however none of these sites provide full historical data, custom queries, or data which has been modelled specifically for analysis or machine learning use cases.
Solution
We propose to build the initial MVP of a community data hub which will provide consolidated analytics-ready data to the Cardano ecosystem.
At a minimum, there will be data available from DBSync and other sources listed above, which have been modelled for various analytics activities. The DBSync data will have additional aggregated views such as the ones in the following repository: https://github.com/cardanocanuck/db-sync-queries
Additionally, we will continue to add special purpose datasets for various domains within the Cardano ecosystem. We have / will be submitting several smaller proposals for specialized datasets to be modelled and developed such as:

On-chain Analytics - Transactions, volume, rewards, etc.
NFT Analytics - information about several aspects of NFT projects
Pool Analytics - Machine Learning ready dataset on historical pool performance
Smart Contract Analytics - (still in ideation phase)

The initial MVP Data Hub will allow the download of CSV data sets. In the future, the range of sharing methods will be expanded.
Some of these sharing methods will be:

API access
Web based data explorer
Community available Google Sheets
Direct cloud database access
Direct data sharing (Azure / Snowflake)

We will prioritize free community access methods, but some access methods such as direct database access or data sharing may be monetized with a subscription model. The purpose of monetizing premium aspects of the data hub is to fund future ongoing development and enhancement.
This proposal is for the core functionality and backend infrastructure development of this community hub.
Project Plan
The requested funds will cover the first 3 months of development of the platform as well as the first 6 months of running costs.
We propose to follow a hybrid waterfall / agile methodology, starting with some upfront architecture and design and feature planning, followed by 4 sprints of feature development. The project plan will be updated throughout this catalyst process as we find team members and refine our idea and feature set.
See attached diagram.
Budget
The budget we are requesting will fund the first 3 months of development, and 6 months of infrastructure costs.
The approximate budget breakdown by role is as follows:

Architect / Senior Dev - 100h * $75 = $7,500
Graphic Designer - 60h * $75 = $4,500
Web Developer - 80h x $75 = $6,000
Data Engineer - 280h x $75 = $21,000
Project Manager - 80h x $75 = $6,000
QA - 40h x $75 = $3,000

Total development costs: $48,000
Infrastructure costs estimated at $2000/mo x 6 months = $12,000
Total Budget: $60,000

Provide a platform for automated,  tamper-proofed and verified contract execution (payments, milestones, legal). Build trust between parties",6,"Monday, 23 August 2021 21:48",Torben,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Torben/3084243-48088,,,80100,Requested funds in USD,"

The Problem:
The demand for developers in the Cardano ecosystem is rapidly increasing and will only become more so. In a decentralized environment with developers and customers spread all over the world, there is so much potential yet on the client side there can be concerns over appropriate content delivery, and on the developer side issues with confidence in payment. Potentially promising projects may fail or not even start due to these lack of trust or communication issues. Moreover, in order to encourage more people to take up work as full-time developers in the Cardano ecosystem, a certain security of income and reliable project specification is necessary.
Additionally, many developers are not well educated on (or interested in the legal aspects of supplier) the finer details of customer relationships. They want to do what they are truly passionate about : develop software!
On the other hand, potential clients may not have experience with software development projects, especially in this new and rapidly developing blockchain environment. They are cautious about taking on ideas and projects to permissionless blockchains like Cardano due to not only a lack of understanding, but also a lack of trust in people and technology.
Today this issue could partly be approached by bringing in an intermediary to act as a middleman. These services can not only be quite expensive for both parties, increasing project costs, but can also be difficult to implement internationally. Furthermore the point of failure is then just shifted to the intermediary and other issues arise if the intermediary does not act fairly or cannot be trusted. High costs for lawyers and consultants can arise, which are not feasible for freelancer or small and medium sized businesses (SMB).
Phase-1:
The system we are developing addresses this issue by providing a platform to fairly and securely work on projects. The goal is to increase the number of successful projects on Cardano and support developers, clients and SMB.
The system is not limited to software development on Cardano, but works as a solution for distributed services in general. At the heart of the solution lies smart contract technology, leveraging the security of the Cardano blockchain, to ensure agreed execution of (software development and other service) projects. The suppliers and clients interact with their specific smart contracts via a web platform.
The platform defines a legal agreement, software specification, project scope, project timeline, milestones and other related tasks. This information is tamper-proof and stored on the Cardano blockchain, so all parties can rely on the agreed specifications and conditions. They can work together without the need of expensive external consultancy.
The system can assure available budget for development teams and clients can be confident that their project goals are achieved according to the defined specification and their satisfaction. All payments are handled in accordance with certain pre-defined conditions and verified by the client. Suppliers can rely on available budget and be sure to get compensated for their work at the agreed time. Clients reduce risk for their investment and avoid opportunity costs. If needed, issues can be claimed by both parties and the system can help them by securing the payment until such a time as a mutually agreeable solution is found.
The payment is intended to happen in ADA. In general the system does not demand crypto currencies, and payments in fiat currencies are also supported. However, in this latter case no automated payment option would be available, as the contract can technically not interact with bank accounts (at least not at this time).
Value-add:

build trust between parties

 

simplify remote work

 

legal support for developers

 

reduce risk for all parties

 

reduce opportunity costs

 

provide a verified mechanism to handle software projects on blockchain

 

tamper-proof project specification and agreements

 

location independence

 

wage protection

 

on-chain payment solution

 
In a first production implementation the system is intended for software development projects, especially those including Plutus Pioneers and similar. At a future point we wish to develop the platform further to be able to handle all kind of agreements in an automated and verifiable manner.
Vision:
In general the platform has high potential for scaling. With a high-enough number of users it can also be used to find appropriate developers for projects. It can also feasibly expand to handle more-or-less every service which can be delivered via the internet.
Furthermore, the platform will provide information on how to handle projects and will implement free interactive guidelines for project management and legal contracts. These guides could inform users on, for example, on what a model legal contract looks like (for software development), which elements are important for both clients and suppliers to be particularly aware of, recommendations on how to have the best possible experience and increase the chances of a successful project. At the same time the platform offers essential services to handle those projects on the Cardano blockchain : automated, verifiable and tamper-proof.
Additionally, the contracting system can be further developed to be able to automatically negotiate legal contracts between parties, by utilizing an AI. By adding these features we open access to use-cases beyond internet deliveries e.g. for logistics and smart electronic devices.
Phase-2: Find Cardano Developers
In a second Phase of the project we want to integrate a free Cardano developers 'database'. Users will have the possibility to add themselves to this service. Companies looking for a developer would be able to search the database and get directly in touch with a potential partner. Projects can be handled on the SOLID platform.
Upon completion of every successfully completed project on the platform, the developer would get an NFT minted by the client through the platform, with associated appropriate metadata attached for identification and verification. By collecting these NFTs a developer would be able to easily provide evidence of relevant experience. Other potential areas include potentially co-operating with one of the great many Cardano education services being proposed (their are some interesting ideas right here on ideascale), for example using similar NFTs (etc) for proof of qualifications.
We envisage that the developers database would be a free service, with no requirement that projects have to be set up or executed on the SOLID platform, while providing great support for both parties.
Value-add:

fee-free service to help match talent and projects for Cardano development

 

build trust through NFT references and qualifications

 

showcase your experience

 

further education will be rewarded

 

direct access to a project execution platform

 

next generation project and talent acquisition platform

 
 
 
What challenge to address:
Attract more developers to build on Cardano, attract more enterprises and SMB to start projects for Cardano.
How the proposal contributes to the challenge:
Providing support structures for developers, development teams and SMB building on Cardano on legal aspects, salary, project execution and building and maintaining trustful relationships with their clients. In this way, encourage companies and developers to begin more projects together and increase the number of successful software development projects on Cardano.
 
 
Goals:
in 3 months:

Beta version is in evaluation and close to production release

 

acquired 10+ partners for evaluation, who will start using the platform on release

 
in 6 month:

first production version of the platform available ( ~February 22)

project execution and legal contracting guides available

 
finish Phase-1

integrating Atala PRISM for customer / supplier identification

 

start on Phase-2 to find developers for projects on Cardano

 
in 9 month:

release first version of Phase-2

in 12 month:

finish Phase-2

 

scaled the system to 1000+ regular users

 

adopted the concept to other use-cases / services

 

integrating advanced features for claimed issues

 

the platform is known as a place to find skilled Cardano developers and successful projects

 

further research and development to handle and automatically negotiate general business contracts

 
 
 
Budget plan:
Funding                                                                                                                      80100 $
       Salary for 3 developers (Front-end, Back-end, Plutus),
       PM, DevOps for the first 4-5 month (~75$/hr)                                                52500 $

       Marketing                                                                                                            4300 $
 
 
 
Potential risks:
Service is not accepted by developers / clients
           How to approach: feedback from the community to make the service fit their needs
Not able to become self-financed in first six months because of small users' base
            How to approach: appropriate marketing and community interaction

Acknowledgments:
Thank you very much Zagita21, for your revision on the english language and your ideas for this proposal !
 
Notes:
The name SOLID is a work in progress name and will not be the finial name of the system, proposals are welcome.
 
Personal note:
Dear community member,
I hope the concept suits you well and that you will support us with your ideas, proposals, suggestions and questions.
I have been working in software development for many years and have a degree in electrical engineering as well as many years experience as an entrepreneur. At the moment I am working in R&D for blockchains in a research center and have run through the Plutus Pioneer program.
With this project we want to contribute to the Cardano community and support the many new smart contract developers out there, who are working hard daily to develop their programming skills. If the project gets funded we want to add a plutus pioneer and a front-end developer to the team. If you are interested to work on this project, get in touch with me.
I am looking forward to your feedback.

The idea of an open window into the data sphere opens up bucketloads of utility. From a static window that your wallet visitors can interact with, to displaying the data stream of sensors in the field. Any number of possibilities arise once the mechanism arrives.
This idea is in the ecosystem challenge because it represents a means for future development. Data and services could flow through NFT and they could even become part of a new interface for Art and data consumption. Smart Contracts enable subscription terms, but selling just a chat window would be bad ass.
These could have a login so only real owner can use it, but they could go wallet to wallet, or within a group (when group ownership comes into play).

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


DESCRIPTION
The highest creative potential depends on the mind's clarity and open vision, yet blockchain project development is often an emotional roller coaster.
As part of the Dyana project, we propose to create community events to develop and deepen the practice of meditation applied to developers' needs. During 6 months we will have weekly meetings on Zoom and develop a Discord community, where we can share the best practices for mental well being. We will dive deeper into the links between mindfulness and creativity, and learn some moving meditations as well.
Being part of a meditation community will help participants in their practice and create a more impactful experience. This will lead to deeper knowledge of the developers needs regarding mental health, and to the creation of the related meditation set.
It will also be the first building block of a meditation network for the Cardano community. At the end of this first phase, each participant will receive an NFT certificate. The community will be incentivized with the Care token to create local meditation groups, with digital and real life presence.
We will then expand the network to the global public...
Qualities we will focus on : happiness, clarity of mind, creativity, empathy, capacity to embrace a large vision and deep understanding.

A UNIQUE **AI-**DRIVEN MARKETPLACE THAT CAN BUILD AND DELIVER  SOLUTIONS  ON CARDANO
Imagine a world where creativity  rules, formal verification is the law, and an AI-driven marketplace serves up customized applications on-demand. Our Product, QModeler, is built using a unique technology that allows uses to assemble smart contracts like legos. We are ready to take the next step by having AI assemble fully working applications including smart contracts from those Legos.
IF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE REDUCED AS A FIRST STEP TO THE SAME PROBLEM SPACE AS BUILDING TOYS FROM LEGOS AND ASSEMBLING JIGSAW PUZZLES THEN IT CAN BE AUTOMATED. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS FIRST STEP
 
 

 
P R O G R E S S  T O  D A T E
The technology behind QModeler reduces the problem of AI solution development to the problem of assembling toys from legos. QModeler's interactive user guidance feature already uses advanced algorithms to make 90% of the decisions required to build software from specifications. We have prototypes of a working solution - see GitHub. We feel very certain that we are very close to unlocking the key to having AI building software for us from specifications. 
U S E  O F  F U N D S
90% of the funds for this project would be used to host a KAGGLE competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) to attract a large number of teams consisting of acclaimed experts in AI. We may expect to have many  teams with experts in several branches of AI competing to produce the wining solution. When the competition is over the solutions of all teams are available to us to select us. The remaining funds will be used to set up and manage the competition.
W H O  W E  A R E
We believe technology should unite and not divide us. We strive to democratize technology by simplifying it so that innovation happens across all strata of society. Our vision will be realized when any sized company, from enterprise to a small business owner, or even a single person with a yen to create, can innovate solutions to their problems. Ferdon - the maker of Qmodeler is  located in Vietnam. QModeler is a supporter of the Vietnam National Computer Olympic Team where many of our team members competed. 
Ferdon is a company of currently 20 people passionate about democratizing technology. Ferdon has been working 3 and a half years to build our flagship product, QModeler, one of the first no-code  platforms and the first no-code platform for blockchain. QModeler is capable of synthesizing models into smart contracts.
Ferdon is launching the first of its kind, no-code hackathons, long-running  events that bring together communities to solve pressing issues using No-Code tools.  
Ferdon's active projects include

In collaboration with WADA we have launched a first of its kind no-code hackathon to develop a solution for food safety traceability in Africa.
Launching a no-code hackathon in Vietnam to develop a solution to food traceability  in Vietnam. 

flagship product
Ferdon's flagship  product is a low-code platform for developing the blockchain. see link below

 A B O U T  K A G G L E
Ferdon will be setting up a competent on kaggle to train an AI algorithm to assemble software legos into full applications. Kaggle is the world's largest community of data scientists with:

5 million members  
4 million uploaded solutions 
300  competitions
50,000 open data sets 

You can read more about Kaggle competitions here ->  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions
A B O U T  T H E   P R O J E C T
 This project will set about to create a new era in software development by introducing AI assembled software.  This project is to fund hosting a  Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) , where we expect several experienced teams to work on completing the prototypes we have developed. 
what is graph pebbling
Graph Pebbling is a board game that, because it has a property called Turing Complete, can be used to solve computer problems and is as powerful as any computer language. Graph Pebbling has been the subject of hundreds of research papers.
why is graph pebbling important
An AI solution to create a winning strategy for Graph Pebbling is also a solution to some of the worlds most pressing problems and will unlock a new ways to think about software and software solutions to many of the worlds most urgent problems, available on-demand to those who need them most.
QModeler was built using Graph Pebbling and does not support any other language. Because of this QModeler can be made to synthesize smart contracts, logic for IoT devices, cloud applications,... 
how hard is this problem to solve
We are confident it is not hard. The hardest part of solving the many problems is reducing a problem to a know problem space- in our case component assembly.  We provide (1) a clear unambiguous definition of how components fit together and (2), a way to unambiguously define what it is we want to be build. (3) a user-friendly way for non-technical users create components and describe what they want to build.  (1) and (2) define a problem space with several solutions in solving board games, assembling legos, and solving crossword puzzles. 
  why use gaggle
There are several reasons why we decided to host a  Kaggle  Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)

access to experts or Kaggle Masters
training AI algorithms requires expensive specialized hardware 
Kaggle competitions will produce many solutions from many competitors that we want to review. 

 what kind of applications benefit the most
Any application could benefit but categories that would benefit more than others includes

applications that involve many parties  such as supply chains, food provenance, cold chains, market places
applications that integrate with other on-chain protocols such as AMM, exchanges, liquidity pools. 
applications that integrate with off applications - oracles, enterprise applications...
applications that require on-ramping into enterprises such as banks and others 
applications build through no-code crowd sourcing. 

M O N I T I Z A T I O N  M O D E L
 Developers work in a highly centralized model where the middleman, large software vendors,  receive the lions share of profits.  An AI based system will allow developers to set prices of components they build and track when the component is being used. 
   We expect around 2% -20% of the revenue produced by an AI generated product will be divided among the builders of the       component 
I M P A C T

reduced cost of software -  A single toolbox of components can create several, hundreds, of highly customized applications. 
developer productivity - The productivity of developers will skyrocket many fold. Developing a solution will produce components, or legos, that AI can use to create solutions for many problems spaces. AI will take care of assembling the other solutions when they are requested. 
templates creation -  The AI marketplace is better than a template, Ai will be able to create several applications from the same legos.  
developer Incentivization - Developers will get  continuous streams ofrevenues from components they upload to the marketplace. 
network effects - The project will increase the network effect on Cardano by increasing interoperability. optimistically we could calculate this to be the square if the interoperable components. 
Ecosystem Richness - A toolbox of software building blocks can be the genesis of hundreds, even thousands, of applications. 
More Targeted Applications - Many applications such as food safety have a one-size-fits all approach but sadly that one-size does not fit rural farmers in Africa or Vietnam. Many such applications are highly flows negotiated between a few small farmers and can't be captured in a single application. 

F E A S A B I L I T Y
  The project will determine if teams on the Kaggle platform (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) can assemble components built using QModeler where the rules that prescribe which components can be connected and how they should be connected have been unambiguously defined. 

Our team has already achieved over 90% automation ( demonstrated in our video )
The teams at Kaggle are the best AI experts in the world.  The title of  Kaggle Master and Kaggle Grand Master  is a universally recognized distinction. (https://www.kaggle.com/progression)
This is a known problem space with several known AI solutions that already exist.  
Often over 1000 teams will compete to to solve a single challenge, with teams using different approaches. 
AI can assemble toys from Legos and solve Jigsaw Puzzles. All these problems have the same characteristics namely (1) a clear unambiguous definition of how components fit together and (2), a way to define what it is we want to be built. 
AI has been highly democratized and with tools like OpenAI that can train algorithm to have winning strategies against board games rather easily. Our technology can be viewed as

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano already has a highly humanized and gamified wallet commited 100% to lower the entry barrier for students, entrepreneurs, junior developers and people in general around the world. It's called GameChanger and it's primary goal is to allow people focus on what really matters rather than loose attention on infrastructure, language complexities and high level coding skills requirements.
GameChanger current key features:

Light-client, non-custodial, fully responsive progresive web app (PWA) wallet, ready to be used in any device without installing. Coming from an emerging country, we know that is hard to make users install applications on their phones and even computers when they sometimes won't have storage left or an adecuate and clean environment to install executables.
Mainnet, and Testnet wallet as well to allow developers and students to test without spending real value.
First deeply gamified wallet in the Cardano Ecosystem, where your balance is like a game inventory, and you move assets (coloured cards) as they were tangible objects, allowing you to make the simplest transaction to even multi-asset, multi-output transactions with the same intuitive interface. We are truly unleashing Cardano's potential by allowing even newcomers to send the most advanced transactions with the easiest UI in the ecosystem and breaking more than a decade of inherited UI trends that are inadecuate in front of Cardano capabilities
No more manually settings for fees and minimum ADA values, the wallet calculates all this for you. Sending a single token has never been easier, just pick the asset you want to send and the wallet adjusts the rest.
Native NFT and tokens support with visual representation from day one. Token avatars helps you identify same minting policies to quickly discover fake tokens and visually respect NFTs collection similarities. Token registry verification check.
Strict audit stage for any transaction sending request, letting the user to review their actions prior sending.
Builtin NFT Creator, drag and drop any file type, (not just images) to mint a single NFT or even a profesional collection in an automated way. Make NFT drops with the same gamified UI with final review stage.
URL-based dApp connector, allowing social networks, blogging sites, landing pages and even emails and e-messaging to carry payment links, donation buttons, metadata, tokens and NFT minting links on Cardano Blockchain. We plan to cover smart contracts and other features soon so please stay tunned.
Here is a simple ""minter tweet"" to try this out:
https://twitter.com/GameChangerOk/status/1433861451618426880?s=20
Builtin Playground (IDE): dApp connector editor and HTML and URL generator. GameChanger Script editor, a JSON-based dApp connector scheme that already has been succesfully coded by non-developers proving that to help developers focus on building, we must simplify our coding languages and tools. Users can start coding this scripts by editing all the demos already integrated in the editor. Implement payments, NFT drops and complex transactions in a couple of minutes ending up with a ready to use autogenerated HTML dynamic dApp integration or a static copy-and-paste URL.
(e)UTXO model visually exposed, ideally for devs and students to audit and learn how Cardano works. This plus Playground materializes our commitment to students and junior developers.
Code based on Emurgo's cardano-serialization-lib, the core of Yoroi Wallet.
Private key isolation inside Web Workers, read-only mode, and more.
Open source, community driven API backend, using IOHK's cardano-graphql and relying on Dandelion APIs, whom infrastructure efforts has allowed us to put our wallet online because we can't afford our own infrastructure yet as we have been supporting this development with our own savings and the required cloud hosting is very expensive in our country. Because we lack fair infrastructure capabilities and we are a very small team we are working closed source for now looking to reach sustainability first.

 
Why GameChanger:
I believe that Cardano is the real game changer here otherwise I would't choose it to build with, but I must confess I didn't planned to build this wallet at the beginning. I faced a month of language communication issues, lack of documentation, delayed answers, expensive to deploy infrastructure and bugs while trying to build on Cardano. And it's ok, because it's a rising ecosystem and it's totally understandable, I knew soon this would change for good. But I thought it was a shame, so much potential in front of us and I couldn't reach it at the moment. I learned from this and I developed GameChanger to help others focus on materializing their projects on Cardano much much faster and with a smoother experience.
 
Proposal:
Help us to prepare ourselves to onboard new users at scale and improve GameChanger Wallet to fully adapt to it's upcoming third party application ecosystem while contributing back to Dandelion APIs to let them help others developers as well with the API's, some of them being developers building dApps with this wallet: A very productive feedback loop.
 
Proposed plan (5 months of work):

Support other feedback loops that are in the talks with communities such as Gimbalabs, and individuals, by offering support and adding new frequently requested features.
Add smart contracts capabilities
Improve overall wallet, bug fixing, refactoring.
Add more demos to Playground
Docs, tutorials.
Add a Dapp Discovery Hub or Marketplace to make all existing dApps available within the wallet
Prepare the code for internationalization
Talks, debates, and educative events side by side with community partnerships such as the one taking place next Tuesday 24/8 on Gimbalabs Discord
Grow user base by reaching potencial users/startups and try to cover their needs
Cover for 1 year our own infrastructure costs while also contributing to Dandelion APIs to potenciate a feedback loop and with a stronger infrastructure help them and us onboard more developers with the open source APIs.

 
 
Budget breakdown:

Lead, Fullstack Dev + support for dApp teams [400hs x $40] $16000
Sys. Admin. (ext. collaboration and inside role) [200hs x $30] $6000
Landing Website Front End (demos, tutorials,docs, maintenance) [200hs x $30] $6000
Marketing efforts ( Explainer videos, campaigns, talks, events ) $3000
Graphic design $2000
Self Dandelion Infraestructure (mainnet + testnet) [12 months x $600 ] $7200
Shared Infraestructure collab. to Dandelion and backup (mainnet + testnet)  [12 months x $600 ] $7200

 
Auditability and metrics:

Metadata: we can use metadata to have some usage metrics but always while preserving our users privacy.
How this can be gathered? by executing a query like this one already showing real GameChanger dApp transactions in testnet: https://postgrest-api.testnet.dandelion.link/tx_metadata?key=eq.73&json-%3E%3Etype=eq.tx
Dapp Discovery Hub: number of dApps implementing GameChanger
Social networks for interaction with users and their feedback
Weekly reports

 
How success looks like since funding event?

Day zero BC (Before Catalyst): Wallet is already online, some other features and improvements will be taking place prior to the funding as they have been requested for dApp teams that needs them and are common use cases.
After 3 months: Proposed development will have already started, self and shared infraestructure setup will be online and orchestration with Dandelion network will begin (IAN network). Talks and new feature support with third party dApp teams will be taking place. DApps will be integrated already using what's available for them, helping the Cardano dev ecosystem to grow, easing the learning/developing curve on tasks like payments,NFTs drops, token issuing, metadata, payments on marketplaces, passwordless logins powered by Cardano, etc.   
After 6 months AC (After Catalyst): Proposed development will be finished, some new features implemented to allow better dApp integrations, all backend infrastructure will be online, many dApps will be using GameChanger already, growing Cardano ecosystem even more. Smart contracts will be added to the feature list, allowing a wave of new dApp teams to join the ecosystem.
After 12 months: dApp discovery hub will be populated with real use-cases on Cardano, a user-base will be formed and the ecosystem will have months of grow, moving ahead to new ideas and challenges to make it bigger.

a. Problem statement:
(for Vietnamese, I share my idea in the youtube link below)
Yoroi is a light wallet for Cardano. It's simple, fast, and secure so that Yoroi looks to be a day-to-day wallet for Cardano users. Performing transactions on a software that uses a language other than the mother tongue often makes users more cautious, slow to operate, and often makes mistakes. This is also a barrier that prevents users from using yoroi or accessing Cardano's ecosystem
The solution here is to add the Vietnamese language to the Yoroi wallet's available language list. This will help users feel closer, more trusting with Yoroi, and want to have more access to Cardano's ecosystem.
b. Deliverables:
We will translate and localize the language of Yoroi wallet for Vietnamese language users within the first 3 months after receiving the budget and keep updating, refining for one year.
c. Benefits to Cardano Ecosystem:
As Emurgo claims ((https://emurgo.io/blog/yoroi-wallet-what-it-means-to-be-the-metamask-wallet-of-cardano ), Yoroi is the metamask of the Cardano ecosystem, a native digital wallet that can be the cornerstone to easily interact between the dApps and its blockchain plays a very important role for users. So adding a native language (Vietnamese) to yoroi will help the user's application development communities find yoroi more friendly, more confident in conducting transactions and developing dApps.

Use industry standards for information provenance to create a truly trustworthy oracle specification and free software that implements it.",19,"Sunday, 22 August 2021 02:04",Peter Van Garderen,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Peter-Van-Garderen/3061855-48088,,,49500,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


More background on the problem:
Blockchains are said to be ""trustless"" thanks to cryptographic proofs. However, smart contract developers need access to *trustworthy* information external to the blockchain to serve as inputs to their application logic. For example, a change in the BTC/ADA price may trigger a limit order on a DeFi platform, the final score in a soccer match may trigger a payout in a betting Dapp, or an extreme weather event may trigger a crop insurance claim.
Oracles are the blockchain primitives that provide this real-world information to on-chain smart contracts. The data they provide must be authentic as it will have significant financial consequences. However, there is a risk that the critical role of oracles in the Cardano smart contract ecosystem will be overlooked or downplayed in face of the (justified) Goguen era hype and the flurry of pre-launch project announcements.
The small crop of existing oracle solutions, such as the Ethereum big fish Chainlink, do a good job articulating the ""oracle problem"" but when you dig deeper you see that they often conflate information security with information provenance. If you look past the slick ICO marketing and whitepapers you are really being asked to trust their technical decisions and collaborators rather than an open specification and easy-to-audit architectures. Even with sound security protocols, the opportunities for manipulating oracle information somewhere in their provenance pipelines remain ripe without the solution being proposed by the Orcfax project.
Our solution:
A standards-based specification and open source software that *explicitly* expose and archive the flow of information from real-world data sources (e.g. APIs, open datasets, reports), through oracle architecture stacks, and onto the Cardano blockchain.
The project is called ""Orcfax"" as a play on words combining ""oracle"" and ""facts."" A Cardano-branded orca is our logo.
We will publish the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification and develop an open-source, Cardano-native reference implementation. This software will act as a pragmatic proof-of-concept for the specification as well as provide Cardano developers and oracle providers with a free and open source tool to deploy their own Orcfax-based solution.
To draft the specification we will assess and apply proven industry standards that were developed over many years of open collaboration by communities of domain experts. These include:

W3C PROV-O: the definitive specification for expressing information provenance. See https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-prov-dm-20130430/
W3C Verifiable Claims: the definitive specification for third-party verification of online information. https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/
ISO 17068: the definitive specification for maintaining trustworthy repositories of authentic information. See https://tinyurl.com/39acbewk
ISO 27001: the definitive specification for maintaining an information security management system. See https://www.iso.org/standard/54534.html
NIST Zero Trust Architecture: the definitive report on best-practice security architecture that focuses on constant authentication and authorization instead of network-based privileges. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf

We will also reference the nascent body of academic research on blockchain recordkeeping, particularly in the field of archival science and research data management. See for example:

Building Decentralized Trust (2021) https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030544133
A Blockchain-Based Notarization Service for Biomedical Knowledge Retrieval (2018) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037018300400
Trusting Records in the Cloud (2019) https://www.facetpublishing.co.uk/page/detail/?k=9781783304028

Additionally, we will analyze ubiquitous tools for managing information integrity and re-usability that offer an opportunity to bridge trustworthy Cardano data with the wider web domain where most of the online world will continue to conduct its day-to-day affairs. These include Git, IPFS, JSON-LD, Schema.org, and Wikidata.
The reference implementation software will be a working proof of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification, both of which will be published to our Github repository under open source licenses.
The reference implementation's technical architecture will leverage Cardano's unique on-chain metadata blocks and copy best-of-breed oracle design patterns such as those demonstrated by Chainlink, Web3 API, and Charli3. We are most excited about applying the Oracle Pools design, first publicized by Emurgo, which normalizes multiple data sources and leverages Cardano's unique Extended UTXO design.
Defining success:
After one month:

The first draft of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification has been circulated for community review and feedback.

After three months:

Version 1.0 of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification has been published.
The Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of the Orcfax reference implementation has been deployed on the Cardano blockchain.
Community consultation with Cardano smart contract developers has begun to define the most in-demand oracle endpoints for the first wave of Orcfax oracle deployments: e.g. cryptocurrency price data, sporting event data, weather data, real estate data, public health data, etc.

After six months:

The Orcfax Open Oracle Specification has been updated based on the practical knowledge gained from the MVP implementation.
The beta version of the Orcfax reference implementation has been published and has been deployed by one oracle operator external to the Orcfax team.
The Orcfax project has deployed its own oracle endpoint(s) which has been tested by at least three smart contract developers external to the Orcfax team.

After nine months:

An Orcfax sustainability plan will be circulated for community feedback. This may include oracle transaction fees, more Project Catalyst funding requests, an Initial Stakepool Offering (ISO) offering, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) or some combination of these. We are not putting the cart before the horse. Orcfax first has to demonstrate that it is an intellectually and technically sound solution and that it has garnered community interest. The primary objective of the sustainability plan is to propose the most cost-effective option that will ensure the long-term availability of affordable, trustworthy, real-world information on the Cardano blockchain.

After twelve months:

The Orcfax sustainability plan has been implemented.
Orcfax oracles are providing actionable, real-world information to ten+ in-production Cardano smart contracts that hold and distribute ADA.
The Orcfax Open Oracle Specification is pursuing a formal standardization process (e.g. CIP, IEEE, W3C, ISO).

Budget:
The requested Fund 6 budget is for wages and server expenses for the first three months of the Orcfax project. This will deliver the first version of the Orcfax Open Oracle Specification and the reference implementation MVP:

1 x Senior Architect (Peter Van Garderen) x 20 hours per week x $75 USD/hr x 12 weeks = $18,000
1 x Systems engineer (TBD) x 20 hours per week x $75 USD/hr x 12 weeks = $18,000
1 x Software developer (TBD) x 20 hours per week x $75 USD/hr x 8 weeks = $12,000
Server and transaction fees: $500 x 3 months = $1,500

The $75/hr rate is on the mid-salary scale for senior professionals in the digital archiving and software engineering field (in the Western hemisphere). All three project roles include time allocated for project management and community engagement tasks.
The team members will provide their own computing equipment. Hosting for the project website and code repositories are provided free of charge via Github. Community outreach will be done via (free) Twitter and YouTube accounts as well as the various Project Catalyst communication channels.
Division of responsibility:
The senior architect and systems engineer both have software engineering skills. They will collaborate in the first month using Agile software development methodology to define and validate the technical requirements for the MVP. While the Open Oracle Specification will be based on the industry standards listed above, it will also be informed by the pragmatic technical requirements identified during this initial analysis stage.
Once the technical stack has been selected in the first month, a software engineer with the relevant language skills will be added to the team to help complete the MVP.
The systems engineer will take responsibility for maintaining and securing the off-chain oracle server infrastructure and Cardano node communications.
The senior architect will be the primary author of the specification as well as the software development supervisor.
Licensing:
The source code for the Orcfax reference implementation will be published under a free and open-source MIT license.
The Orcfax Open Oracle Specification will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-ND 4.0) license.
This will make the specification free to use and re-distribute in any format. However, the ""No Derivatives"" clause means that altered versions cannot be published. This is to avoid the cherry-picking of specific clauses without respecting the full intent of the specification. That would dilute its reputation and validity. Once it's published, a formal revision process for the Open Oracle Specification will be announced.
Who we are:
The Orcfax project is led by Peter Van Garderen, a professional archivist and world renowned expert in the field of digital archiving. See https://vangarderen.net
Dating back to medieval times, the archival profession has maintained standards and practices for protecting and demonstrating the authenticity of documents and information objects. Peter is a pioneer in developing free and open-source software systems that implement these standards. He is the founder of Artefactual Systems, a bootstrapped FOSS service company that provides development and support services for the hundreds of institutions worldwide that have deployed the archiving solutions he developed. See http://archivematica.org and https://accesstomemory.org
Peter is also a long-time decentralization advocate and researcher. He spoke on applying archival principles to blockchain technology at the first Decentralized Web Summit hosted at the Internet Archive in 2016. In the past twelve months he has led development teams that won several Filecoin hackfests with projects that provided a Python interface for Filecoin, archived Open Image datasets onto the Filecoin network, and a tool for migrating Facebook content onto Filecoin.
Peter will draw on his wide network of colleagues, collaborators, and newly found Catalyst contacts to hire an experienced systems engineer and software developer who will help him to refine the Orcfax specification and deliver the Orcfax reference implementation software. He is currently in discussion with several qualified systems engineers for that key role.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


What is The Innovatio Founder?
The Innovatio Founder aimed to be a P2P crowdfunding marketplace with multiple funding modalities that uses the Cardano blockchain to deploy smart contracts and meta-data facilitating the funding of diverse start-ups and DApps in a secure, transparent and efficient ecosystem.
This marketplace is focused on technology, innovation, video games, and design categories. The first crowdfunding model available will be the rewards category, where the investor receives the product or service in the future.
The Innovatio Founder would be a private company, which will comply with EU rules and regulations allowing it to offer this service throughout all the EU, enabling the mass adoption of blockchain technology in the European market.
 
What is Innovatio's vision for the next 5 years?
In the crowdfunding market, investors can be from anywhere in the world, but not the projects that start their crowdfunding campaign, so Innovatio will start operating in the European Union.
While Innovatio is accentuating itself as a crowdfunding platform in the European Union and growing the brand name and community, the intention is to expand licensing in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and APAC.
As mentioned before, the first funding category is rewards-based, where the project must give a reward in return (product/service/membership/tokens, etc).
Innovatio intends to add different modalities in the future such as equity and debt, this requires another type of license and another type of Smart Contract templates, so the vision is to implement equity in the next 2 years and debt in the next 3 years.
Innovatio's vision for the next 5 years is to be able to operate globally, not including China, allowing projects to start their crowdfunding campaigns under different modalities (Reward/Equity and Debt).
 
How does it work?
The Innovatio Founder is a Crowdfunding platform that allows fundraising campaigns under different crowdfunding modalities, allowing legal entities and DApps to raise funds in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.
The projects that want to start their Crowdfunding campaign must provide sufficient information to represent the project in a smart contract and a legal document that ensures the investor. In this way, subsequent investors will be clear about the responsibilities and commitments of the campaign.
Implementing the GameChanger Wallet we can facilitate the adoption of the blockchain by the general public, facilitating investments with fiat and cryptocurrency and representing the transactions on the blockchain with meta-data, allowing a transparent and secure tracking of the funds.
When a project reaches its fundraising goal, it will start to use the funds raised progressively, fulfilling the milestones previously defined in the legal contract in an audit process between the project and the investors, ensuring the correct use of the funds.
If a project does not meet a milestone or the funding goal is not achieved, a re-funding to investors will occur in whole or partially.
 
What is the Innovatio community?
The Innovatio community is a private initiative that seeks to bring together entrepreneurs and developers from many areas who are interested in using, developing, and implementing blockchain technology in business models, contributing to the adoption of the technology and its visibility.
The Innovatio community also helps new members outside the blockchain world to get to know the other Catalyst communities, where they can turn to learn or talk about other topics (Governance, Technical Solutions, Workshops, etc.).
As the community grows, it will migrate to a new website, where the networking and content generated will be easier to consume and share.
This community is public and the proposals below are to increase the marketing and content developed for it.
We recommend reading these different proposals that revolve around the community:
Proposer outreach: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Crowdfunding-Website-for-Proposals/352260-48088
Multilingual Resources: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Educational-Content-in-a-Single-Web/367666-48088
DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Entrepreneur-Community-Mentoring/369325-48088
 
General Project Catalyst ecosystem issues.
1. Fewer than 12% of proposals presented are funded in each funding round for the limitation of treasury funds.
2. Project Catalyst is not likely to attract mainstream or even cryptocurrency investors.
3. Community focused on educational, technological, and governance development, but with little focus on mass-market adoption and business value.
4. The channels and means to identify co-founders, team members, and users is very limited, hindering the mutual collaboration potential of the community.
5. The community has little reach to people in another ecosystem or outside of the blockchain world.
 
How will The Innovatio Founder benefit the Catalyst ecosystem?
1) The size of the crowdfunding market is 50 billion per year, which would allow you to raise a co-incredible amount of funds, in addition to being able to present your project to fiat investors.
2) The possibility of contributing large amounts of money and transfers to the Cardano ecosystem, thanks to its continuous SWAP of tokens.
3) Financial company pioneer in adopting Cardano technology to implementing investments with crypto and fiat currencies, and securing marketplace investors with smart contracts and meta-data.
 
How will The Innovatio Founder help Entrepreneurs and Developers?
1. Innovatio's brand comes with its public community, which will allow hundreds of developers and entrepreneurs to interact with each other, bringing great creativity and business value to Catalyst.
2. Entrepreneurs and developers who have a project in more advanced stages can focus solely on the business model to raise massive funds.
3. Developers will mainly be able to use and have an official GameChanger Wallet support, as we have a mutual collaboration agreement.
 
What will the funds from this proposal be used?
If the proposal is successful in obtaining the requested funds, it will be used to develop a functional MVP within the next 3 months.
¿What does this MVP consist of?
1) User experience on the web for companies and buyers (Profile creation and customization, visualization of crowdfunding campaigns, and pre-draft to start a campaign).
2) Simple and practical creation of an external wallet and connection to the user's account with GameChanger.
3) Smart Contract template with the functionality of raise funds in various cryptocurrencies.
4) Implementation of the audit system for the release of funds raised through milestones.
 
Future implementations:
🔔 Raise funds in fiat currency via debit/credit card.
🔔 Representation of start-ups and investors in the real world (Data-base) and on the blockchain (Digital IDs) with meta-data.
🔔 Legal contract with commitments and responsibilities of the start-ups crowdfunding campaigns stored in the blockchain through meta-data.
 
Milestones and Roadmap
✔️ Legal issues in the implementation of blockchain in the fiat/crypto market.
✔️ Architectural solution for the implementation of payment in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies
✔️ Architectural solution for the use of smart contracts and meta-data in the crowdfunding marketplace

2. Projects that have achieved their first funding on Catalyst and have reached their funding goal through a crowdfunding campaign.
3. The number of DApps using Innovatio's marketplace to start their crowdfunding campaigns to raise funds.
4. Verified members of Innovatio's Community.
 
Breakdown Budget
Currently, Innovatio is developing little by little, thanks to the efforts of 10 people who voluntarily and in their free time can contribute a grain of sand.
For the full development of the MVP we will need to allocate resources in:
CTO and CEO Salaries: 7.200$/mo x3 months: $21.600

A personalisable avatar associated with a wallet that can be used for transactions. Provide an API that is easy and secure to use.",34,"Saturday, 21 August 2021 08:53",Matthias Sieber,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Matthias-Sieber/3073739-48088,Victor Corcino,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Victor-Corcino/3062084-48088,87700,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


How it works

Using the gravatar application users can create a Gravatar for a payment address from their wallet.
A gravatar will have a unique username. In addition it will have an optional display name. For example, a username can be emily.sang@ada the display name can be Emily William Sang. Another example, for a restaurant can be tacobell2165@ada with the display name Taco Bell - Staton Island 1281.
Users can set privacy setting for their gravatars whether to show their display name or not.
The gravatar can be shared in the form of username@domain or a QR code.
A registry of gravatar to the payment address is maintained by the gravatar application.
Users can search by gravatar ids on the gravatar registry's website and by the display name depending on the privacy setting. Third party dApps and apps can integrate the gravatar service via APIs.
The gravatar registry will provide a lookup for searching by username.
Payments that are initiated to a gravatar will be received at the payment address used for creating that gravatar.

 
Personalization

Users choose their own username.
Gravatar will support different themes. Imagine it to be like cards that have different designs. Say a formal look and feel for official purposes, sporty aesthetics for friends, with logos for businesses.
Users can create multiple gravatars for the same wallet by using different payment addresses.

 
Security
Gravatar uses only publicly sharable payment addresses and an optional meta data like display name, logo etc for building the registry. No private or sensitive information relating to the wallet or the user is required.
 
Use cases

For individuals, as a user-friendly payment address to received ADA. No hassle of dealing with public key hashes.
For businesses, an identifiable payment address for their customers.
In general, human readable addresses for every wallet. Transacting in crypto does not have to feel peculiar with the hashed addresses anymore. This would be one step closer to a world where everyday transactions can be done using ADA.

 
Challenge Fit
From the challenge setting, success is explained as follows:
""Liveliness. Happy energized developers making money and achieving their goals, mutual help, collaboration, and a shared feeling of success. A feeling of unexpected innovation happening ""on it's own"". A wide variety of resources are provided for developers allowing them to focus on business value they can generate and not on infrastructure.""
Gravatar for ADA Wallets emerged as a concept when specifying the functionality of the Win-Win Dispute Resolution Marketplace ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Win-Win-Dispute-Resolution/368353-48088 ). In conversations with developers of other projects we identified a need to put faces to addresses. This project fills that gap. One such example is the GameChanger Wallet ( https://gamechanger.finance/ ), but we are sure most dApps will eventually utilize Gravatar for ADA Wallets or a similar API.
As an open API, the project fits right into the Developer ecosystem challenge.
 
Similar solutions
Unlike other proposed solutions in the space ( i.e. https://adahandle.com ), Gravatar for ADA Wallets allows for a wallet to have multiple identities.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Desired Outcome
To make Cardano dapps accessible to the global population on iOS and android with rich native experiences
Blocking problem
Teams are having to keep up with innovation on the blockchain, and don't have resources to create mobile apps plus web clients.
Costs of the problem
Less adoption and accessibility for Cardano, especially in Mobile first continents like Africa and South America. The global economy was an estimated $84 Trillion in 2020, (*1) with North America only contributing a fraction of the total. (*2)
Evidence
https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/04/tech/mobile/africa-mobile-opinion/index.html, https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-07-19/more-chinese-use-internet-mobile-phones-computers, https://medium.com/seedstars/mobile-and-internet-penetration-in-latin-america-part-1-541b8947b3f4, *1 https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/, *2 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO
We will create a base level app infrastructure that can easily conform to the basic needs of an enterprise grade app capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of users using the latest technology like GraphQL, React Native and TypeScript. This will expedite the time to market for many projects in development for Cardano. Our first partnership will be with a ticket sales and exchange platform that is also separately seeking funding in this round.
We will leverage many open source technologies to build a flexible application framework to help teams deploy their applications on mobile devices and reach the billions of people who only have internet access via a mobile device. This will free up resources for many existing projects to focus on smart contracts and web clients while driving adoption for all.
The entirety of the funding will go towards supporting the development of this project, by hiring ~3 frontend mobile developers who will work remotely for a duration of 1 year. Any excess funding will be used to pursue partnerships with additional projects and to support a coordinator role between the mobile app developers and dapp developers.
Roadmap:
1 month: Begin scaffolding out the base layer app, with considerations for an enterprise grade environment, such as staging/production/mock environments, authentication and navigation.
3 month: By the end of month three, we will have developed a modular and flexible component library without any strong design decisions so that it can be extended for a variety of brand needs and use cases in the future.
6 month: In 6 months time we will have integrated the components into the first version of the application for our first dapp partner (a ticket marketplace), set up continuous deployment and integration, and ship the first version of the client to the iOS and Android app stores. We will also have extended the basic architecture of the app for considerations such as accessibility, integrated it with the backend services to talk to the smart contracts and communicate data between the client and the server.
12 months: By month 12 we will have iterated and expanded on the initial design and feature set of the first partner app (ticket marketplace), as well as expanded documentation for the basic application framework and component library, including providing an open source repository for other Cardano Dapp projects to leverage to get their project on mobile quicker. Important to note is the same basic app architecture can also be used to make native apps on apple WatchOS, macOS, Windows, and a variety of smart TV operating systems such as Samsung Tizen and AndroidTV. It will also support reverse compiling into web apps, allowing teams to potentially use just one code base to ship a native client to almost any operating system widely used today. The first app should launch around June 2022, with the open source framework being available to others by December 2022.
Success for this project will be to partner with at least one existing Cardano project and working with them to bring a mobile application to market (we already have identified a potential initial partner, a ticket marketplace and exchange, which is also seeking funding in this round), while creating a basic framework that can be reused for other partners in the future. Our primary KPI will be to release one well-designed, accessible, performant and user-friendly cross-platform (iOS and android) app for a partner Dapp project. Our secondary KPI will be to form a second partnership and develop documentation for other projects to easily leverage the work we have done, by open-sourcing the foundation of the initial app to bring subsequent projects to market on iOS and android quicker and more easily, with many edge cases and enterprise production environment considerations already handled. We expect the secondary KPI to be hit in the 12 month timeframe, after we successfully ship version one of the first partner project. We believe this will impact the Cardano ecosystem by removing much of the redundant work required to make an enterprise grade native mobile client application, helping the ecosystem to be reached by more people, with more projects much faster. By leveraging our experience to provide this foundation to others we can grow the community faster and provide higher quality mobile apps as an ecosystem with less total resources.

Procedural 3D-modeling/level editor framework to assist game-devs building a new generation of distributed community-based blockchain-games!",4,"Friday, 20 August 2021 13:58",Mike D,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Mike-D/3083966-48088,hungryproton,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/hungryproton/3104083-48088,60000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We want to push the development of one easy-to-use framework for the most-intuitive low poly 3D-level editor on top of the Godot engine, the most advanced open source game engine out there. We think that distributed content creation for blockchain-applications is a huge use case for metadata and NFT's. 
We take existing solutions and make them accessible for the broader developer community. HungryProton is the developer of Godot's infamous ProtonGraph and Scatter extensions, which are non-destructive procedural modeling tools. We will leverage this already existing technology and turn it into a framework for a fully-fledged 3D-level editor that utilizes blockchain metadata. This enables users to create their own content, levels and assets like characters.
This proposal is deeply connected to another proposal, which strives to become a game-based play-to-learn-and-earn platform. Check it out here:
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Play-to-learn-and-earn-DID-Platform/367037-48088
 
We create a standard to serialize and replicate the state of 3D-models and levels for video games and applications in blockchain metadata.
The Godot engine is written in C++ and mostly uses GDScript, its own language made specifically for developing games. We want to use their GDNative API to extend the engine and build an intuitive level editor with Plutus functionalities. For this, we might need to update the Haskell bindings. We would like to use Haskell and Plutus wherever feasible.
 
We make use of procedural modeling for abstracting the construction logic of models and functionalities. Constructing a level is done by using different procedural brushes, e.g. one brush has the logic for the construction of a house stored inside it – roof is on the top, floor on the ground, walls on four+ connected sides, door on ground-level and some windows dependent on the number of stories. You can immediately start building your house, clicking and painting your vision, while the algorithm does most of the work in the background. To have sufficient variability, every brush has different seeds for different configurations of your wanted creation.
 
Inspired by projects like Dreams and Minecraft, we want the editor to be game-based as well – it is of paramount importance for the editor's interface to streamline decision and creation processes. This is achieved by using blueprints and answering simple questionnaires, upon which the editor finds the most suitable blueprint to edit for your needs.
Game developers need to be able to customize the framework to suit their own game design. Important adaptable parts are the HUD, brushes for creation of standard content and additional functionalities.
 
We want to either create or integrate with an existing asset marketplace, connecting fellow developers. It would be great to connect smart contracts and NFTs to store 3D-models and regulate optional monetization.
The editor needs to have these core functionalities:

character design + rigging
animation
terrain shaping
asset placement/access to asset marketplace
text placement/voice recording/sounds/video
interaction handling

The editor needs brushes for all kinds of commonly used models and assets. These are houses, structures, trees, caves, streets, plantation in general, characters, clouds, water, clothing, etc.
 
Market: The global gaming market had a value of around 167 billion dollars in 2020. Games like Roblox or Fortnite, that also offer user-generated content and an own in-game economy/currency, report several hundred million monthly active users.
Creating tools for game devs expands Cardano's utility as one of the best choices for upcoming blockchain games. Godot engine has a big and open community of developers and game lovers. In creating the framework, we open up Godot developers to build on top of Cardano.

Three months:  Rough MVP, which includes being able to place items in an empty editor and replicate its state through reading transaction metadata.
Six months:  Advanced procedural modeling capabilities. Connect the test versions of the editor framework and the learning-platform.
IP:
We love open-source, thus we will make every part of the platform and every line of code MIT-licensed and therefore accessible to the community, bringing the most value to the ecosystem. We want to create resources to achieve great things together.
What does success look like?
Future game-devs in the Cardano ecosystem have a blockchain-integrated, working level editor to found a new generation of distributed, community-based sandbox-games. This will make Cardano an even more attractive choice for game devs, which are setting new standards for collaborative playing and building, adding new use-cases for DLT, NFTs and transaction metadata. The framework was used to enable community members to build content for an innovative game-based learning platform.

We plan to include Cardano Developer lessons in BDU L-EARN, our learn and earn program. 
https://github.com/BlockDevsUnited/learn-and-earn
We already have a vibrant community of teachers and students (mostly Venezuelan), highly motivated to learn and earn. Our main limiter is funding for the rewards.  
 
Planned Developer Lessons, in English and Spanish
We use a combination of existing and original tutorials, to fill in necessary gaps without reinventing the wheel. All lessons are open source. 
 
- Cardano node setup and operation
- Stake pools and stake delegation
- Cardano keys and addresses
- How Ouroboros works
- Writing Marlowe contracts
- Deploying Native Tokens
- More 
 
P2P learning
In our system, developers who have passed a lesson are encouraged to go on and teach others that material. This method is time and cost efficient, and research shows that teachers who are close to the knowledge level of the student, often outperform teachers who are domain experts.
 
Student Projects
In addition to theoretical lessons, there are also practical ones, which require students to create Cardano projects in github repositories, and showcase working code.   
Developer Pathway
In addition to offering standalone lessons, we will also create a developer pathway, with the end goal of helping our students get jobs as Developers in the Cardano ecosystem. Students are incentivized along the entire pathway. 
At the end of the pathway, developers will be required to create a capstone project. This is aimed at showcasing their skills, as well as creating more valuable open source code for the Cardano Ecosystem.
 
Testing & Rewarding
Every lesson contains a quiz, or a lab, in which the student must prove her knowledge in order to earn.  In-demand skills will be rewarded the highest.  Quizzes test theoretical knowledge, while labs test practical know-how. 
Currently tests are performed manually by a trusted teacher from our community. BWe use a sybil resistance strategy where students have to verify with BrightID (https://www.brightid.org/) before receiving rewards. 
We believe that learn and earn incentives provide strong motivation for many to grind through the difficult to learn code required to create Cardano Apps. 
 
Vision
The goal is to find and train talented individuals, especially in economically disadvantaged situations,  who would normally not have the time or resources to pour into learning Cardano Development.  We wish to bring them up to a skill level where they can then start earning money as a Cardano developer!
If you like this proposal, consider supporting us in any way. We welcome your feedback and are open to suggestions.

TANGOCRYPTO
Problem statement:
With the current landscape, the first step to start developing on Cardano is to install a Cardano node and some other dependencies like: Cardano DB Sync, Cardano GraphQL, Cardano Wallet etc. It requires infrastructure management, tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. All these time-consuming tasks are just the first steps to start developing. Deploying a high-available infrastructure can cost around $1000 per month and this can stop developers from starting to build new ideas or growing their products.
We believe that developer APIs are paramount for getting real-world usage. To make Cardano the world's financial operating system, we need easy to use and scalable APIs to build more applications and attract more users. 
 
Describe your solution to the problem:
We'll provide a suite of high-availability APIs and developer tools (SDKs) for fast and reliable access to the Cardano network that requires only minutes to integrate. Our goal is to lower the entry barrier for development on Cardano by providing reliable infrastructure and easy to use API that will allow developers and enterprises to focus on building their business model and growing next-generation software without worrying about infrastructure and operational responsibilities. 
The platform will include a FREE subscription for developers to start building their ideas right away.
Our solution sits on top of Cardano and will provide the following components:

HTTP API
Notify
Monitor
Query Composer 
Data stream

The communication layer will provide access through: 

REST 
Webhooks
Websockets
Email
Mobile Push Notifications
Kafka streams
AWS Kinesis Data Streams

On the application layer developers will be able to interact with Cardano through the following components: 

JS SDK
IOS SDK
Android SDK
Kafka Sink connectors
Kinesis consumer 

Use cases and customers
Our APIs and developer tools (SDKs) can be used to power up a wide range of products like:

Lightweight Wallets
NFT Marketplaces
DEX (Decentralized Exchange)
Oracles
Listing ADA on exchanges
Liquidity providers
DAOs
DeFi Apps
Data platforms and blockchain explorers

 
Relevant Experience
Our team members have experience in different technologies, including backend, web and mobile development, distributed systems and databases, Cloud Architecture and Big Data. We are the Stake Pool Operators (SPO) of the pool TANGO and the developers of cardano-wallet-js (https://github.com/tango-crypto/cardano-wallet-js), a javascript/typescript SDK for Cardano with multiple functionalities. You can use it as a client for the official cardano-wallet and also create Native Tokens and NFTs. Our SDK has several downloads every week using NPM and has been used in other community projects and university assignments. Also, we created a POC in order to showcase some usability of the SDK on this NFT Marketplace: https://www.tokens.tangocrypto.com.

Technical Information
These are architecture patterns and technologies used in the backend system. Serverless, event-driven architecture and single table design is used across all the microservices deployed:

Event-driven and microservice architecture that dynamically scales.
HTTP REST API for all endpoints
Push Notification/Websocket for network notifications and communication.
Combination of SQL and NoSQL databases.
Global CDN and edge caching.

 
Proposal Components
TangoCrypto HTTP REST API
The HTTP REST API (https://www.tangocrypto.com) goal is to make development faster and easier. There is no need for syncing with the blockchain and maintaining complicated setups. No more complex and multiple requests to the blockchain from different entry points, the developers can get all the data they need for transactions, token information and debug, in fewer requests.
Our goal is to provide the most accessible and reliable Cardano infrastructure, freeing companies and developers from the responsibility to maintain complex infrastructures and focus instead on building their business logic and provide value to their customers. 

Enterprise-grade infrastructure: Harness the processing power of our globally distributed cloud-hosted node network. Our API alleviates the friction of maintaining your own compute and storage resources, lowering the barrier to entry for developers and enterprises.
Built for developers: Easy to read documentation and resources to help developers get started quickly.
Gain app insights: Our dashboard provides direct insights about API usage. Drill down into specific request methods and get response times, most used endpoints, usage by time of the day, IP address, countries, and more. These insights are a great way to optimize applications based on user behavior.
Standard Interface: Supports Mainnet and Testnet via client-compatible REST API over HTTPS.
Always Online: Running on the latest network upgrades with a minimum 99.9% uptime guarantee.

 
TangoCrypto Notify
With Notify (https://www.tangocrypto.com/notify.html) developers will be able to integrate production-ready notifications with our webhooks and SDKs integrations. Get access to all of the blockchain events your users might care about, like successful transactions, payments, minted blocks by a pool, new delegations. 

Payments and transactions: This allows sending notifications to users to know when their deposits, purchases, in-game actions, or other on-chain activity has officially occurred.
Address Activity Webhooks: Let your users know when transaction activity occurs on their address. No more refreshing the page or having to use the dust to identify a payment.
Smart Retries: Sometimes receiving endpoints fails or hangs more often than you think. That's why we provide automatic retries to ensure deliverability.
Monitoring and debug: We log every triggered webhook so you can monitor their deliverability to different endpoints, disable failing ones and notify your customers.
Development experience: Offer your users a great developer experience, including the ability to test and inspect their webhooks.

 
Tangocrypto Monitor
It's a monitoring and observability service built for developers and the operation team. It provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of the operational health of the apps. It can be used to detect anomalous behaviour, set alarms, visualize metrics, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.

Observability on a single dashboard: Monitor key metrics for apps, including requests per second, webhook utilization, error rate and response time. Explore, analyze, and visualize your requests and efficiently troubleshoot operational problems.
Usage Analysis: Review specific app usage over time, identify access patterns and optimize user experience based on most performed actions.
Geographic distribution: Gain invaluable insights on user behavior with aggregated geographic, traffic, and activity data without compromising privacy or security.
Alerts and reports: Receive automated alerts through email or SMS based on predefined thresholds. Stay informed and be proactive by getting a daily or monthly report of key health metrics.

 
TangoCrypto Query Composer
Make API calls directly from the dashboard in order to prototype and fix failing requests or explore the behavior of new methods. Rapidly prototype and fix requests to the blockchain and save hours of engineering time in the process.

Zero set-ups: Works straight from the browser, just create a free account and start using it.
Quicky debug: Replay requests from anywhere in the dashboard, and save hours of debugging and building time.
Explore: Select from several API endpoints. Test out pre-filled methods from the docs anytime.
Share results with your teammates: Copy the entire request body with one click to share with teammates, collaborate, or get help.
Generate code snippets: Generate client code to API calls in different programming languages and frameworks. 

 
Roadmap
All the functionalities described here will be valid for both Mainnet and Testnet.
First month:
Users will be able to register/login and perform the basic operations (CRUD) for apps and webhooks.
REST API endpoints:

GET address details: Include balance and assets
GET address utxos: Include assets
SUBMIT transactions: Passing the transaction's CBOR Hex
GET Wallet stake: Total controlled stake, rewards sum, withdraw available etc
GET Pool metadata: Pool id, url, name, description etc
GET Epoch parameters: Min fee, key deposit, pool deposit etc
GET Transaction utxos: inputs/outputs utxos
GET Transaction metadata: json metadata
GET Transaction info: Information like: size, fees, ADA and assets amount, etc
GET Asset: Asset's policy, name, quantity etc
GET Block info: Information like: txs count, stake pool minted, epoch, etc
GET Latest block: Latest block info

Second month:
Webhooks notifications:

Transactions: get notified on each new transaction
Payments: get notified on new payments filtered by user rules, so you can for example target specific addresses
Block: get notified on new blocks filtered by user rules, so you can for example target Stake Pools' blocks
Epoch: get notification on each new epoch
Delegation: get notified on new delegations filtered by user rules, so you can for example target Stake Pools' delegations

User admin dashboard with analytics:

Notify: handle all Webhooks offered by the system, CRUD functions.
Monitor: get an insight about your resources and actions
Query Composer: CRUD, import/export your own query to test all API endpoints.

 
Third month:
Integration with the Open Source SDKs. The SDKs will integrate all the HTTP REST API endpoints and the Websockets. It will allow developers to send real-time push notifications to users for engagement and critical events.

Javascript SDK
iOS SDK: Swift
Android SDK: Java/Kotlin

It will support sending push notifications to Android and iOS apps using separate channels for the following push notification services:

Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
Apple Push Notification service (APNs)
Baidu Cloud Push
Amazon Device Messaging (ADM)

We will provide extensive documentation with best practices (e.g. OpenAPI specification for all HTTP endpoints), use cases, and examples in English and Spanish. 
 
Key Performance Indicators for the first 3 months (KPIs)
Acquiring customers:

500+ users free tier
100-200 paid users

*This is an AI workload, it doesn't provide AI services*
*For DeFi/CeFi*
1. If you want your $ADA to spend like money, then we NEED this system.
2. If you want to leverage your crypto as an asset for a FIAT loan, then we NEED this system.
3. If you want interface with the legacy world for wallets and dApps and hold this ground as OURS, then we NEED this system.
-A cluster of 7-10 DGX A100s (located around the world in various TelCom centers) is the BEST solution for Layer 2 Sidechain architecture in terms of power, cost, and scalability. These will be used to build the Not-For-Profit InFinichAIn (re: InExchange) sidechain.
I'm asking for funding for 1 DGX A100 in hopes it will grow by launch.
-Funds will be staked with an escrow wallet held by the CF until project launch, which should be shortly after Fund 5 Governance completes.
- Just in case anyone thinks I'm doing this just to get more funding for this project: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/DeFi-CeFi-Cardano-TBC-in-Fund-5/333834-48088 , you are correct. I'm also trying to make us compete with the entire legacy financial world on a budget that's about 1/2 of what it takes to open 1 McDonalds.-This will literally handle 90 % of financial information and data services transactions coming on and off the network. This is where we can host a decentralized social media platform, it will host a DEX, Oracle, Stablecoins, FIAT, leveraging ADA for FIAT loans, $ADA/FIAT on-off ramp, and anything else we throw at it, as it is a Deep Learning model and gets smarter daily.
-I contacted IOHK legal and they are waiting for me to receive funding before we proceed, but I gave my intention to hire IOHK for the software mods and it was well received. (*3/16/21 Coinbase listing occured two weeks to the day from Letter of Intent. See attachments)
-While no project is ""guaranteed"", this is built upon the bedrock of Mr. Hoskinson's work.
Projected Timeline:
Three months after Ouroborus Omega/Hydra ships, the first unit will be in a datacenter strategically chosen by Catalyst Swarm and Circles.
Six Months the first integrations should be full online.
- My role is Systems Architect and Project Manager.
- The reason that IOHK didn't do this themselves is it legally requires a third-party without prior involvement for execution.
- I've attached an early iteration overview for the project to the comments.
I have a solution to the Gordian Knot (see attached)

MOA=Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota U.S.
CCC=Cardano Creative Commons, Bloomington, Minnesota U.S.
 
The Big Picture:
5 Year Objective:

""Level-up"" Value-Flow Entrepreneurs with skills to leverage the power of the Cardano Ecosystem to create streams of wealth.

 

Create a highly incentivized knowledge and skill sharing culture beginning in pre-school, thus teaching children how to be life-long information and skills sharers.

 

Elevate the role of teaching through innovation and radical incentivization, massively reducing the need for property taxes.

 

Empower in-line taxation of goods with immediate transfer of tax revenue to tax receiving body, thus eliminating the need for the IRS in the United States and the need for self-sovereign labor-for-currency trade seizure in the form of ""income tax"".

 

Streamline government spending by increasing transparency, accountability and efficiency through integration of smart contracts and innovating automation.

 

Empower peer-to-peer commerce, thus eliminating friction and value slippage via opaque and inefficient systems formerly protected by walled gardens of graft and corruption in banking, insurance, food production, real estate, education etc.

 
Action Now:
Starting With Cultivating Developer Community...
1. General Spacial Design of The Work, Live, Play Complex: DLRGroup. Complete design would come after successful implementation and signing of ""ADA Influencer"" smart contract with ADA Influencer(s). (Same design group who developed the approved water park and who have been involved in all development stages of MOA)
 
2. Provide WLP Complex design oversight by a seasoned professional construction officer with over 23 years of hands on top-level management experience (building major hospitals).
 
3. Use the designs to secure an MOU with Cardano Ecosystem ""ADA Influencers"" to construct a highly incentivized tokenomics plan, including the creation of x number of additional stake pools and integration of smart contract guaranteeing delegation for years option in exchange for highest ADA loyalty rewards based off of revenue from the Accelerator Portal Ride, ""Gift/Gratitude"" smart contract value-flow code inserted into Cardano Multiversity Members' smart contracts and the smart contracts of CCC Incubators. CCC delegators will effectively be able to enjoy value-flow from the projects of all Life-Long Multiversity Members and CCC incubated projects including but not limited to distributed finance, insurance, healthcare, food production and distribution, education, real estate, government automation etc.
To achieve this accelerated objective, Cardano Creative Commons has developed a strategy to leverage a 40 million in person visitors per year traffic stream to Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota by first designing a phenomenally functional:
• Onboard
• Educate
• Incubate
Work, Live, Play Accelerator Portal Complex
Cardano Creative Commons (CCC) @ Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota U.S. would become a multi-story Work, Live, Play complex connected by skyway to a $300M water park (already separately, fully funded and approved; breaking ground spring 2022). The Mall of America, including the water park is the largest mall in North America. Currently, MOA receives over 40 million visitors per year not counting an additional estimated 800,000 visitors per year to the water park.
 
*************BIGGEST TAKEAWAY***************
The ""GUARANTEED DELEGATION FOR YEARS"" SMART CONTRACT will create enormous project confidence among tag-along smart contract bound stake pool delegators at the highest loyalty rewards as well as confidence created by standard delegators with opportunity-risk-matched loyalty rewards as the project will be virtually GUARANTEED 100% ADA REWARDS FOR YEARS FOR CCC!!! This guaranteed rewards flow will be collateralized for short term financing to build project and generate immediate cash flow upon completion via the ""Cardano Accelerator Portal"" ride, apartment rent and long term smart contract value-flow from Multiversity Alumni and incubation projects from sample projects listed above and others.
**********************************************
                            Cardano Creative Commons (CCC) Comprehensive Facility Walk-Through
Onboard: ""Cardano Accelerator Portal"" ride
Let's start with the facility as a whole and then work our way up from the ground floor, while moving from physical-local to virtual-global. First, lets create a common orientation. Checkout the aerial photo of the water park and the adjacent parking facility connected via a skyway on the left of the main proposal photo. The skyway would be the approach to the top of an escalator leading directly to the ""Cardano Accelerator Portal"" (CAP) ride where the water park parking illustration is on the left-hand side of the photo. As the MOA visitors walk through the skyway towards the CAP they will be visually engaged via a video playing within the CAP lobby but visible from the frame of the skyway ""tunnel-vision"" with a gradual reveal of a larger screen as the visitor approaches. The top of the escalator is the ""event horizon"" drawing the visitor into the Cardano ""Accelerator Portal"" onboarding experience. As the visitor descends, more is revealed encouraging the visitor to become a curious explorer of possibilities with visual previews of what to expect. The story begins even before tickets are purchased.
The estimated maximum throughput per hour as currently anticipated according to ride designer Cavu is 1,280 riders/hour maximum capacity at roughly $20/rider with a fraction of the riders choosing the post show ""Multiversity Portal"" experience.
(See and VOTE  for: ""CCC:PRISM RIDE @MOA; 40M Visits/yr"" https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CCC-PRISM-RIDE-@MOA-40M-Visits-yr/366834-48088 )
Once tickets purchased, there are three principal components:
• Pre-Show
o Pre-show sets the stage regarding the adventure, establishing the ""why"", the quest and the anticipated reward. Riders will be prompted to download Atala PRISM to complete the ride experience. They will be entertained and engaged as they are invited to tap into the wealth creating possibilities of building a credentials portfolio and using it to unlock new opportunities.
• Show
o The actual ride will be a state-of-the-art virtual reality, motion-based ride with custom accelerator portal vehicles which will enable participants to leap dimensions and ""experience"" Cardano while gathering the credentials they need to ascend to the Cardano Multiversity. Upon completion of the ride experience, the riders will have earned a credentials badge which they will add to their Atala PRISM credentials portfolio indicating they are ""Cardano Multiversity: Leap Ready"".
• Post Show
o The ACTUAL LEAP
o The QRCode for the badge they stored within their credentials wallet will allow them to access the literal Multiversity Portal within the post show transporter room with their first name appearing above their leap station.
o There will be a flurry of activity prompting those who have their ""Leap Ready"" badge to ""Stand-By To Leap!""
o ""Lock Leapers!""
o Via special visual and audio effects, it will appear the rider disappeared while they were actually raised to the 2nd floor Cardano Multiversity by an invisible ""deus ex machina"" / robotic arm.
o Those who have taken the leap of faith may watch a looped informational video presentation in a theatre setting with an in-depth description of what Cardano Multiversity has to offer in-person and online including the Cardano Multiversity Experience, Value-Flow Entrepreneurialism/Wealth Stream Creation and how to join the work, Live, Play community at Cardano Creative Commons, Mall of America.
(The actual flow of the show and determining factors of who leaps {self-selected? some or all?} to ""Cardano Multiversity"" and who doesn't is to be determined.)
Note: A separate Work, Live, Play residential visitors lobby would be on the north-east corner of the building entering from 24th Ave S. Also included in residential amenities would be a health club, yoga studio, float spa and sauna as well as a larger general community room and sky club room on the top floor with views of jets taking off from MSP just a few blocks away.
Hidden from public view, underground with controlled access will be a physically, electrically, hydrostatically, hydraulically and magnetically hardened state of the art network operating center ""Cardano Cloud"" ""disaster proof"" hosting facility completely dedicated to supporting onboard, educate, incubate accelerated value-flow Cardano ecosystem. Network Operators could live onsite in the residential portion of the building, with 24/7/365 onsite support.
Educate: Cardano Multiversity
(See and VOTE  for: ""CCC: Cardano Multiversity MVP"" https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CCC-Cardano-Multiversity-MVP/366734-48088 )
2nd Floor: Cardano Multiversity will be the physical manifestation of the virtual education opportunities available to every connected human on the planet. It will also house state of the art in person, synchronous and asynchronous distance learning hybrid spaces, live streaming and content creation ""co-labs"" including social media synchronized and automated multiplatform simulcasting. The local community and traveling learners will have access to Cardano Education Professionals who are committed to accelerated onboarding, education and facilitating incubation and connecting those with skills to those who need skilled Cardano Professionals for their projects.
Incubate: Globally Connected Coworking
(See and VOTE  for: ""CCC: Reset Ready?|Value-Flow Wealth"" https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/CCC-Reset-Ready-Value-Flow-Wealth/366817-48088 [Onboard, Educate and Incubate Businesses] )
3rd Floor: Incubator will be the most forward-thinking coworking spaces available just blocks south of the Minneapolis Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). The acceleration objective will be met by introducing newly Cardano certified professionals with those who are actively incubating projects. The freedom and sovereignty of individuals will be enhanced by offering maximum flexibility to create one's own work-life balance by working how when and where an individual wants without having to travel to work for those who reside at Work|Live|Play @ Cardano Creative Commons, Mall of America.
4th Floor and up. Depending upon financing, we could build as high as 94 ft or what the FAA or airport commission will allow. Living connected to Mall of America and the water park provides a climate-controlled space to stretch your legs, shop, dine, play and just decompress. Every day for 2 hours before stores are open in MOA, the mall is wide open and very peaceful for morning walkers to get their steps in surrounded by trees, pools, fountains and massive amounts of natural light via skylights. Anyone who is actively engaged with the Cardano ecosystem will be able to engage and disengage at will, take a nap, workout, swim, livestream, study, collaborate whenever and wherever they please and for as long as they wish, taking breaks when they want/need to.
Financing
Cardano Creative Commons cash-flow strategy is very unique and is based completely upon a conceptual incentivized accelerated stake pool saturation ""Giving-Gratitude"" smart contract loyalty rewards program. With our strategy there would be no need to offer equity and any debt could be retired relatively quickly due to our mix of incentivized ""Guaranteed Delegation For Term/Years"" option.
Example: Let's say ""ADA Influencers"" opted to delegate 10M ADA to 10 stake pools for 5 years via a ""Gift/Gratitude"" smart contract in exchange for a loyalty rewards token which will ultimately be used to calculate loyalty rewards to be paid in ADA based on the revenue generated from ride sales and smart contract income from Multiversity Community Member Members and incubated projects. The guaranteed delegator commitment would attract other delegators whose loyalty rewards would be reflected by their loyalty as measured by their commitment to the Cardano Creative Commons project and for how long. If ""ADA Influencers"" stepped forward, the CCC facility could be designed and proposed to the City of Bloomington for inclusion in the 2022 ground breaking of the water park across the street AND CCC would be eligible for a $5 million TIF flexibility grant. The 10M ADA guaranteed delegation per stake pool would build ethos among potential interested delegators and would build momentum for increased and ongoing support for the CCC project. The city would have a globally connected school and a showcase facility to win over the global site selection committee for the 2027 World Expo. Bloomington finished in the top 3 sites worldwide for the 2023 World Expo.
Key Performance Indicators:
Designer created common reference designs to contribute to facility scope, time-frame and financing dialogue
Key construction stakeholders engaged
Dates set to meet with City of Bloomington for approval and potential $5 million TIF financing cash contribution to project
IOG and Cardano Foundation engaged to transform from concept to reality

Cardano Creative Commons (CCC) is seeking funding to explore the creation of a global, value-flow loyalty rewards methodology which formalizes stake pool delegator reward distribution to those who have contributed to systemic value-flow via a purpose driven stake pool, specifically the CCC stake pool. Simply put, think of a lawnmower with a pull-cord attached to a flywheel. It takes a significant amount of energy to start the lawnmower for the mower to run continuously. Delegators in this analogy provide flywheel source energy (FSE) to start the value-flow machine / torus / ""Accelerator Portal"".
Smart contract, incentivized stake pool delegation will play a key role in developing and deploying self-sustaining Developer Ecosystem. The intent is to transition from external incentivization to a closed loop system which will grow as the Developer Ecosystem matures while rewarding loyal community members weighted by first consecutive ADA delegation epoch to current date, current delegation/epoch and total amount of CCC native asset staked on CCC stake pool.
Not only will this project breathe life into Cardano Creative Commons which has the potential to become a global Decentralized Autonomous Organization with regional ""Accelerator Portals,"" funding this project directly feeds SPOCRA's ability to serve new and existing stake pool operators by providing a model and opportunities for stake pool(s) as a service (SPaaS).
Toroidal value-flow is self-sustaining:
• Delegators are incentivized by loyalty rewards and directly supporting pools funding the Developer Ecosystem Accelerator Portal.
• Creative developer & entrepreneurial talent outside of the Cardano ecosystem is attracted in by opportunities allowing them to focus on business value they can generate.
The cornerstone of kickstarting the toroidal value-flow is the creation of a development accelerator stake pool operation and a delegator loyalty rewards program using a custom native token and smart contracts.
CCC stake pools will be established as purpose driven stake pools in support of the CCC mission. Delegator rewards will provide the primary FSE which may be signed securely via stake pool owner held private stake pool keys.
The funds requested will in part finance the startup & operation costs and compensation to the designated stake pool operator for the running of the CCC stake pool(s).
Project: Step by Step
1. Setup of a high security enterprise level i.e., following all SPOCRA standards, stake pool operation whereby the owner and the operator have established a best practice method for key management.
2. A CCC enterprise level stake pool operation with proper monitoring and maintenance practices being followed to ensure consistent block production will be established. Additional stake pools will be added as previously created stake pools become saturated by ADA delegation.
3. Host a hybrid live/live-streamed global summit along with Minnesota business, government and education ""pre-onboarded"" invitees. On-boarding event for initial delegators providing the FSE to kick-start the toroidal value-flow machine.
4. Whitepaper outlining the incentivized smart contracts and tokenomics system. Submit for peer review and collect Cardano community feedback, including input from SPOCRA.
5. Minting of a native asset.
6. Write and formalize an incentivized delegation smart contract which rewards ADA delegation weighted by combined epoch start date and sustained delegation over time with a native asset which will be used to calculate loyalty rewards from a designated loyalty rewards pool to be denominated in ADA and based on global value-flow flowing back to CCC via network members' smart contract agreements.
Definition of Success:
Success will be measured by active implementation of functioning stake pool loyalty rewards program running on all CCC stake pools within 3 months of funding.
Budget:
$48,000 for Tunheim planning, website and creative for ""on-boarding"" event to ""green-light ready"" phase,
$32,000 for SPaaS setup, operation and smart contract creation, development of loyalty rewards architecture, community input integration, initial deployment, monitoring, documentation, and project management is as follows

$3,000 – setup & operation costs of initial CCC for 3 months
$29,000 - compensation for completion of incentivized smart contract development work and modeling & peer review of end-to-end value-flow tokenomics to and from stake pool delegators

$10,000 CCC/ Gary Heyer Project Management
Auditability:
The number of participants going through experience, total revenue generation, number of on-boarded individuals/ projects started, etc.
Smart contracts created to facilitate the toroidal value-flow networks can be audited.
IP: All global methods created by CCC or SPOCRA will be publicly available. Specific implementation, partnership or allocation agreements may remain private. If any IOG IP is used, that IP will be subject to IOG IP acceptable use, permissions, and guidelines.

Build standards and a framework that automatically produces true-to-code visuals and let everyone play and simulate DAO features.

Background On the Problem
DAOs are complicated. Not just because of the blockchain, but because of everything not on the blockchain. DAOs are a collection of traditional software, things like websites and servers, AND smart contracts, blockchain wallets, UTXOs.
The interplay between blockchain bits and traditional bits is left out. We don't have a framework that is built for the hybrid world we're entering. One that lets non-coders see the system in its entirety - lets you surf its clusters and edges without getting bogged down in white papers and thousands of lines of code. One that gives developers and participants the assurances that what they build will behave. One that gives auditors and architects alike simple tools to simulate and prove the system is acting as expected.
 
Our Solution
That's the Visual DAO Framework. That's our mission. A three-layer approach to a new generation of services that bridge traditional software with blockchain and brings the whole community along with it.
We will build a Graph DAO framework and standards, co-developed by community programmers, mathematicians, artists, and communicators. A series of open conferences will present concepts and concerns at the beginning of each stage of the roadmap. Final acceptance will be visualization and simulation of the community selected and designed DAO use cases.  Developers will be able to simulate entire DAOs on command or safely split DAOs into modular components for feature testing.
What could make a valid DAO?

A DAO is only valid if it can be represented as a fully connected graph.
A DAO is only valid if it defines its own external interfaces.
A DAO is only valid if it controls its own data.
A DAO is only valid if it can be deployed as described by the graph.
A DAO is only valid if its behavior is as its stakeholders expect.
A DAO is only valid if it can be simulated by its stakeholders.

 
Example Use Cases

Lotteries
Donations
*Choosing member roles
*System permissions handling
Summed systems – Electing people and granting them systems access (yielding API keys, resetting account ownership off-chain)

Community Growth
Growth in users at each layer. Here's how this work might help you:
Voters
Voters primarily interact with the visualization layer. As teams present their work, they can provide generated visualizations and active simulations to stakeholders (you!). Instead of showing a fake bunch of bubbles and lines with a great speech, development teams can present their core DAO logic as it exists in visual form, even demoing it live.
DAO Participants
Individuals participating in the DAO can gain confidence in their interaction (buying stake, sending money, employment, lottery, charity, and more). Visualization allows non-technical participants to explore how their interaction impacts DAO behavior. Community auditors and security researchers peer review the dynamics of proposed DAOs.
Core Developers
Developers will use the framework to piece together their core DAO components. The framework will allow for the quick composition of the trusted (off-chain) and verified (on-chain) components and functionality via intuitive abstractions. Developers connect resource abstractions with strict functional logic and get the benefit of auto visualization, simulation, and deployment planning. Developers can be sure that the deployment targets (on-chain and off-chain interfaces, addresses, and data stores) will be community validated and enterprise-ready where possible.
Artists, Designers
DAOs adhering to the Framework can be fully visualized as connected graphs. These graphs can be rendered in blender, pushed to graph databases, drawn by JavaScript's Mermaid or python's Matplotlib, and more. Data journalists can tell stories of the DAO and its behavior, finding innovative ways to communicate the inner workings of the DAO starting with a valid representation of the core DAO components.
Architects
Software architects and business leaders can translate requirements or UML into graphs directly on the visual layer, creating a wireframe for the development team. As development continues, architects have a way of verifying DAO construction intuitively, against their early visuals. Anyone can simulate the network at any time, so project managers are not in the dark about connectedness, functionality, or performance.
Quality Assurance Specialists
Quality control specialists have multiple ways to validate system behavior and development work. Visually, auditors can check graphs for unwanted leaves – signifying backdoors, insecure interfaces, bad data sources. Because the code is written in a framework, the simulation will fail if not constructed properly – CI/CD gets a boost with the simple simulation of the entire network without standing up heavy infrastructure. The strict nature of the framework means that testing individual edges (executing functions directly) has an easy chain to follow – visually via the graph and code.
 
Roadmap
The core team and consultants engage in development cycles to prepare assets for an event. This helps scope research, ideation, and development as well as provide transparent milestones to the community. All events will be recorded for public viewing.
 
Phase 1 – Ideation, Setup, Workflow (2 Months)
Events:
[CC1] Community Conference: Early Use Cases (picks 3) 8/18/2021
[CC2] Community Conference: Architecture Concepts, Language Selection

Community Development Events
The Cardano community is the ultimate user of Graph DAO, its tooling, and visualizations. We will offer incentives to registrants to garner insight at key steps throughout the conception and buildout of the framework layers. Community development events, community conferences, and working groups, are limited seat scoped events where the core development team will present findings, concepts, and programming patterns and get directed feedback to accelerate decision making and stakeholder alignment. Registration will be first come first serve for interested parties that submit short descriptions of why they would like to join and what they plan to contribute.
 
Community Conferences ~60min (Seating limited to 10)
Community conferences are relaxed, but focused discussions to set design parameters for the Graph DAO framework and review use cases.
Incentive
Prizes will be offered via lottery to participants.
 
Working Groups ~90min (Seating limited to 5)
Working groups are highly engaged focus groups aimed to provide specific feedback on Graph DAO framework assets, construction, and usage. Attendees will be expected to follow instructions to set up development environments and review select materials prior to attendance.
Incentive
Participation fees are equally distributed to all participants.
 
Defining Success
This project can only be successful with the help of the community. We want to involve diverse stakeholders throughout development.

What is Cardol.io?
Cardol.io is building Cardano-focused visual portfolio tracker to enable investors to make informed, actionable decisions. It will be a singular place for investors to track their native assets, staking rewards, NFTs and DeFi products through a personalized dashboard. Insight-focused and analytics-driven, Cardol.io wants to make portfolio management in the Cardano ecosystem intuitive by design.
Why Cardol.io?
The Cardano world is busy. Busy researching, growing and challenging norms every single day. The people invested in Cardano projects are even busier. What's the most valuable thing you can give to busy people? Time. Time for community, time for growth, time for balance. Cardol.io wants to give time back to the Cardano community by removing the manual effort of tracking their Cardano assets and present insights in a visually-digestible format so that they can make decisions quickly
We believe that an informed investor is the best asset. But right now, Cardano investors are facing information overload from a smattering of sources. This doesn't lead to thoughtful, well-researched and planned moves--it leads to moves that are informed by the latest inputs of information an investor receives. The latest news is hardly the whole story. Cardol.io wants to tell the whole story and build an informed community invested in both their own portfolio performance and the network overall.
Cardol.io Planned Features:

Portfolio. Personalised dashboard tracking for your Cardano holdings that consolidates native assets, staking rewards, NFTs and DeFi with visual insights & analyses.
Visual Blockchain Explorer. A visually-driven way to explore the blockchain based on epoch, blocks, transactions and wallets.
Stake Pool Ranking. Rank & visualise stake pools based on delegators, rewards, epochs with blocks, margin and fees to help investors optimise their staking strategy.
NFT Search. Simple, aggregated gallery to search & explore NFTs.
News + Sentiment Analysis. Consolidated new source for Cardano network with sentiment analysis algorithm to pull key insights from new feeds.
OLIO. Governance and utility coin that will be allocated to active community participants for feature suggestion and voting.

Long-term Vision:
We aim to build more than just a dashboard--we want to create and connect a community of Cardano investors, delegators and projects. In order to grow and govern this community, we'll launch our own OLIO token. OLIOs can be used to suggest and vote for new features as well as unlock advanced features like predictive portfolio insights.
Cardol.io Team:
Richard H: Full stack software engineer with 10 years experience working in the fin-tech and ad-tech startup space. 
Michele B: Data engineer and information designer with an MSc in Information Science and 6 years experience wrangling data into insights for companies in North America, Africa and Asia.

Abstract
We have developed a centralized solution on Cardano which offers creation and trading of NFTs - both fixed price and auction based. Also, we have our own revenue share token that's supposed to help finance further development of the platform, while giving the backers 50% of the platform's revenue. We intend to convert the heart of our application to smart contracts and further develop the platform according to our users' needs.
Current functionality
Our app is already live on testnet (https://testnet.cardano.blue/), where we are performing some final tests, while preparing the infrastructure for the mainnet. Currently, it is possible to mint NFTs containing images (jpg, png, gif, etc.) and choose whether you want to receive the NFT to your wallet, put it on sale for a fixed price or start an auction on our platform. All NFTs are created according to the following metadata standard: https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/8b1f2f0900d81d6233e9805442c2b42aa1779d2d/CIP-NFTMetadataStandard.md. It is also possible to trade NFTs created elsewhere, even those which aren't following the standard or containing files other than images.
Beside minting and trading of NFTs, we offer our users the opportunity to support the platform by purchasing CBLU tokens and get revenue share in return. For each token that is purchased, we mint one to our address which always keeps the profits shared 50/50 between the platform and the investors and sets the maximum supply to 352,800 CBLU tokens. Starting price of CBLU token is 1₳ and increases by one for each 420 sold, up to the maximum price of 420₳. Revenue is distributed among token holders on a daily basis.
Technical info
Our backend is comprised of multiple services written in NodeJS with TypeScript, which are using multiple Cardano services to interact with the blockchain. For the client app, we opted for NextJS in order to provide better user experience and search engine optimization. Communication between the frontend and the backend is happening through GraphQL and websockets and the infrastructure is a mix of dedicated servers and AWS services.
The team
Current team consists of two Plutus Pioneers from the first cohort and one front-end developer, but we also have experienced engineers at our company that are already familiar with the project and could join in no time if there's a need to expand the team.
Definition of Success
The main goal for the coming months is to convert present logic to smart contracts. Beside which, we intend to support creation and better UX for NFTs containing files other that images, such as various documents, audio, video, etc. Long-term goals include introduction of governance, which would give the users an opportunity to decide in which direction further development should go, as well as creation of mobile app(s) and constant improvement of the platform's functionality.
After 3 months:

The core of the application logic is ported to smart contracts
The platform supports creation of NFTs containing files other than images - documents, audio, video, etc.
Cardano Blue is number one choice for minting and trading of NFTs on Cardano

After 6 months:

Introduction of governance to the platform
Stable growth of users
Expansion of the development and business team

After 12 months:

Becoming one of the most important NFT platforms
Further development and improvement of the platform according to the community's needs, based on previously developed mechanisms which enable community governance
Developed native mobile applications for Android and iOS

Why Decentralized Health (DeHealth), why now?
There are huge developments in blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent years. DeFi now has lots of useful applications that are now being used by a growing number of people.
On the health side, however, progress has been a bit slow given the challenges. For example, on top of building one's app, one has to consider regulatory compliance, data security, interoperability, and much more which could be time-consuming to do. 
But if there is an existing decentralized Healthcare Infrastructure and Platform integrated with Cardano that devs can utilize, this could accelerate more health apps development.  Developers can focus on building their health apps on top of the platform, saving months and even years of dev time.
 
But building a Healthcare Infrastructure takes years to build!
Right, that is correct. Fortunately, we have started building this healthcare platform called HAPI Hub (short for Healthcare API Hub) since 2016. You can check its comprehensive API services at www.hapihub.com. 
In addition, we also built frontend applications like Electronic Health Records (EHR), Laboratory and Radiology Information Systems, and other health modules. It's called HAPI Cure (also known as www.mycure.md).
 
If they are already built, what else needs to be done?
We plan to further enhance HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure by integrating them in Cardano Blockchain, which adds more security and immutability, enhancing the platform furthermore. This integration module will be called HAPI Chain. 
In our estimation, HAPI Chain will take about 8 to 12 weeks to complete.
 
How is it different from other healthcare apps In blockchain?
Well, aside from its already existing HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure platform, it will utilize the significant developments in Zero-Knowlege (zk) proof, a cryptography protocol, where prover (A) can prove that A knows information X to a verifier (B) without sharing any other knowledge to B other than that A knows X. Having this will address the limitation on scalability, privacy, and auditability.
 
Why is the project called HAPI DAO?
HAPI DAO consists of the three aforementioned products -  HAPI Hub, HAPI Cure, and HAPI Chain. It will adapt the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, popularized and proven to be effective by the likes of MakerDAO and Uniswap. Doing so will help achieve a truly decentralized organizational setup on top of the decentralized ledger provided by the Cardano blockchain.
With such in place, the direction of the organization is directed by the right intentions of the community and not by a central figure. This is especially important for projects like this dealing with people's health records which require utmost security, privacy, and accountability. 
So, what are practical applications?
 

Security & Compliance. Around the globe, there are thousands of health facilities (clinics, health centers, hospitals) that are using Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Many of which are not secure and compliant, meaning the health information of patients is at risk of exposure. HAPI DAO can help in this regard.

 

Availability of Solutions. Many of the health facilities don't even have their own medical records system. HAPI Cure already has available solutions like EHR, LIS, RIS, and other health modules that they can use. 

 

Health App Development. If one is building a health app, there is a high chance it would need a module for user health records storage. Instead of doing this from scratch, it can utilize HAPI DAO's comprehensive API services instead without worrying about data security and compliance.

 

Standards & Interoperability. Existing systems of health facilities have different providers, meaning they are built differently. Integrating HAPI DAO will make it interoperable with other systems as it follows industry-standard protocols. Imagine a whole town, city, or even a nation's health systems interconnected. 

 

Health Information Exchange. A truly decentralized and secure HIE remains elusive, even for advanced countries. But putting Cardano technology + ZK proof with HAPI DAO could ultimately be the holy grail the healthcare industry has long been wanting to achieve. (One great example of this is the Vaccine Passport providers which can use this as a central exchange for validation. In doing so, there would be fewer if no apprehensions at all about data security and privacy.)

Customer submits the pool application with keys needed to run the block producer.
The system automatically creates the staking pool.
Customer makes his own pledge and has to re-upload the keys every 90 days.
Customer receives the rewards and pays our bills.
Customer has the right to relocate the pool any time.

What about wallet private keys?
It is safe for the customers. Our service does not require us to take custody of any customer's keys that allow transfer of funds.
Level of decentralization
We offer multiple geographical locations for the relay nodes. Customers can choose between different locations where we can auto-deploy the relay nodes. With more staking pools deployed, we will add additional relay locations.

Welcome to our Point-of-Sale proposal,
To help spread the word about Cardano ADA and Cardano native tokens, the world must come into contact with this payment method on a regular basis, both In-Person & Online. This will build adoption and uptake around the world.
Website Software
We need more applications that bridge between the Crypto/blockchain world and currently popular website software, that can be easily installed into Websites as components, modules or plugins.
These applications would bridge between PHP code and integrate the code required to talk to the Cardano Blockchain. They would be installed using the standard content management system installer.
Website Creation & Website Builders
Applications need to be built for Popular open-source Website Content Management Systems (CMS) like, Wordpress Drupal, Joomla and Magento, here are the approximate number of websites built on the top 10 Content Management Systems:
WordPress 28,000,000
Wix 4,500,000
Progress Sitefinity 3,100,000
Squarespace 2,500,000
Shopify 1,800,000
Joomla! 1,500,000
GoDaddy Website Builder 1,500,000
Weebly 1,000,000
Blogger 632,000
Drupal 588,000
As you can see there is a large existing market, which work on both computers and mobile devices, where digital payment systems will become required in growing numbers, with the speed and transaction volume of Cardano this will be a good selling point (pun intended!).
Use cases
Applications will be required for these main financial transactions carried out on websites:
Retail payments - so the ability to pay with Cardano tokens at the checkout of an online store, this would require communication between the website component the block chain and of course the user's wallet.
Donations - the ability to accept one-time payments, these may be carried out by offering simple buttons or as part of the checkout procedure.
Subscriptions - Subscriptions would be used for membership sites, software as a service or maybe recurring donations.
Shopping Carts
Payment solutions for a wide a wide range of shopping carts such as Virtuemart, WooCommerce, Opencart, Shopify HikaShop etc. can be written that seamlessly integrate Cardano digital payment facilities.
Website Functionality
In addition to processing payments with Crypto, there are other applications that would be useful such as easy ways to use Blockchain to track stock, deliveries and even activities like recycling using bar codes or QR Codes.
Our proposal is to develop a team within Carl Henry Global to build and distribute the necessary applications through the various repositories.
Retail In-Person Point-of-Sale
As part of this proposal, we would start the research and preparation of plans to launch a viable payment processing method that could be used by retailers of all sizes.
We also envisage the acceptance of multiple Cardano Native Tokens, particularly if there are country specific tokens launched on the exchanges.
Unbanked Retail Point-of-Entry
We will incorporate a facility for the unbanked to use retail shops, cafes etc. to convert their fiat currency into Cardano based tokens that can be used for remittances and online commerce.
If the user is buying items from the business, they will be able to ""over-pay"" with fiat currency, the over payment would be credited to their Cardano wallet. If local laws allow, we could also include a simple ""Cash-Converter"" facility where the retailer would get a fee for accepting fiat and crediting it to their wallet.
We would encourage participating retailers to also accept Cardano ADA and other native tokens for goods & services.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This proposal will utilize Heidrun and Plutus smart contracts to scale out and build up the Adosia IoT profile market. The next frontier of IoT devices is blockchain integration and Cardano is the pioneer.
 
Adosia enables users to create, define and deploy custom WiFi control systems. As of right now, users will need to create their own IoT profiles for these systems. There does not exist a decentralized means to distribute these customized IoT profiles to the masses. If there existed a peer-to-peer IoT profile marketplace then it would help accelerate the proliferation of customized IoT deployments around the world by allowing new IoT user to quickly set up their IoT devices with expert grade configurations. The goal of this proposal is to design the smart contracts required for the marketplace, build IoT smart contract integration, and provide the ability for users to monetize their IoT creations on a decentralized blockchain.
 
How does a P2P IoT marketplace integrate with Cardano?
Every IoT device has nearly endless configurations applicable across a broad range of industries. Each one of these configurations is a customized user-created IoT profile, limited only by the user's imagination.
What we seek to do is to create a monetary marketplace such that these custom configurations could be sold and exchanged on Cardano. Each IoT Profile is textual information which means each configuration and/or configuration hash can be stored on the blockchain. If the information can be stored on the blockchain in an exchangeable way then it can be traded and sold between users on the chain. It will enable a global economic ecosystem around the world providing users with predefined IoT configurations for many different applications.
 
How do IoT devices and Cardano provide value for end-users?
IoT and blockchain will be leveraged by many different industries around the world. The ability to securely and safely integrate these technologies will be an accelerant for the rapid deployment of IoT devices and Cardano adoption around the world. Micro industries of profile creation, data submission, data aggregation and data monetization will materialize allowing end-users to benefit from being able to readily access experts' amazing IoT profiles to satisfy a wide variety of custom applications and requirements.
 
Budget Requirements
 
 - frontend development to build out the marketplace GUI ($5k)
 - backend development to build out the RESTful API for smart contract integration ($11k)
 - lean Haskell development to build out Plutus smart contracts required for the marketplace and IoT device integration ($22k)
 - hardware improvements + new sensors board spin (temp sensor) ($2k)
 
The goal is to build the P2P marketplace by the end of 2021 and a fully-fledged functional product going into the new year.
 
Deliverables
- Decentralized peer-to-peer IoT profile marketplace
- IoT smart contract integration 
- IoT smart contract integration 
 
Target public launch date: 12/31/2021
 
Definitions of success:
- after 3 months the implementation plan will be complete
- after 6 months all technical deliverables will have been met
- after 12 months we would like to see numerous new Adosia applications utilizing the Adosia IoT p2p marketplace
 
Kyle Solomon (FROG / WOLF) is a seasoned Cardano stake pool operator, developer and community contributor, a creator of spacecoins and jetchicken, co-founder of SPOCRA and the founder of the Adosia IoT open hardware project. Quinn (LOGIC) is an extremely talented developer now working full time in the Cardano ecosystem. Quinn and Kyle are both previous Catalyst Fund recipients. All funds will be used for development.
 
Background:
In 2018, having produced functional hardware, Adosia attempted an ICO with the goal of building to this whitepaper:
https://adosia.com/documents/adosia_whitepaper.pdf (new whitepaper coming soon)
Upon being contacted by regulators, Adosia opted to cooperate while moving to build out the Adosia IoT platform without funding - and we managed to build something better than originally intended while preserving the goal of aligning for tokenization on Cardano
Adosia is now a fully functional end-to-end utility application enabling users to create, define and deploy custom WiFi control systems - this requires the user to have minimal hardware experience and zero software development knowledge - most of our customers are using Adosia to deploy (and monitor) custom cultivation and gardening applications - though many are using it for natural gas/smoke detection, motion control, and a variety of hobby applications (motion-activated Christmas tree lights, makeshift security, etc).
 
Enter Cardano:
Adosia's ADO token / Goguen positioning predominantly entails enabling users to sell/monetize their IoT creations within a p2p marketplace via offering packages of ""IoT device operating profiles"" which other users can purchase/license to enable their own open hardware - as one example our Canadian cannabis customers can monetize their cultivation profiles via enabling other customers across the globe to purchase or license their IoT operating profile setups (""data IP"").
Adosia is working to incentivize IoT data submission of potentially useful analog data (moisture levels) and select digital data (such as temperature, humidity, etc) and work to see if that can be monetized via DMP (data marketplace) for sustained revenue post incentive phase.
Adosia's Fund2 proposal, a parallel initiative, entails a core library to sign Cardano transactions locally - so an IoT device itself can perform transactions to purchase such upgrades and profiles - the architecture there would entail the user generating the build transaction server side, then the device pulling that in locally to sign, and then sending out the necessary components for the signed CBOR to be submitted to the chain via a hot cardano node - this component will enable a baseline for broad development to occur within the Arduino ecosystem as well as enable Adosia devices to complete purchases on their own behalf as well as to authenticate themselves within the system.
Adosia is also working to readily modify our platform in a manner to enable any user with a Cardano wallet to trigger IoT actions simply by sending a transaction to a specific Cardano address. For each given IoT device, Adosia users would simply define the Cardano address(es) to monitor, purchase pricing, and 3 bit external IO to trigger (supporting up to 8 products ) for each relevant product item.
 
 
Adosia Heidrun:
Heidrun, originally created to support the Adosia IoT project (Catalyst Fund3 deliverable), is an open source platform API that enables developers a simple self-hosted means to rapidly integrate both accepting Cardano payments as well as add support for user or app initiated Cardano native asset withdrawals directly into custom applications.   Heidrun exists as a standalone node, operates completely independent of smart contracts, and is Cardano ""node-less"" (currently utilizes BlockFrost API).
 
Adosia is currently using Heidrun to:
- accept Ada payments for custom IoT triggering upon Ada payment receipt
- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia SaaS subscriptions
- accept Ada payments for enabling Adosia IoT platform account and device upgrades wit
- accept Ada payments for on-platform ADO token purchases
- accept Ada payments to enable ADO token withdrawals

Right now, animal enthusiasts are active in every corner of the internet. Pet videos, forums, and other community sites are booming. We aim to build a community of animal lovers who share their passion on our Purr-fect Day DApp. 
Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, pet owners have become even more connected to their animals. You can see this trend replicated online.
Although there is a wide range of pet appreciation sites and forums, there isn't a stylized platform for users to share their passion in the same way they do on other sites like Instagram.
The Purr-fect Day DApp will be that platform. It will utilize Cardano's decentralized network to provide a secure, private arena for users to share their interests in animals. Further down the lane, the Cardano network could provide a decentralized method for ad spending and other financial activities. 
 
Roadmap (12-month-plan)

1st-6th month: App development
6th-8th month: Marketing & PR campaigns to promote this app in US market
8th-12th month: Marketing & PR campaigns to promote this app in Asia-Pacific / Euro market

Budget Allocate:

50K for app development
25K for marketing & PR purposes to increase users
20K for creative brand activation for brand loyalty
5K for legal advice 

 
Deliverable:

The first DApp built for animal enthusiasts across the globe, and select the ambassadors from the initial users after the first 2 months with an extra incentive or the privilege of the new feature.
A safer platform for animal lovers to communicate and interact without worry exposing the private information

The goal would be to develop a simple application using smart contracts that would allow people to share some information with emergency services or individuals identified as primary point of contact. This would be not only used when an individual has a health issue (calling 911 for example) but also in situation for which a natural disaster occurs and the person needs to be located quickly.  There is a chance that cell signal could possibly be lost at some point so working on some type of ""ping"" showing last known location if service isn't available would be addressing this issue.  In addition, the application would try to send text message with last known location as it is sometimes easier whilst trying to get a cell signal. This could possibly integrate with other social applications (subject to agreement/authorization) given by the individual
 
Development would range from 8 to 11 months to get the GUI developed and the application coded/tested.

Integrate NFTs and Ikigai Technology's tech stack into a free-to-play card-based mobile fighting game in Unity - Upper/Cut!",17,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 05:21",Michael Yagi,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Michael-Yagi/3069826-48088,Alejandro Hitti,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Alejandro-Hitti/3076420-48088,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Design
Upper/Cut! is a turn-based PVP card game in the style of an arcade fighter. Players will sequence and submit their turns simultaneously, and then watch how each round resolves.
Aside from the turn-based nature of the game, the pace of Upper/Cut! follows the flow of a typical fighting game match. Fighters start in a neutral board state, where they might use zoning tools (in the form of cards) and movement to space themselves in relation to their opponent. Going on the offensive requires substantial risk, but putting pressure on the opponent can put them in a position that limits their defensive options. Finally, the card discount system and ramping mana means that players can fluidly string together powerful combos by playing their cards in the right sequence.
The game is designed to be free-to-play, with premium players paying for cosmetics or early access to new fighters. This monetization will occur through NFT integration. Whereas other NFT-based games fall into the trap of requiring players to pay a significant amount of money upfront, Upper/Cut! can function as a viable alternative model that demonstrates the exciting features of the technology without falling into predatory practices.
NFTs will be tied directly to the type of cosmetics that show up in game. If a user owns an NFT, they may choose to equip alternate card art and animations in the menu between games.
In the long term, the team aims to create cosmetics based on user-submitted content, and split the profits of NFT sales with the artists. Early on, I would hope to commission artists, but as time goes on, allowing users to submit new art to a pool and investing in a pipeline for existing NFT owners to vote which cosmetics get minted as new NFTs could provide interesting avenues for user engagement. Note that the first set of concept art has already been commissioned and completed, although they have not been minted as NFTs yet. An example of the 'Uppercut' card concept art is attached below.
The success of this project in relation to Cardano is easily indicated by several key metrics.
- Total transactions of Upper/Cut! NFTs
- Number of downloads and active players
- Community engagement in the official Discord channel
We hope to officially launch in the latter half of 2022.
The game has a working, playable prototype that was built in Python via Discord's api. See the official game design document below for more information.
The official game is built in Unity using DOTS (data oriented technology stack). The game is server authoritative, and much of the game logic of the server has already been built and implemented. We are aiming to polish the client version of the game, as well as add more art and animation assets to complete the experience. Funds from this Catalyst Round would enable us to directly connect in game cosmetics with NFTs, as well as implement a ""choreographer"" animation system that makes matches feel more dynamic and flashy. In addition, we will use the funds to polish the ui of the client app and make sure the experience is intuitive and pleasant.

Unfortunately, there are many different financial concepts that most people do not understand. The ability to grasp and apply even the most basic concepts about money and managing personal finances is positively a life-changing ""skill"". As more individuals learn about the pitfalls of fractional reserve banking and how to properly manage their money to preserve long-term wealth, it creates a meaningful ripple effect of hope, unity, and power to the people. 
It's time we separate money from state.
When integrated with Cardano, Avocado will introduce every new user directly and natively to ADA and the Cardano Blockchain, including some specific capabilities, such as Atala Prism, ADA/COTI Pay, Project Catalyst, a Cardano light wallet & access to Cardano's DeFi ecosystem.
Think of Avocado as a financially-focused social media platform that connects people who want to share their thoughts and ideas, discuss various topics, and learn from industry leaders. Avocado allows individuals to take charge of their financial future by learning key concepts ""straight from the source"" -> Avocado Official Learning Material and from Businesses, Organizations, Industry Professionals and other Financial Influencers that will provide high quality educational content for their followers.
 
As we grow, core functionalities and features will continue to be built out:
-Follow people and topics you care about. Share content that resonates with you (posts, articles, memes, etc.). Post your own thoughts, images, videos, and other original content your followers might find interesting.
-Public and Private ""Pits"" (think of these as subreddits that support all the various financial interests our users want to discuss with like-minded individuals)
-Buy/Sell/Trade/Swap stocks and crypto assets directly on the platform
-Avocado Official Learning Material. Engaging. Gamified. Learn to Earn.
-NFT ""Badges"" to represent various skillsets, accolades, achievements, and other noteworthy differentiators that deserve social recognition.
 
We are currently in the planning phase of development of our utility and governance token, GUAC, which will be minted on Cardano.
GUAC Token Utility:
-In-App (micro)payments (tips, ""private pits"" (subgroups/rooms), exclusive content)
-Passive Income via Staking, Liquidity Mining LP ADA/GUAC
-Governance Rights (submitting Avocado Improvement Proposals and voting)
-Rewards for actively participating in governance and Avocado Official Learning Material
-Holders get access to discounts, promos, special events, and other exclusive benefits
-More to be added in the future
 
We are seeking assistance from developers and advisors for our Cardano Integration Strategy. We see this as an exciting opportunity to be a first-mover in an untapped market: decentralized social-financial learning and investing. With a working product already, it's now time to integrate the blockchain and DeFi, more specifically the Cardano Blockchain, while continuing to grow the community, improve UI/UX, and add new features and functionalities.
Building on top of Cardano at such an early stage will be synergistic for both platforms. It provides an introduction to blockchain and novel functionality for Avocado users, and, subsequently, brings more ADA holders and DeFi users to the Cardano Ecosystem. All while improving lives through financial literacy.

To fulfill this growing need we propose the creation of a remote blockchain-backed conflict mediation platform. Based on Game Theory for multi-party conflict resolution that would be coded into a Plutus Based Smart contract.
In it, teams that are having internal problems can appeal to the intervention of a third party (the arbitrator) that mediates the dispute. If a resolution has not been found, the dispute can be put to an open vote by selected members of the platform (adjudicators) that will render final judgment over the matter.
The platform is initially thought to service projects in the Cardano ecosystem. But we'll aim to expand around the entire blockchain development space, and finally to the general remote work economy.

If built, our project has the potential to add users to Cardano from across the 1070+ institutions in the U.S. and Canada who are already using our library content.
Background:
Over the past few decades, the price of textbooks have consistently exceeded triple the rate of inflation.1 College students face steep price tags that averages around $625 per semester.2 This has led to institutions to re-negotiate or cancel their relationships with publishers.3 As a result, federal funding for Open Educational Resource (OER) creation with Creative Commons4 licensing keeps increasing, from $5+ million per year in FY18 and FY19 to $7+ million per year for FY20 and FY21.5
While the benefits to students have been myriad6, the current landscape is fragmented and the lack of proper infrastructure has imposed restrictions on both content creation and consumption. Even the most successful open-source communities have encountered obstacles associated with building and maintaining large repositories of content. While some of these hurdles are technical in nature, others are more systemic, pertaining to licensing, attribution, and distribution. Lack of copyright enforcement has led to the exploitation of OER content authors whereby content providers charge students for the use of materials that were intended to be freely accessible.
The number of faculty who are ""very aware"" or ""aware"" of OER and Creative Commons licensing rose to 31 percent in 2018-19, up from 17 percent in 2014-15. At the current rate of increase, it would take another five years before a majority of teaching faculty become ""very aware"" or ""aware"" of OER.7
We believe that recent developments in blockchain technology have the potential to overcome issues with open access content repositories and further accelerate OER awareness and adoption. Our decentralized application (dApp) is designed to underpin a library of STEM educational content that seamlessly connects content creators and learners while simultaneously ensuring that IP consumption follows the creator's desired licensing structure, all the while providing transparent accounting for every transaction. This will disrupt the current system of exploitation.
Some of our expected customers are already using materials from the library of STEM educational content that our dApp aims to supplant. These include
--academic institutions, of which there are more than 1070 in the U.S. and Canada7 and
--content management systems (CMS) and other providers of STEM educational content.
Our platform will open up a new virtual economy for educators, students, and the content distributors who facilitate interactions with educational content. Providers using our dApp will benefit by their ability to more easily identify and contract content authors and by having access to fresh content. This will allow them to enhance their course offerings and thus expand their own customer base.
Our dApp has the potential to transform how STEM content authors are compensated, recognized and share their content. Our dApp marketplace will increase the options for creator funding and royalties. We are long-term open-source community contributors, and we are committed to donating a portion of our revenue stream coming from sub-licensing this open content directly back to The WeBWorK Project7 (TWP). These donations support code camps, authoring workshops and other community events.
Students will benefit from low-cost access to a wide variety of high-quality STEM content authored by subject matter experts. Students will also retain ownership and control of the immutable data produced during their interaction with course content.
The availability of filterable, public, anonymized data and secure, private, individual records will prove invaluable for researchers and students alike. If successful, our project has the potential to not only disrupt the current STEM education space, but also the economy surrounding other types of IP assets.
Our smart contracts will allow content authors to create the building blocks for course curricula which will have perfect traceability from creation through to consumption. Smart contracts embedded within individual assets will make it possible for authors to receive proper attribution and compensation, regardless of the means through which it is consumed. Compensation has the potential to take several forms which we anticipate will serve to incentivize work and open up the possibility of a marketplace whereby content experts can be contracted to create fresh materials. On the flip side, content consumers will also have their interactions recorded, allowing them access to their history at any point in time, independent of their status with a particular content provider.
Several components of our system's modular framework are already in various stages of development. The WeBWorK content renderer has already been released. Our team is currently in development on the web 2.0 library database and UI, which will transition from database to dApp during the course of our project. And initial integration with CMS is currently underway with several providers. The dApp itself is currently in the design stage and we hope to begin development with your support.
3 months:
--Develop and deploy smart contracts
--Migrate existing 50,000+ assets onto the blockchain
--Integrate existing Content Management System with dApp
6 months: ready for pilot, hit performance and load benchmarks
--Optimization of round-trip performance. We are introducing additional tasks into the request-render-response cycle, and it is imperative that we minimize their impact on response latency.
--Operating at scale. Product launch!! Partners will begin using dApp.
12 months: optimizations and internal economy
--Economic modeling. Value entering our economy is measured differently than our expected compensation structure. How do we navigate between value-per-user and value-per use?
Our IP counsel, the firm of Wolf Greenfield, will support this project by 1) reviewing the structure for our sub-licensing model so as to ensure completeness and legality and 2) guiding us in writing a provisional patent application for our dApp. This project has never been funded.
Budget:
--Pay founders for 6 months to allow them to work on the project: 6 months x $4,000 x 2 = $48,000
--Server costs and other technical infrastructure = $2,000
--Pay for freelance developers - 250 hours @$100/hr = $25,000
Total: $75,000

Problem Description
In developing countries, such as those in Latin America and Africa, fiat currencies are weak and represent a loss of the population's purchasing power, as the monetary policy of Local Governments is not able to curb inflation.
For local merchants, it is not practical to accept ADA as a means of payment for their products and services, as to avoid high volatility they prefer to keep their sales revenues in a stable currency, such as the dollar, or, to operate the business, they need to keep cash in fiat currency.
On the other hand, there is an effervescent pro-crypto movement in countries like Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil, which is perceived in other continents, such as Africa, where people use cryptocurrencies as a store of value (capital protection), but even if they want to and requiring merchants find it difficult to use crypto as a means of payment due to the lack of this option in local retail.
Merchants do not have the time and resources to spend on receiving payment in crypto (b2c) and converting to a stable currency such as the dollar or even a fiat currency, which is commonly a necessity as they depend on a chain of business, such as suppliers and creditors who only use fiat money (b2b).
Solution Description
Development of a dApp for merchants to receive payment in ADA, allowing automatic conversion to stablecoin or fiat currency.
The dApp must allow the merchant to register their products for sale by informing the price in fiat currency/stablecoin, their wallet address and their option to receive (ada, stablecoin or fiat currency); then generate a QRCode for the buyer to scan; the dApp will then display the product price in ADA and the merchant's warehouse address on the smart contract.
At this point, the smart contract will manage the merchant's receiving option:
A) If the merchant chooses to receive payment in ADA, they will be transferred to their wallet;
B) However, if they chooses to receive in stablecoin, the dApp should seek the best price in decentralized exchanges and carry out the exchange, similar to what is done by the well-known dAPP 1inch;
C) If the merchant decides to receive in fiat currency, the dApp will seek the best price on a p2p liquidity provision exchange, connecting the merchant with the p2p trader.
This p2p liquidity provision exchange is an integral part of this solution, and comprises allowing people to register their desire to exchange fiat currency for ADA, stablecoin or any other token tradable on the decentralized exchanges of the Cardano network connected to the dApp.
The transaction will take place between the shopkeeper and the p2p trader, while the smart contract will securely mediate the exchange in the following mechanics:
The liquidity provider sends the fiat currency to the merchant's bank account, which will have a predetermined time to signal whether it has received the payment, if the merchant confirms within the time or time limit is reached, the ADA or token desired by the provider of p2p liquidity is released to your portfolio. However, if the trader informs within the time that he has not received the fiat currency, a dispute opens which will be mediated by 3 mediating agents randomly chosen to verify the supporting documents of the p2p liquidity provider, and then decide whether or not to release the tokens.
In case of need for mediation, the mediators, which can be any person, will receive a spread for the mediation service.
In all three cases, a small spread rate will be deducted for the operationalization of the solution, as well as for the payment of the mediators of the negotiations of the p2p liquidity provision exchange.

Amazon Kindle dominates the ebook market. Having a monopolist position Amazon takes big fees from the writers' rewards (30-70% for a digital product!) and at the same time has other disadvantages: censorship risk (look what they did to Parler!, and I know other examples when the author was banned from Amazon for political or other reasons) and delay with payments (you need to wait few months to collect author royalties).
Cryptocurrency and Cardano can easily solve these problems.
Aregato (prototype name) platforms will very low fees taken from the author (maybe 5% or even 3%), payments will be made almost instantly (buyers will have multiple options to pay, authors will receive payment in ADA and native Cardano-based tokens)
So the program minimum is:
To create a marketplace of electronic books, connect writers, small publishing houses, and readers. To create 1 more site, 1 more dapp which will utilize ADA as payment and will increase the number of transactions and will have both intellectuals to find a new audience and the readers to find books.
Program maximum:
Well, we don't want just to capture some part of ebook market share. Amazon also started with books, but where they are now?
Aregato can become the main Web3 marketplace for all the digital goods (music, cinema, art) and even have bigger convergences with the offline world and the IoT and AI areas.
While growing, Aregato can come to new markets, new geographies, and languages, implement certain features, such as.
1. The social network and blog platform for intellectuals
There might be either your own blog platform with a native token, distributed for rewards, or it can be integrated with existing platforms like Hive, ReadCash, Lbry.
Charles Hoskinson says that he the future for a purpose-driven social networks.
This might become the combination of social network and blog platform for the intellectuals in the broad term of this world: people who like to read and write. Authors could build communities and follower base around their books, ideas, etc.
Example use-case: Ron Paul de-platformed. But his team members kept account on Aregato. He's now active there, and people come and support him, including financial support with ADA, native tokens. There could be certain features, like an easier way to speak with your author if you are his/her supporter, or like in this example - maybe join a political campaign. Merchandise can be sold as well as Ron Paul NFTs, and many things can be invented
2. Investment platform - invest in your favorite digital authors
What if you like and admire some author, but he drinks a lot, and spent all his crypto. But still, you like him and what to support. The author is broke now and he'd rather focus on writing new books than looking for another job. He is sure he has enough supporters like you, so he puts his future book shares for sale (selling 30-40%). This is of course confirmed by a smart-contract written on Marlowe and the details are flexible to setup and protected from future changes by blockchain. Of course, there is always a risk that this writer won't finish his book.
Example use-case: Charles Hoskinson wants to buy new land close to his farm, but he doesn't want to sell his ADA. He announced that he's writing the ""Blockchain Governance"" book and there is a high chance it will become a bestseller. He is selling only 5% of his book shares, but apart from tokenized participation in the future profits, he also puts a feature that everyone who contributed 10K ADA or more will have a special recognition badge during his AMAs and dedicated signed paperback copy.
3. NFTs (Non-fungible tokens)
Example use-case: Maria is an active participant of Aregato, and she also has the talent to draw. She wants to go on vacation, but she doesn't want to sell her staked ADA. She is drawing a collection of NFTs, sells them and a vacation trip is funded.
4. Other types of sales, auctions
Example use-case: I'm sad that my podcast proposal was not supported by you in Project Catalyst and I understand that I need to grow it otherwise, so I try to sell 50% of shares for 100K ADA. But nobody buys. I try other shares-percentages and even use native tokens to advertise - but there is no interest. Then I put the whole channel for sale for 10K ADA in an auction mode, one of SPO who's planning to become active on youtube makes an offer to buy it, then another makes the offer of 12K, and then it's old for 15K.
These are just several examples, how I can see the platform might develop. As I startup we might change our focus. For example, we'll see that surprisingly top-popular language on the platform is French (French writers don't like Amazon ripping them off and there is a strong self-publishing tradition in France and maybe also due to multiple Cardano projects in North Africa). Then we make a focus on the French market, and related integrations (i.e. Atala Prizm integration for payments)
Or maybe we'll notice that books are not doing well, but there is a bigger demand for NFTs or video-on-demand. Then we'll reshape our focus and will return to books later.
So this proposal is a prototype and if you are interested - feel free to join, leave your feedback, and vote.

A telegram bot payment system for quick and low-fee payments for small, everyday items using only Telegram usernames.",2,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 19:59",Nebiyu,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Nebiyu/3070094-48088,endubisnetwork,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/endubisnetwork/3102973-48088,7000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


General Idea
A telegram bot (Endubis Wallet) payment system for quick and low-fee payments for small, everyday items, and storage of ADA. The proposed Telegram bot will be implemented in Ethiopia to provide better p2p buying and easy trading options.
Telegram in Ethiopia
Telegram is one of the most popular communication platforms in Ethiopia, more than WhatsApp and Viber.
Telegram is the most widely used application in Ethiopia. An open-source telegram bot that can be integrated with existing wallets can quickly be adapted for other markets outside of Ethiopia as well.
Features and Requirements
Our Telegram wallet will allow anyone in Ethiopia to easily hold ADA or exchange ADA to local currency. Users will also be able to purchase cryptocurrency with local fiat money (ETB). Overall, buying cryptocurrency can be confusing for many users in Ethiopia, as none of the buying options work in Ethiopia. With the integration with local banks' telegram bots such as @Amole and @telebirr, users in Ethiopia can become verified to purchase cryptocurrency with their local currency within minutes.
Risks

Technical Obstacles: Telegram API Performance Limitations
Industry and Market Risks: upcoming cryptocurrency trading laws in Ethiopia.

Deployment and Marketing
The design of the bot will take approximately 2 weeks and a beta version can be released within 2 months. Initial users will be gathered through promotion in various cryptocurrency Telegram groups and Tech events happening regularly in Addis Ababa. We will expand this through a referral program and various incentives for using their ADA in real-world functions.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Problem Statement:
We need to reforest 90m hectares of land (an area twice the size of Sweden) within the next 10 years to achieve the goal of staying within 1.5 degree increase and risking the entire balance of the global climate (at the most optimistic level).*
Huge forestry projects are tapping institutional investors to fund the necessary acceleration needed to reverse deforestation and reforest the globe. We estimate $900bn is needed to reforest this 90m hectares. The same ROI principles used to entice investors to commit funding can also be used to incentivise the public to join in. However they are currently unable to enter this space as the ticket entry is too high.
 
Solution:
We need not only a blend of tens of thousands of large projects (being carried out by companies like www.terraformation.com where Jeremy works) but also to empower millions of smaller projects globally to reach the scale needed. Until the tech became available, it has been impossible to validate small holder farms and communities who want to contribute - but now the tech can help us do this with reliable components that are needed to help this scale by embedding the financial incentives to create a sustainable economic ecosystem for reforestation. 
 
There are two ways of doing this, one of them has been solved by www.regen.network who have created a token based system for buying and selling carbon credits produced by large reforestation projects. Businesses looking to offset their carbon emissions can purchase the tokens. The blockchain acts as a way of embedding immutable data on the reforestation projects to qualify the projects have validated the claims they have made about the planting they have done and how much it has been valued at. There will inevitably be many more similar platforms as this over time.
 
The other way of doing it is to look at trees as having sovereignty - and treating them individually. First of all, when a tree is planted, it is registered by the planter using an app Treetracker by Greenstand whom we've partnered with (https://greenstand.org/treetracker/treetrackers). When a planter logs a tree, they are immediately paid from the money made by the sale of our NFTree. We can make sure that planters all over the world are paid a fair and equitable wage by building this into the smart contract.
 
When someone buys a newly minted NFTree, This not only allows the average person to become an investor in a tree, but it can support millions of smaller projects that wouldn't qualify as a big project. We propose a platform that can automate the certification of a small tree planting project through a blend of satellite data (GIS remote sensing at certain resolutions), smart phones capturing images of trees being planted and their continual health and growth, and mid level drones between filling in missing data. This data, along with other inputs like species, time stamps, geolocation, and the knowledge of other trees and their health in the vicinity, will give us the data needed to evaluate its carbon credit value. Which can be sold collectively in the voluntary carbon market. Providing an ROI for the people who helped pay to plant it. 
 
This data will be stored on the blockchain and associated to each individual tree which through smart contracts, will have its own economic incentives for people to take care of it and ensure its survival - think of Tesla self driving cars being able to earn money from collecting passengers, and pay for their own fuel/electricity when they need to go charge up. This is the same but for trees who can't go anywhere, so we need people to go to them!
 
By building a marketplace where certified tree planting projects can sell planted trees, we can invite citizens to support the reforestation of the planet AND benefit in the economic upside of carbon capture.
So far we have done research into what is needed and verified that all the tools we need are available to make this happen. We've partnered with www.Space4Good.com to provide remote sensing data, and Treetracker who have API for gathering field data with planters. We'll work with project certification companies like Verra and Gold Standard to maintain high quality reforestation projects. As well as Terraformation who can give us advice on best practices.
Arturo has also built a first version product on Cardano blockchain with a smart contract to mint an NFTree, and the first version basic marketplace to buy and sell the NFTrees.
Roadmap:
3 months: Build MVP
6 months: First pilot complete, validated that citizens can buy real NFTrees in our marketplace
We expect to soft launch this by June 2022 with a working version.
12 months: Working product with several reforestation projects and a secondary marketplace for buying and selling NFTrees functional. 
Breakdown of costs:
The investment needed will be to create a first working prototype integrating partner software to create a robust product. We estimate this to be around $50,000 based on Jeremy's work building apps and websites in one of his previous companies that he sold. We'll need a front end and back end engineer to both work with Arturo Panach (Cardano and smart contracts) to build the marketplace and integrate API functionality for adding the data needed to validate a tree and mint it. As well as a data scientist to help set up and manage our databases. Jeremy will design the wireframe, UI/UX, and graphics for the website as well as manage partnerships and marketing.
 
Front-end: $8,400
Back-end: $12,300
Data scientist: $4,300
Arturo Panach: $10,000 
Jeremy Agnew: $10,000
Hosting and other associated costs for platform development: $5,000

1. Introduction
Every year more and more personal data is getting collected by corporations and governments all around the world. Storage of real identity - wallet pairs in centralized databases poses considerable risks for crypto assets owners. This happens, for example, when a user sends crypto assets from a centralized exchange, such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken, to a personal wallet. There should be an option available for Cardano users to remain pseudonymous or to disconnect their real-world identities from their assets while remaining compliant with the laws of their respective jurisdictions.
While several already existing privacy solutions (e.g., Tornado Cash, Monero, or ZCash) may eventually become accessible on Cardano through cross-chain bridges, using them would be costly and inconvenient for Cardano users. A native private transaction protocol built specifically for Cardano would be a more efficient and practical solution. The protocol we are building relies on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs: it breaks the link between the sender and the receiver of assets on Cardano Blockchain, enabling private transactions. Our dapp called Cardano Mixer will serve as a nice user-friendly frontend for the protocol.
2. Protocol
Here are some technical details about the protocol. For the first version of the protocol, we are using zkSNARK construction by J. Groth, as it still seems to be the overall best choice for this type of application. The dapp UX would be somewhat similar to Tornado Cash: there will be options to choose the mixing amount, to deposit and withdraw crypto assets, to receive anonymity mining rewards, and to generate your transaction report (with different levels of detail). Our protocol, however, is quite different on the backend as Cardano blockchain uses a different accounting model and has a different native programming language. As for the protocol token, our main objectives are maximal decentralization,  sufficient incentives for anonymity miners, and liquidity (the token design is not yet finalized).
The complete description of the protocol will be released as a whitepaper by the end of September (first version). In particular, it will cover

How off-chain and on-chain code of our protocol works;
The specification of deposit/withdrawal transactions;
The specification of the protocol token and our reasoning of why it will stimulate the adoption of the application.

Besides that, we hope the whitepaper and the subsequent source code release on Github will provide useful insights for the developers' community on building smart contracts focused on zero-knowledge in Cardano's EUTXO model.
3. Roadmap
Here is our roadmap (as of August 2021).

September            - Whitepaper release;
October                 - Github initial source code release and testnet deployment;
November             - Trusted setup ceremony and mainnet release;
December             - Implementation of governance mechanisms;
1st quarter 2022  - Release of additional quality of life features.

Expected launch date: before December 1st, 2021.
Definition of success

after 3 months is to have at least 500-700 users participating in the trusted setup ceremony;
after 6 months is for the protocol to be running smoothly with governance and quality of life features such as transaction report generation for compliance purposes;
after 12 months is to grow the userbase into thousands, as we expect there is such demand potential, and to implement integrations with other dapps that could use our privacy features.

4. Budget requirements
Up to 12-15k USD will be reserved for a code audit of the most critical parts of the protocol. Additional audits may be initiated later using the protocol treasury once it is fully up and running.
About 300-500 USD will be directed towards covering the development and maintenance costs (some software, domain acquisition, etc.).
Up to 3k USD will cover the costs of UI design.
Finally, 12-15k USD will be paid to the developers to go full-time on this project (November-December), which should keep us on track in terms of the roadmap and ensure better code quality.
Total requested funds: 30000 USD

Blockchain based community fund pooling where individuals & advisors will be the integral part of the business and follow the fundamental principle of decentralised governance. individuals will be owners of the business they invest in and will be part of every decision.
Community funded treasury to empower the idea & in-turn becomes owners of the business
Ecosystem players
For the ecosystem to operate in an efficient manner three parties are involved:
Lender/individuals
Auditors
Entrepreneur
Entrepreneur : Users holding the de-way coin will be allowed to post their idea, requirement, qualification, their investment in the idea they are proposing and more details.
Lender/individuals: Users holding the de-way coin will get the privilege to participate in ideas posted by the entrepreneur, fund the idea to be a partner and vote in different community activities.
Auditors: Staked de-way coin holders who are community elected to ensure the business is not doing any malpractice, constant auditing of the business. Stake will be slashed if the auditor misbehaves.
 
How does it work
Entrepreneur will present his/her idea, requirement, business model to the community of lenders/individuals. Everyone in the community who wants to support the idea will upvote the idea and pool in money, vet the idea, agree on terms and at the end lock required funds in a smart contract.
Lenders/individuals will be owners of the business in the proportion of their contribution to the pool, let's say a lender's contribution is 10% of the pool so the person will be 10% owner of the business.
Fund release to the entrepreneur
Once the funds needed for the business are locked in the smart contract it will be released to the entrepreneur in parts based on the need and each release of funds should be approved by the lenders who contributed to the business. This will ensure checks and balances in a decentralised manner.
KYC of the user to whom the fund is being released will also be made mandatory, to achieve greater transparency.
 
Daily transaction
Daily business transactions will be supported with the help of point of sale(pos) software which is integrated to blockchain to ensure complete transparency of all transactions.
Preferable payment method
Stable coins will be the preferred method of payment, fiat currency will also be supported at the store POS.
Crypto Payment
Businesses will support ADA as a payment method and owners can choose whether they keep it in ADA or convert it into a stable coin right away.
Revenue Model
Profit & loss will be shared between de-way (lenders and entrepreneurs) on the agreed terms & conditions at the initial stage.
Governance/auditors will be given a percentage of profit which is decided by the community.
De-way will also be part of every business which is hosted on it and a fixed percentage of profit will be shared for de-way maintenance.
 
 
Project Timeline
 6 Months 
- MVP of the product
- Preparation for ICO
1 year 
-First version of the product
-Platform marketing
-Minimum three business listing
 
Project timeline will also be influenced by the launch date of smart contracts on Cardano.
Definition Of Success
De-way will be successful once we have helped entrepreneurs in the underdeveloped and developing economies to materialise their Idea and uplift them to a better social status.
Budget Requirements
Requirement 40,000 to fund below activities or individual for 6 months until MVP is ready,  
4 Developers 6 months

When we are looking to build robust decentralized protocols this centralization is a heavy choke point which must be addressed. This is double so when we move into the realm of building cross-chain bridges between Cardano and other chains.
We will be building a Cardano multisig coordination Solidity smart contract which allows coordinating and creating Cardano multisig transactions using any EVM-compatible chain as a middleware. This will be used as a key part of Milkomeda (https://milkomeda.com) to facilitate moving assets from the M1 sidechain to Cardano mainnet.
This will also provide one of the foundational building blocks for creating decrentalized bridges to any EVM compatible chain. The contracts will be general enough so that one day they could theoretically be used to build more decentralized bridges to Ethereum as well.

Preamble:  First stage would be an assessment of the problem, drawing together input and information from across the space to ascertain more precisely the scale and nature of the problem, and to get an idea which starting point would be likely to deliver the greatest benefits for the community in the shortest time, given the resources.  Then it would be the task to use this information to start to design solutions which align with the vision detailed below.
The vision
Vision is open-minded, but I imagine a solution that includes most of the following in some form :
- provide value for very kind of user from the whole Cardano community, from new users to organisations with functionality to suit: eg basic app could allow checking of addresses to see if they are blacklisted, or reporting of URLs or giving evidence or questioning, and for example lawyers (etc) acting on behalf of the community could use this to make cases, propose rules or enforce.  The level of complexity would depend on needs of user - but important that for the most vulnerable it is lightweight and easy. 
- fully integrable and expandable via APIs etc : different apps/Dapps would be able to use, so that for example payment systems could decide to automatically check for blacklisted addresses, or ""trainer"" apps for people completely new to crypto could get warnings for worrying transactions etc (all configurable by user eg ""new"" users can signpost, while experienced users can choose not to have same protections
- perhaps some kind of reward system which encourages safe use of the system and rewards (honest) reporting, or gamification to educate and inform 
- provides statistics, reports, information on demand (eg  on costs of scams ) and access to relevant resources
- crypto insurance, probably via integration with third-parties or DAO
- ""just works"", non-technical, ease-of-access, and ease-of-use as top priorities
- generally raising awareness and salience of the problem in *and outside* the community, so that everyone can see we are taking this seriously and are tackling it
- linked to different teams who are working on the problem, from various organisations, either directly or by supporting a community concerning itself with all issues pertaining to this
- supporting or including any means or ideas of making scams more difficult to engage in , more highlighted, more obvious and less damaging
- international, independent, fully audit-able and de-centralised approach (naturally) to solutions as much as possible, though able to work with relevant bodies (eg local authorities) where necessary and useful for objectives of the community
- open-source technologies
 
It's important
I very strongly believe that we need to do something on this, and quite urgently, because - aside from the suffering of the unfortunate victims of scammers and criminals in this space - enemies of crypto and regulators will surely take advantage of the climate of fear and distrust to try to damage the space. We need to act now while we still have time and before the whole crypto space is irrecoverably tainted.  The threat increases as scammers and criminals get access to increasingly sophisticated AI (machine-learning) and other technologies, potentially threatening the health and trustworthiness  of the entire eco-system in the eyes of the mainstream (ironically, since blockchains are primarily to solve the issue of trust!). 
 
What could success look like?
Definitions of success will include much greater (and increasing) awareness of scams, more informed users, better-protected users with a number of options, more follow-up (eg enforcement, criminal prosecutions and fund recoveries), (de-centralised) insurance and/or other integrations, making an impact on the (relative) cost of scams to our eco-system, preventing catastrophic events and excessive regulation etc, a healthier eco-system which people feel they can trust, believe in and use safely even if they are not tech specialists (this last part is important- must benefit ordinary, non-technical users).
If successful, this can indirectly help *all* other apps/Dapps in the space by fostering the idea that crypto, and in particular Cardano, can be a responsible and safe space to invest and develop in.
 
There's no shortage of press on the problem eg :

Ideas

For example, your vanity address could end with your name.
For a service provider, why not use a vanity address ending with letters 'thanks'?
Surprise your (girl)friend with a hardware wallet, having the first address end with her/his name!

So many possibilities!
Proof of concept

The following address has a sexy end:
addr1v88l2wgr2nqk97lx6hu92ns94ep855afsvgms7427f9ykcq8ysexy
This address ends with specific 5 letters 'adaly':

How does it work?
Adaly vanity address generator can be run in an offline air-gapped machine. You will get a Ledger passphrase as a result. Passphrase is used with Ledger Nano X or Ledger Nano S to open the wallet with the desired fancy address.
Wallet support
Yoroi, Adalite and Adaly wallets support the Ledger hardware wallets.

Funding will be used to pay for the development of the vanity generator and writing the how-to manual.
Budget
$9,939 Development of the vanity generator
$2,000 Writing of how-to manual
Restrictions


""I do not own a Ledger hardware wallet!""
Consider getting one! Meanwhile, you can access your vanity address at Adaly Wallet by using your 24-word seed phrase. However, we do not recommend it, as it is an unsafe practice to share your seed phrase. Once you have entered your seed phrase into the computer, it is forever unsafe! Adaly Wallet has a security advisory for logins with seed phrase.       


""Can I have the address with my name?""
Most of us can. Some can't. Is your name short enough? Does it have letter 'b', 'i', 'o' in it?
Cardano addresses are encoded with Bech32, therefor do not have all the letters available (for example, it is missing letters 'b', 'i' and 'o'). Some of these letters can be substituted with similar looking numbers (e.g. zero).      


""I don't know how to run the generator!""
We will write a step-by-step manual guiding you through the process safely.     


Definition of Success
Product is shared with the public before 3/6/12 months.
Final product
If successful, the vanity generator will be shared December 15th 2021 through a GitHub and posted on the 'Adaly Wallet' Twitter account.

Create a Gamified (RPG-like) Task Management System using the Cardano Blockchain similar to Habitica - https://habitica.com",2,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 14:13",Jon S,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Jon-S/3060422-48088,,,60000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The goal is to Gamify your Life with the help of Blockchain Technology via Cardano. It will be similar to Habitica RPG but the app will be more decentralized. There will be a separate lore / world on how the RPG side of this app works (to be provided on a separate Design Document) but the general idea is: 
 
This Cardano App works on real-world goals so ""Tasks"", ""To-Do's"", ""Dailies"", ""Habits"", ""Rewards"" should be user based. All these terminologies / names are not final and is subject to change. Once you setup your goals, tasks, habits, etc..., then you start the process of actually completing them. You will gain ""Experience"" and ""Native currency or ADA"" upon completing certain tasks/goals/to-do's while you will be penalized for missing your dailies/to-dos by things like losing ""Health Points"" and/or ""Experience"", etc.
 
The exciting aspect that I'd like to fully implement within this Cardano Gamify Your Life App is the ability for users to connect with other users, buy items and equipments on a decentralized marketplace, buy and train pets (a.k.a companion/familiar as per RPG term) (and sell them!). There will be options to create / forge your own weapons and transmute them to acquire rare items/equipments which you can also sell on the marketplace. There will be tons of concepts of a Play-To-Earn model to keep users engaged as they continue to maintain their tasks and goals in real-life while having fun and earning ADA. It will have social network integrations to connect their favorite social media channels as they actively uses the app. 
 
The graphic design will be subject for debate if it will use pixel art based style or 2D painted artwork style but I'll leave that to the Graphic Design Team.
 
The idea is to fully implement this on Cardano's Blockchain both on-chain and off-chain. Although if we can't fully do that in order for massively adopting this app for general public use then we need to do a hybrid DApp (we might use resources provided by cloud solution providers). The idea is for this game to have a single codebase but can be played both on Web Browsers of Native App (iOS/Android).
 
A separate Game Design will be part of this deliverable that tackles on the game's mechanics. As for the breakdown of the resources needed to built this idea is as follows:
 
Game Designers 
- This team will just focus on the game's mechanics. Half of it will be based on Task Management Systems like Habitica but more on new lore, battle system etc... It will be a completely new RPG world but still has this great concept of solving real-world problems which will be for the betterment of an individual.
 
Developers 
- This will be a mixture of Cardano Plutus / Haskell developers which will focus on the decentralized aspect of the game such as the in-game wallet, Play-To-Earn model (i.e. if you completed a task with friends then you earn ADA. if just your personal task then you earn just the in-game currency). Another one is like creating your own items for selling, or when you train your familiars/pets/companions then you can trade/sell them to others. These logics lies on the Blockchain for governance. The other mix of this team are the mainstream programming languages/tech stacks in order for us to be sure that we are scalable and able to be adopted by general public as quickly as possible so we need the existing infrastructure / platforms to build with this DApp.
 
Graphic Artists
- This team focuses on building the assets necessary for this Blockchain RPG game. It will be the UX/UI and will affect how this game will be marketed to the general public for adoption.
 
Testers
- This team will focus on just testing the DApp before launch. The concept of beta testing is mostly used on mainstream games but for a Decentralized App which boasts the Cardano Blockchain as its backend then, this part can be taken differently. We can either, do the same beta testing phase (via testnet) then incentivize beta testers on mainnet launch. 
 
The requested funds will be the minimum resources with a MVP product. The idea is to target a full-blown DApp after Alonzo launches to utilize the smart contract functionality of Cardano. The requested funds may vary by a margin. I will be responsible on gathering this team and/or would warmly welcome anyone from our Cardano community who is willing to take part on this idea. If the team is funded and gathered, I can see a 3-5 months development so its likely we can see this DApp by December of this year. 
 
I am willing provide additional information as requested. 
 
Thank you,
Jon

All-in-one Interface to facilitate real estate transactions (buy and sell) using smart contracts on Cardano Blockchain",6,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 13:47",Donny,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Donny/3066733-48088,,,24000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We are Fund 4 winners of a small amount to kick things off. Now applying for Fund 6 to initiate the smart contract development and build a solution we can all use for real estate transactions. 
So far we have established and signed a partnership with a blockchain company to process transactions and issued a ""Manager's Cheque"" in UAE including the commission share agreement and already closed one deal. New partnerships are upcoming. We have also published some content (SEO) and educate investors and worked on link-building mostly. 
 
Product vision:
Make it super easy and accessible for everyone to invest in global real estate assets with cryptocurrencies.
It is not only a buy-and-sell concept, but a full solution where you can invest in already rented out properties and collect running rents, lease out your new apartment for crypto, lend crypto for real estate developers to build new projects (equity investments and mezzanine lending). 
 
Milestones since Fund 4: 
1. Signed a partnership with a Blockchain company registered in Poland and UAE that is assisting with real estate transactions for Dubai real estate market (you need a business establishment with large fiat liquidity to issue so-called ""Manager's Cheque"")
2. Closed one property sale of 354.000 USD and got a small commission in crypto
3. In contact with a Swiss crypto broker to facilitate real estate transactions in the following currencies USD, EUR, CHF (will open more markets and contacts for the product growth)
4. Published a few articles on how to buy real estate with crypto:
4.1. English article - https://estati.ae/blog/buy-real-estate-with-crypto/ 
https://estati.ae/blog/%d0%bd%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b6%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82%d1%8c-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bf%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8e%d1%82%d1%83/
5. Defined initial structure of the smart contract. A few versions are available with property details and without, as well as with arbitraging options. Smart Contract development will be taken care of by ClearContracts.io (https://clearcontracts.io/) and we already discussed the next steps
6. We can already legally process real estate transactions via the Blockchain partner company
7. Established communication with a white-label software company for Tokenization solutions (more for the future project vision)
 
Team:
Donatas Varnas - entrepreneur, product manager, product marketing. +5 years in product design and development primarily within recruitment and gaming industries. +2 years experience with real estate and PropTech solutions
CTO / Tech Infrastructure - ex-CTO of 2 startups, helping out with the infrastructure setup, no blockchain development yet. Does not want to share his name yet.
ClearContracts.io - specializing in smart contract development (financial transactions) on Cardano blockchain including automation and payment releases. 
 
Next steps and the use of new funds:
1. 80% of funds - Initiate a smart contract development (we are starting with a simplified version first, then build up with more property details and confirmations). Salaries for development.
2. 20% of funds - Marketing and backlink building (SEO), need to pay for guest posts and translations. To keep the marketing momentum and get more visibility. 
 
Financing required: 24000 USD
 
P.S. we are realistic. This fund I see a lot of projects asking for +70k USD which is a lot of, especially when the fund should be aiming to get more projects running on Cardano and sponsor multiple entrepreneurs. We are applying for smaller amounts and would rather apply again at Fund7 or Fund8 to keep on building our product and give a chance for other projects to kick-off (instead of asking for a 200k USD). 
 
MVP build:
Our smart contract development partners (ClearContracts.io) already have experience with financing and real estate transactions.
 
1. Stage 1 - MVP will be built to facilitate wallet-to-wallet transactions for real estate, including the deposit validation (normally 5% deposit first, then full amount).
2. Stage 2 - MVP to include arbitraging - in case of payment issues, documents, etc. 
3. Stage 3 (conditional) - smart contract to facilitate all the information about the property, location, address, land plot nr. etc.
Definition of success - have a working smart contract that can transfer funds wallet-to-wallet and contain real estate information. 
Expected launch date - January 1st, 2022. After Fund 6 is closed, we should have enough time to build an MVP and facilitate test transactions.
Metrics:
We are now looking at multiple metrics for product development and growth:
1. Processed transactions (closed real estate deals)
2. Marketing performance - SEO rankings, clicks, inquiries, etc. 
Upcoming tech metrics:
1. Smart contract initiations
2. Successful Smart contract verifications/transactions
3. Number of errors with contract execution
 
Real-life application:
If you are a real estate investor and would like to acquire a property - we can already help with the process. So far we have only closed deals in Dubai, UAE, but other locations are also possible. For individuals and institutional investors, we can also broker apartments, buildings, or land, primarily in the UAE. Yields are 5-7% for regular 12-months contracts, but for holiday homes (short-term rentals) yields are 10-20% (normally around 15%) that can be managed by our local partners here in Dubai and paid out in fiat or crypto. 
 
Market coverage:
1. UAE - with the EU/UAE blockchain company we now cover the United Arab Emirates. We can process transactions here already.
2. Europe and the US - haven't launched yet, but transactions and real estate contracts can be facilitated with EUR and USD currencies. Very thorough KYC/AML must be performed for investors

Team
Coding: Dirk worked for Ubisoft, founded two gaming studios as a Dev Lead, and is currently working as a Technical Architect. He is the go-to guy, well in everything tech-related. Besides running and tracking our stake pool he is doing his magic to create the foundation for our project. 20 years of experience! IF var string = ""you are looking for a coder?"" THEN result=""Dirk"";
Art: Chris is our Illustrator & UX-Designer with more than 15 years of professional work in drawing stuff, gamification, interface- and app design in the industry. Starting as a big fan of the classic Point & Click adventures (Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel Sky, Day of the Tentacle) on DOS and hoarding tons of comic books he turned his geek hobby into an ever-expanding full-time job.
Game Design, Marketing & Sales: Marcin worked in marketing, sales, and project management for THQ, Ubisoft, CI Games, Daedalic Entertainment, and Rockstar. In the past 10 years, he has helped some start-ups in their initial phase. Michael is the second guy and is mainly responsible for game design and balancing. He holds a degree in business administration and had a lot of experience as a QA Tester in the EA environment. Both OG´s love to crunch numbers, always try to find out which RPG class is the best of all times. The struggle is still going on…
Operations & Story: Thomas is the oldest and financial expert within the team. His knowledge about movies, games, and fantasy worlds is immense. He currently tries to tie the stitches to bring the world of ADA to life.
Overall we offer more than 100 years(!cumulated!) of professional gaming and business experience. We all are old-school gamers(started in the mid '80s), played a lot of pen&paper RPGs, love tabletop games, and of course strategy. This project will be something like our legacy. Ada Quest will not only be for the masses, we are developing this title because we like to play our own games. Maybe one day you will meet us on the battlefield or in a dungeon, cave, tavern you name it ;)!
Story
Welcome to the legendary world of ADA.
It is epoch 259! Long before this time, there was a huge war in ADA, which completely cast a spell over the land. It was about the most powerful gemstone, the Goguen Stone! Whoever possessed this stone would be the absolute ruler of this world. Nevertheless, in the greatest battle, the Goguen Stone shattered into four pieces.
After this bloody encounter, a mage, a barbarian, a dwarf, and an elf were each able to take possession of one of these shards. In order not to devastate the land any further, the four heroes agreed to a truce and founded the first four realms.
Now you have arrived on ADA and it is up to YOU to choose your hero and your destiny. Prove your skills and courage in duels and quests to finally conquer this world! But watch out, ´cause nothing is as it seems. An unrecognized greater threat lurks in the darkness, which wants to use this legendary world for its intrigues.
Start your QUEST for ADA now…
! YEAH WE ARE successfully funded in FUND5 !
So what is finished and what we are looking for:

Business Model- Road to success
We like to call our business model a hybrid one. Since we started to develop the world of ADA, we also already invested time and money BUT we also started to create a community around our project, which we like to expanse to an international one.
The initial NFT sale will hopefully allow us to get some financial support from the community, which would flow completely into the development.
The future business model will be a hybrid of in-game sales (only cosmetics, NO pay2win) and community-based funding for upcoming add-ons and maybe some further rewards from running our stake pool successfully.
Besides the initial NFTs sale, what really will help us to get through the phases is the additional ""juice"" to set up the business and run smoothly until the release. The first draft of the game is created by us, our coder, artist, and game designer are working already on Phase I of the project. So the requested funds for a full-blown out mobile game are just fair as far as we can see from our experience. Similar independent projects with the game mechanics we are looking for need around 500K$-1M$ budget minimum. So since we collect already 100K from Catalyst FUND5, we need additional budget to implement PHASE 2 & 3.
Short-Term success after 3-6 months

Awareness of Cardano/ADA getting increased due to our professional game business network
Awareness of Cardano/ADA increased because of our game setting
Our own in-game NFT marketplace monetize (ongoing)
Founding of game studio (done)

Mid-Term success after 6-12 months

Our resources get paid in Ada and we talk about it (further ADA&project awareness/reach increasement)
Alpha version of our game modes (ongoing)
Hiring more resources (ongoing)

Long-Term success after 12-24 months

Full game ready to be released
Project is self-sustaining
Paying back the catalyst funding (further info below)

ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFO: If the game will be a commercial success we would promise to give the requested funds back and support with this initiative as another catalyst project in the future (preferably Africa or charity-related).
We would love to see you support the creation of the world ADA and maybe YOU like to cooperate with us.
This or the other way, let's talk!

Build a platform to create a gamified experience to write and illustrate game-book tales in a collaborative way using the blockchain.",12,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 13:13",Lucio Baglione,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Lucio-Baglione/3062262-48088,,,11600,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


""Tales in the Blocks"" is a collaborative game-book writing tool that allows users to write and illustrate game-book tales using the blockchain to store the content.
Each tale is the product of the content submitted by users, who can add their sentences to the current tale or illustrate the sentences already submitted.
Each tale contains countless other stories: just like in game books, for each sentence already present in a tale, the user can send an alternative, creating a new branch in the tale that other users can decide to continue.
Each alternative sentence can be voted on by users and the most popular ones make up the main tale that is presented upon access to the website.
The user, when sending a sentence, has the ability to generate a unique NFT to collect.
Each sentence can also be voted as the end of the tale: once a particular threshold is reached ( determined by the number of users involved) the tale ends and a limited number of NFTs are generated linked to a PDF that includes all the branches and illustrations collected.
At this point a new tale is initialized.
The website will be a simple viewer of the data saved on the blockchain on the basis of the protocol developed for the Dapp: all the tales will be written, forever, and in an immutable way on the Cardano blockchain!
The project is already extensively developed: the user interface is almost complete and the features illustrated are largely already developed and usable.
It is possible to access two previews:

http://blocktales.dehlic.it/ - the version to test the mechanism and the interface of the Dapp. It is not connected to the blockchain and data is only saved on the development server.
http://testnet.blocktales.dehlic.it/ - the version that relies on the Cardano testnet. The payment and content sending mechanism is not yet implemented, but it is possible to interact with the tale by sending transactions on the blockchain testnet.

User experience
Upon accessing the site, the user can view the current tale, exploring the various branches and various illustrations. A number of actions are available:

Add a new sentence to the current story using the web interface. 
To store the sentence on the blockchain there will be three possible ways:
- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the sentence
- Send a specific amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 3.5 ADA + dust) to save the sentence and obtain the unique NFT of it
- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the sentence.
Create an alternate branch in the tale. 
To store the alternative sentence on the blockchain there will be three possible ways:
- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the sentence
- Send a specific amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 3.5 ADA + dust) to save the sentence and obtain the unique NFT of it
- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the sentence.
Illustrate one of the sentences that make up the tale
Using the interface in the Dapp, the user can create an illustration and store it on the blockchain in two ways
- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the illustration
- Send a specific amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 3.5 ADA + dust) to save the illustration and obtain the unique NFT of it
Vote for a specific branch of the tale. 
To save the vote, the user can:
- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the vote
- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the vote.
Vote for the end of the tale. 
To save the vote, the user can:
- Send a minimum amount of ADA to the dapp wallet (~ 1 ADA + dust) to save the vote
- Send a transaction autonomously with the metadata indicated by the Dapp and save the vote.
Purchase the NFTs of the PDFs of the books-game tales already completed, which will include all the various branches created and all the illustrations.
Their number will be limited and related to the number of users involved in the creation of the specific tale.
It will also be possible to purchase the paper copy of the tale linked to the NFT.

 
Technical Specs
The development consists of three main parts:

Frontend
This is the website used by users to view tales and interact with content.
It is a SPA (Single Page App) developed with the Vue.js framework that consumes data from the Dapp API.
Backend API 
It is the bridge element that connects the blockchain and the frontend. It parses the data from the blockchain (relying on a cardano-graphql node / Dandelion) and serves them in a specific format that can be consumed by the frontend.
It also takes care of recording the content sent by users and sending them to the Dapp engine for storage.
It is developed with the Laravel framework and hosted on a web server.
Dapp engine 
It is the component that takes care of submitting transactions on the blockchain and minting the various NFTs.
It is written in JS using the cardanocli-js wrapper to interact with the cardano node.

The generated NFTs will be stored on IPFS.
 
Marketing and product launch
After the product's public launch a social media marketing campaign will be conducted (mainly on Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, Discord), advertising a ""promotional tale"" that will be created on purpose to highlight the potential of the product.
Each sentence and illustration addition will be published on social media channels and the related NFT generated will be given away to followers.
 
Possible Risks
When we thought about this dApp for the first time, ADA price was not so high, so we ignored that the cost to submit any action to the dApp can be too high for the average user.
In the current design this could be a potential big limitation for the dissemination of the project among users, but unfortunately the minimum ADA per transaction it's something defined in the protocol which cannot be circumvented.
In case we encounter such a problem after development, we plan to research an alternative system, really similar to what is done by Atala Prism now.
Basically, the idea is to create a ""centralized"" sidechain during the tale creation, allowing users to submit sentences and illustrations for free and using a cryptographic mechanism, confirm the integrity of all the content submitted. The Dapp engine will submit content in the blockchain in chunks, maintaining the integrity and verifiability and reducing the cost for the final user.
This solution moves away from the initial idea of ​​using the site only as a ""viewer"" for stories written on the blockchain, but it seems to us an excellent compromise between usability for users and the immutability of the stories.
In case of need this approach will be expanded and a research will be published as a deliverable.
 
Future development (not included in proposal)
In the future we would like to expand the basic concept of the dApp to target specific market segments, for example:

Education: adapt the dApp for kids, creating some special features for teachers to engage young students in creative writing
Comics / Manga: adapt the dApp to support comics collaborative creation

Detailed proposers experience

Dehlic is a software agency born in Italy in 2012 by the initiative of Lucio Baglione.
Through the continuous research and experimentation of new technologies, frameworks and languages, it focuses its attention on the world of web and mobile applications.
Working in close synergy with communication and design studies (such as Macsiotti, Atto, ParcoStudio, The Clocksmiths, Alvvino, Accapiu), it has as a priority objective to grasp even the smallest details of the idea that emerged in the design phase, in order to implement in the most coherent way.
The strong belief that software, instead of placing only technical limitations, should be a tool for achieving the highest level of satisfaction of needs, supports its work every day.

Summary
Monate is a blockchain based API powering ticket distribution project. It therefore puts supply distribution lines to the fore front to enable event organizers to reach consumers efficiently. With the world moving to an online environment and revolutionary tech taking over we believe that with smart contracts and efficient payment systems we will be able to offer a great service to the benefit of all stakeholders. We therefore decided to go with blockchain given its immutable and temper proof characteristics. To reduce any loses and counterfeiting faced by event organizers enabling reach of targeted goals by event organizers. Also ensuring all costs are reduced and reward systems are put in place. The service will therefore ensure event organizers work are put to minimal in terms of distribution of tickets and tags combining also strategic identification techniques to ensure revocation and duplications do not affect distribution lines and hence leading to losses provided there are any cancellations/continued gatherings of the event in future. .
Monate therefore aims to integrate Cardano blockchain into our model in order to disrupt the current practice that people follow to get tickets distributed. We will create an environment where clients needs are empowered through access to opportunities at the same institutional level as exisiting service providers hence reducing effects of intemediaries. This will ultimately create sustainablity in clients operations and increased/improved chance of reaching their targets as intended by use of the service.By reducing costs as far as possible and removing reliance on external parties to deliver a service.
Problem
People are moving towards a norm where information does not want to be given up easily. Making it all about convenience and ensuring a user-friendly interface is being offered. It has further been established that centralized systems can be very costly and present business risks. Breaches of data could cause reputational damage due to need for abiding to privacy regulations. Given the era we are heading into different forms of payment methods are increasing in demand and the need for cost effective ways to transfer value.Event organizers are also losing a lot due to their sales distribution methods due to counterfeiting/duplications.Bus services still are heavily reliant on physical/manual ways to distribute tickets prior to service deliver. Ticketing services are also becoming costly resulting in resorting to manual ways to deliver services. Final consumers are also losing due to inability to track tickets by their identity and request an alternative cheaper way to get reinstated in the event of loss.Cancellation clause are only effective upon selection and incurring a fee which is likely to occur in the event the service is not delivered by the organiser/prior to event due to contingencies. Re-selling of tickets manually also leaves buyers prone to being scammed and incurring higher costs due to unavailability. Intermediaries are increasingly affecting sales channels and affecting the way value can/should be transferred.
Solution
Monate will enable consumers to instil flexibility in their products. Given the nature and use cases of blockchain, technology links can be established between physical products and blockchain unique assigned identity. Giving customers direct access to distribution lines. With blockchain it has further been established that digital solutions can be integrated to empower individuals to control their own identity and verify credentials anytime and anywhere. Through use of various elements of blockchain integrated into our project this will allow a reduction in cost, provide security benefits, convenience, improved transparency and ensure global interaction through strategic alliance with web-based companies and ensure we fulfil a good consumer experience as far as possible.Cancellation and refunding will be made easier in the event of any contingencies. Reinstatement mechanisms will also be put in place.Thus ensuring the ability to store and transfer value easily to stakeholders ultimately. Integration system to facilities(parking lots) & RFIC tags to store funds and make payments / even make adjustments to funds.
Reason for requested funds
The ultimate goal is to make this a peer-to-peer platform ensuring value is created unlike traditional ticket distribution services. For our upcoming quarter the goal is to commence with development of Monate.We requested the amount of funds stated as they will ensure we harness the best out of research of functionality of the API whilst sourcing new members ,contractors & equipment to enable a successive reach of our end goal.

Pyramidal oracles currently built in Ethereum offer a unique solution for executing governance and distribution of power in decentralized, distributed systems. It works on the premise that the shape of power distribution in economies is pyramidal in nature. What's meant by pyramidal is that power flows from the base or bottom of the pyramid to the top of the pyramid.
Those who enter the network first tend to have more power and benefit than those who follow. Those who get in later are at the bottom rungs of the pyramid and as a result have the least amount of power and benefit in the network.
Pyramidal oracles harness this manifestation by distributing ""debt/loss"" tokens to those at less beneficial positions in the pyramid. Distribution of these tokens is based on the length of time the underlying token is held as well as the value depreciation (loss) of said token. This ring of debt / loss can then be used as a security layer to secure blockchain assets.
The debt / loss token can then be staked to oracles and other node implementations to add a layer of protection to the network. To attack the oracle/node you would essentially need to buy back the pyramid against time to accumulate enough ownership in the network to attack it.
The token generated through the ring of debt / loss can be staked with network watchers (Entities tasks with validating information) . These watchers can be used to validate various blockchain inputs and outputs.
Key Objectives:
Explore the viability of bringing the pyramidal oracle structure to Cardano
Model the pyramidal oracle in Cardano
Identify and test use cases for Cardano pyramidal oracles
Solutions
Take a deeper dive into the Ethereum pyramidal structure to test for vulnerabilities
Model the Ethereum pyramidal structure using Plutus smart contracts
Test the pyramidal structure's potential for securing blockchain assets
Consequences
More choice regarding oracles for the Cardano blockchain

A token-based rewards system for contributions for the Shared Reality platform, to support the frictionless flow of information.",1,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 06:00",James Tolley,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/James-Tolley/3097904-48088,,,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Shared Reality platform is here to upgrade our information ecosystem. This proposal will help get the most reliable information into the system as quickly as possible, so that the public can live in a shared reality around such important topics as: Was the 2020 US presidential election stolen? Was there evidence of obstruction and collusion in the Mueller Report? Does Donald Trump suffer from Narcissistic Personality Disorder? Were we all lied into the Iraq War and, if so, was that a crime? Was 9/11 an inside job? Are we currently bring brought through the process of Active Measures and towards Civil War in the United States? Are vaccines and autism related? Etc, etc...
 
Disinformation can only survive because of two defects in our information ecosystem:
 

The public cannot ask questions and get meaningful answers. Because of that, large groups of people can never become satisfied with the prevailing narratives they have been brought to distrust (and which may, after all, be untrue). Right now, the conversation between the media and the people is strictly one-way. Joe Arpaio said, ""You ain't gonna see any damage control"" to counter his false claims about Obama's birth certificate. And, there have not been any. In 2019, 56% of Republicans polled believed that Obama was not born in Hawaii. This is a threat to our republic, and to our lives. In a society where we all know that we're being lied to and we just can't get on the same page about who it is, the existing information infrastructure isn't nearly good enough.

 

When the public wants to know about a topic, it doesn't hear from specialists directly. It hears from pundits and media conglomerates. This is inefficient, costly, and dangerous. Enough with the dynamic of being presented with competing narratives - for decades! The public wants to know what 97% of climate scientists believe. The public should have the ability to raise the funds necessary to find them, vet them, and ask them - in detail - what they believe about each idea around the issue of climate change.

 
That's what the Shared Reality platform is all about. One key step in fulfilling our mission of bringing the best information to the public is: incentivizing specialists to providing that information.
 
This proposal is meant to raise the funds needed to design and create a token on Cardano. Then, that token will be used to reward specialists (and others) for submitting information to the Shared Reality platform. This will build documents of unparalleled neutrality and completeness on any controversial topic.

The testnet wallet at the provider URL has only been tested in Chrome so far.
 
Our twitter: https://twitter.com/MedusaAdaWallet
If you need some testnet ada or tokens, just follow the link: https://developers.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/
 
Medusa AdaWallet - is a free of charge community-driven project of a light wallet combining the best features of other existing offerings.
 
Medusa was the first ITN-compatible public wallet and was released before ITN Daedalus and ITN Yoroi. It worked more consistently and reliably during the ""bloody ITN storms"" that a lot of ITN users (both stake pool operators and delegators) might remember. We listen to our community, so Medusa's UX is more intuitive and simple than others. We are providing smart solutions and automatizations if possible to smooth all ""corners"" of UX for our users.
 
There is an old version at https://adawallet.io, but this version is no longer under active development, with the main focus now being on a new re-designed version, based on cardano-db-sync and Emurgo's serialization lib.
 
The new version has a well-researched and powerful security model. 
Most web developers ignore major security issues for some reason. They:

Store keys and sensitive data in public storage like localstorage or indexed db;
Do keys-processing in the main browser thread;
Even do not encrypt private keys;
Don't care about 3rd party code injections in their code dependencies; 
Don't care about user's browser-extensions which inject their code to the page too;
Asking users to type their mnemonic for each session;

This is an unacceptable approach for finance software. 
Medusa 2.0 does not have these issues, even at MVP stage. A lot of hard work went into achieving this, including researching, engineering, writing our own libraries and mechanics. It's not just yet another cardano-serialization-lib skin.
 
What makes Medusa different?
Security features that are already implemented:

Medusa doesn't store and operate keys within the main browser thread - unmanaged 3rd party code is not able to reach them;
Medusa does not send or store any unhashed / unencrypted data;
Medusa does not perform unnecessary loading of encrypted keys;
Medusa uses it's own network-security layer to transfer your data, so even if your https is compromised, or you use some 3rd party proxy server, or you are connected to untrusted network, your data can't be read by anyone else;
Passwordless ""2FA"" based login system designed in strict accordance with RFC 4226 requirements;
There are no unmanaged code-dependencies;
100% anonymous — we do not collect any user-related data. No email, phone or password needed. 
There are no any analytics scripts.

 
Security features we want to add:

Sessions management;
Ledger integration;
OTP-keys re-generation;
Optional 2FA-based approving for transactions;

 
UX features:
 

User-friendly Daedalus-like UI, but only ""like"", not the same;
It's transaction builder has the best tokens support implementation with special alignment system which solves the floating min/max sum problem when you add tokens to your transaction;
There is a ""send all"" button for any asset with no headache related with ""min ada held by tokens after bunch splitting"";
There are no errors like ""I, machine, can't build this transaction because you, human, didn't count lovelaces properly. Yes, I can solve it, but I won't."" We value your time. If something can be automated - it will be.
Medusa is compatible with desktop browsers as well as their mobile versions.

 
It's an already working product. There is no date of launch -  you can already experiment with a working version of the wallet running on Cardano testnet network..
But..its still in development and testnet-only. 
Medusa has a little team with main developer, artist and testers. It's not a primary occupation for us currently but this could change if we had adequate start-up funding.
We need your support to release the new version of platform and  extend it. 
 
The hardest research part is done, but there are many things we have to add and improve.
Our budget plan is pretty simple:

$24k for the developer salary (2k per month for a year);  

 

Up to $3k for a security audit;  

 

$3k for 3rd party services like translations, art, and, of course, server rental;

 
 
 
 
Medusa Wallet It's a community-driven project. We listen to our users, their requests and suggestions and implement them. The old Medusa has about 1000+ users and we want to bring them a new product as soon as possible. You can accelerate this process. 
 
Thank you!

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This proposal is a continuation of my fund 4 proposal. I am writing this proposal for additional funding to continue development post smart contract deployment. I have already started frontend development and have a working token sale smart contract deployed on the Alonzo purple testnet. I may be one of the first Plutus developers to have an actual functional token swap on Cardano. I gave a talk and walkthrough about the contract at the ADA Maker Space Hackathon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pUvyfrXbwg
 
The current solution for the marketplace will be a locally run react component interacting with decentralized smart contracts and a centralized solution for the market hosted at https://www.logicalmechanism.io This will create a decentralized solution for anyone with the node and cli to interact with the smart contracts as well as create an easy to use website version for beginners.
 
This funding round will secure development funds for the remainder of 2021. I want to release the alpha version of the marketplace with the deployment of smart contracts, providing basic token sale functionality with some additional smart contracts if time permits. As time goes on I will be adding additional smart contracts to the marketplace that will allow advanced token sales like auctioning and royalty payments. It will also host my Fund5 smart contracts when they are released.
 
I am asking for an additional 5000 USD to provide myself with rent, food, and bills for the next couple of months to ensure that I can continue to develop in the Cardano ecosystem.
 
If everything goes to plan, I will have a working market in 3 months with many different smart contract solutions for any type of user. Six months to twelve months I should have the most decentralized solution for token sales. I want this marketplace to be the go-to solution for completely decentralized token sales.
 
Below is an excerpt from my Fund4 proposal:
 
The marketplace is an all-in-one solution for the decentralized trading of user-made tokens. It serves as an easy entry for beginning NFT users, providing a platform for a low-floor-high-ceiling NFT market, and creates a home for advanced users due to the simplicity of design combined with the great flexibility and customization of the marketplace brings to the industry.
A marketplace without gatekeeping.
Any user may register a token with the marketplace and can start trading their token immediately. This opens a new pathway for selling tokenized objects on the internet. In theory, this means art, tickets, houses, cars, anything tokenizable, could be traded in a decentralized way without a controlling party. This is huge and makes this marketplace more than just a simple token swap.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Our goal is to integrate GOTIGER, the most innovative digital signage management platform available, with the Cardano ecosystem. GOTIGER dramatically simplifies and streamlines the process of buying, selling, and managing digital out-of-home media for media owners and advertisers alike.
With our market knowledge and experience in DOOH advertising, GOTIGER combines the power of programmatic advertising with the most advanced interactive experiences, including face and motion detection, AR, live streaming, and QR codes. Advertisers can easily book time slots, publish content, and monitor campaigns independently.
The smart quotation and ability of playback interactive campaigns are the key advantages for most DOOH media owners, due to most of them are non-technical users, want to increase the sales but not having an in-house engineering team.
Measures of success:
This SaaS product will be a game-changer in the DOOH advertising industry. 
Users can easily create dynamic and interactive DOOH moments that capture the audience's attention on digital signs at every crossroad, shopping mall, or public space with high foot traffic internationally.
When combined with the Cardano ecosystem, GOTIGER provides users with a massive range of extra benefits. The network provides full transparency in terms of sales information. There is an immutable record of time, location, and length of campaigns. And, eventually, smart contracts could be used to automate the various stages of an ad campaign.
Timeline:
We will concentrate on integrating GOTIGER infrastructure with Cardano and developing marketing materials in various languages for the first three months.
We will then implement the GOTIGER platform, start from our 3 Times Square clients, a total of 5 billboards and move to global DOOH media partners who own digital signage infrastructure networks in significant cities. Again, we expect this to take around three months. 
For 6 to 12 Months: We will collect the user's feedback to improve the user's experience and enhance the product awareness toward the industry by public keynote speech/ tech forum/ expo or to increase adoption.
Given this timeline, our expected public launch date would be in the second quarter of 2022.

Vision
To be the world's go-to trusted destination for all types of wagering in an all-in-one easy-to-use app. The token holders will act as the house and share in the profits. Along with other types of functions and perks for holding our token and being part of the ecosystem.
How It Works
ALLIN Token - The token that you hold and can use to make bets, by holding this token it represents your share of the profits based on your tokens relative to the outstanding supply. This token comes with the volatility of the crypto markets.
ALLIN Stable Token - This token is pegged to fiat currency such as US Dollar or Euro so that you separate your bankroll from the volatility of the crypto markets but do not receive a portion of profits for holding this token.
Bet Types
Bet vs. Chain - You can place a bet similar to a sportsbook but instead of betting the house you are betting against the blockchain. Everyone that owns tokens in the ecosystem acts as the house.
When someone wins a bet, the system will mint that amount of tokens to payout the bet and the reverse if someone loses a bet, the system will burn that amount of tokens that was bet.
Every bet and Mint/Burn transaction is recorded on the blockchain to make sure there's no foul play.
By holding the token there will be fluctuation in terms of minting and burning of the tokens due to the bets but also of the supply and demand of the price of the token.
This is how we're able to turn the ecosystem of token holders into ""the House"" and have a sustainable ecosystem that brings change to an industry that is ready for it.
Person-to-Person - You can place a bet controlling the subject, odds and terms through blockchain smart contracts and have another person accept that bet with no middleman.
Pools - You can start a pool with friends/co-workers or join a pool with people from around the world in a variety of pool types across all sports and other subjects that use smart contracts to validate results. Some examples are survivor pools, bracket pools, Pick'em tournaments, celebrity pools, etc.
Esports/Video Games - You can bet on professional esports teams or you can play someone in your favorite video game, card game or other games.
Sports Index Tokens - It's the stock market for the sports world. Replace companies with players or teams. Trade team/player performance tokens that create an algorithmic score or rating based on many different factors (stats, salary, media/popularity, etc.) that is unique to a specific sport. These performance ratings generate dividends for token holders. It's a free and open market to trade these tokens where the price will be based on supply and demand.
Casino Games - You can play online casino and card games with trust and transparency that the outcomes are fair through the use of blockchain technology.
Fantasy Sports - You can start a league with friends/co-workers or join a league with people from around the world in a variety of fantasy types across a variety of sports. Some examples are daily fantasy, season-long leagues, keeper leagues, playoff leagues, etc.

Mirqur combines portfolio and range pool variants to increase profitability/flexibility of liquidity provision.",140,"Tuesday, 24 August 2021 09:05",Benjamin Chatwin,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Benjamin-Chatwin/3099172-48088,,,36200,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Mirqur has unified and improved upon a number of interesting features which until now were only available mutually exclusive. We have focused on ensuring our mathematical solutions and system architecture is optimal. In doing so, we aim to deliver a solution that simplifies and increases profitability of liquidity provision and trading.
It is important that our users can understand and leverage these features in ways that are most applicable to their current investment strategy(s). It's important to mention some of the key features that we are building in order to understand the value of our project proposal. As such, below is a list of our features and a more comprehensive overview of our DEX can be found in our light paper here - https://mirqur.io/mirqur.io_lightpaper.pdf
DEX Features
Portfolio-pools - Portfolio pools allow liquidity providers (LPs) to easily add a number of tokens to a pool and adjust their ideal ratios arbitrarily. This simplifies portfolio management.
Range-pools - Range-pools give individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated. This increases the profitability of liquidity provision.
Impermanent loss insurance - If you qualify and withdraw while in impermanent loss, you will be reimbursed for the difference. This secures your crypto assets. Note - this is a feature that needs to be brought on following the release of the platform due to the nature of the insurance mechanism.
Roadmap
Q3 2021 - Fundraising, testnet, smart-contract implementation
Q4 2021 - Mainnet launch, audit, data collection for trade optimiser, portfolio-range pools
Q1 2022 - Impermanent loss and AI trade optimisers
Team
Our team has worked for big tech companies such as Amazon and Microsoft as well as startups in Sweden and Seattle. This combination of experiences gives us both the rigour but also the ""getting-things-done"" mentality. Our team has a combined Haskell experience of over 10 years of Haskell which is perhaps one of the key factors to success in Cardano atm. You can find more information on our team on our website - https://mirqur.io/#team
Definition of Activities
Activities for this project proposal are centered around the user experience of the DEX both from the perspective of the LP and the traders.
Given that we have expanded the feature set available to LPs, the interface for liquidity provision needs to be logical and follow a familiar flow to what LPs may be used to. It should cater to all investors who have varying degrees of experience with these concepts.
Being able to get a sense of the market and different portfolios is key for decision making. By improving the way we display key market indicators such as trading volume, total locked value and price fluctuation, we will ensure that our users make responsible and profitable investment decisions. In the future, this feature will be expanded when we release some of our LP provision optimisation tools whereby the use of different liquidity provision strategies will be reflected in the dashboard.
This project proposal is focused on two main activities:
Improving the interface for providing liquidity to portfolio-range pools to ensure that liquidity providers can take full advantage of our feature set through a familiar and logical UI.
Implement a dashboard for monitoring different portfolio pools and highlighting popular pools. This will enable users of our platform to make better decisions about how they provide liquidity and trade using our platform.
Definition of Success
This project can be broken down into two deliverables which will all be delivered within 3 months:
(1) An improved interface for providing liquidity provision which also includes:
     - A minimum of 10 user-testing sessions
     - DEX UX/UI report
(2) A Portfolio tracking and monitoring dashboard
Budget
The total budget for the two listed deliverables and costs including VAT:
 
40 research hours - UI/UX user testing and reporting
100 engineering hours - An improved interface for providing liquidity provision.
60 engineering hours - Portfolio tracking and monitoring
 
Fixed cost for this work which is composed of developer's salary, accounting/taxes and VAT: $36,200

Win-Win is a decentralized dispute resolution platform and marketplace built on the Cardano blockchain. It allows disputing parties to find a suitable mediator to help resolve their conflict in a timely and cost-effective manner outside the court system. The marketplace enables mediators to focus on the mediation process without having to engage in often questionable business boosting practices; cases flow to mediators for a small percentage of their mediation fee.
 
A Primer on Mediation
Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that allows disputing parties to come up with their resolution that ideally satisfies the interests of all parties.
On page 266, Carrie J Menkel-Meadow, Lela Porter-Love, Andrea Kupfer-Schneider, and Michael Moffitt write in Dispute resolution: Beyond the adversarial model (published by Aspen Publishers in 2005):
""[It is] a process in which an impartial third party acts as a catalyst to help others constructively address and perhaps resolve a dispute, plan a transaction, or define the contours of a relationship""
A mediator, usually a neutral third party with no prior connection to any of the parties, controls the process of the mediation, but not the outcome. Ultimately, mediation allows for parties to collaboratively solve their dispute.
This is in stark contrast to litigation, where parties are becoming increasingly entrenched throughout the process as adversaries.
Mediation within communities and the workplace have become common. Depending on the type of case and jurisdiction, parties may be required to seek mediation prior to being permitted into the court room. As mediation has an extremely high success rate in the upper ninety percent range, many cases never make it into litigation.
As the term mediator is not protected, anyone can claim to be a mediator. However, a skilled mediator has commonly gone through an extensive training program. Certified mediators on Win-Win have advanced degrees in Conflict Resolution or Law in addition to having graduated from effective mediation training programs.
Some mediations may also require special subject matter expertise, as discussed on Ken Adam's livestream: 
Most importantly, mediators are great listeners. Parties will be heard --- something that the court system cannot guarantee.
 
Problems of the current mediation system vs Solutions through Win-Win
#1 Problem: Trusting Credentials
Parties cannot easily verify mediators' credentials, and the number of innacurate or even false credentials in the field is increasing constantly in the last years.
Solution: Trust
Universities and peacebuilding organizations verify their graduates on Cardano. Parties have access to professional mediators and can check their certifications.
 
#2 Problem: Mediation process slow to start
Conflicting parties do not have months to start the mediation process when they are ready to kill each other, and the current process to set up a mediation might take that long.
Solution: Convenience
Parties find mediators specialized for their case instantaneously through our DApp. Clients flow to qualified mediators, according to their availability.
 
#3 Problem: No refund/payment guarantees
Mediators may favor the party who pays their fees first. Mediators sometimes have to run after their money. Parties have no refund guarantees on a no-show by the mediator.
Solution: Smart contracts
Refunds and payments are handled by smart contracts. The mediator doesn't know who paid first, therefore lower risk of bias in the mediation process. The parties are refunded in case of a no-show by the mediator.
 
#4 Ethical mediators don't have repeat clients
As the DevOps of Conflict Resolution, mediation helps parties to solve not only their acute, but also future disputes.
Good for the world, but bad for business.
Mediators focus on the process
Win-Win pre-selects suitable mediators for any given case. On Win-Win, mediators can focus on doing their work, and not trying to be the loudest on social media.

As there is overlap between coming up with solutions to the challenges of this proposal and creating educational content as part of the PPBL Team, this proposal is in part funded by Gimbalabs. This reduces some of the labor costs and is reflected in the funds requested.
Furthermore, Win-Win is part of CardStarter's Hack Cardano! hackathon and has a shot of winning prize money and development support. In the event that Win-Win receives such an award, the funds here requested will be used to accelerate development and integration of features that are planned for a later date.
 
Total $25000 broken down:

Labor (team member compensation): $20816
Tech services (hosting, GCP, GSuite etc.) 1 year: $2184
Incorporation and legal fees: $2000

 
Project sustainability
Once developed, Win-Win will generate income by charging a small, one-digit percent fee on every mediation process that happens through the platform. By then, the project will no longer need funding through Catalyst or other means, and it will be sustainable for the long term.
 
UX/UI Designers/Developers wanted

How can users of smart contracts avoid disputes that give rise to lawsuits? The goal is to create the legal resources developers of smart contract dApps need to offer binding arbitration clauses in both P2P and enterprise level transactions. It is commonly said that code is law when it comes to smart contracts. This is misleading. Most contracts, whether written in natural language or as self-executing code, can give rise to disputes that lead to costly lawsuits.
Solution: The best route to avoid the time, expense and uncertainty associated with lawsuits over smart contracts is writing effective dispute resolution and binding arbitration clauses. We propose to (1) develop educational resources for the Cardano community about the dispute resolution and arbitration process, and (2) create a set of readily available legal templates for binding arbitration clauses that developers can incorporate into their dApps to support users making smart agreements.
Team and Experience:

Lead: JEFFREY DOWNARD, university professor specializing in law, ethics and logic. PI of collaborative projects to build educational resources, director of crowdsourcing project.
DAVID WATTS, business systems oriented on the problems of blockchain scalability.
SARAH HOLCOMB, practicing attorney in business transactions, trusts, estates, taxes, university lecturer in business law
TOM DIETRICH, practicing attorney in business transactions, contracts, dispute resolution, arbitration, IP.
Board of Advisors: https://www.keplerscs.com/our-team-1

IP:
Open workshop on Zoom in both a live and recorded form. The educational resources will be publicly available via a Youtube channel under copy left permission. The templates will be freely available for developers and dApp users in the Cardano community.
Defining success:
A series of workshops with participants drawn from the legal and developer communities. Integrated video tutorials on the use of provisions for choice of law and jurisdiction and binding arbitration clauses in smart contracts. A set of templates for smart agreements written in both natural language and Plutus.
Timeline and Budget:
Phase 1: 

Months 1-3:  Legal Research on choice of law and jurisdiction, dispute resolution and settlement procedures and binding arbitration clauses in smart contracts: ($5,000)
Months 1-2:  Workshop budget: Coordinator, assistant ($2000)
Months 1-2:  Website development and and Youtube channel: ($2000)
Months 2-4:  Creation and editing of an integrated set of video tutorials on the proper use of provisions for choice of law and jurisdiction and binding arbitration clauses in smart contracts.  ($2000)
Months 2-4:  Development of templates for smart agreements written in both natural language and a design for a dApp to process the clauses in Plutus and Marlowe: ($10,000)
Months 2-4:  Development of framework for dApp/integration for processing binding arbitration clauses. ($18,000)
Months 1-4:  Project direction: three months ($9,000)
Months 1-4:  Project oversight and evaluation by members of Board of Advisors, 3 months ($7,000)
Budget Total Phase 1:  $55,000
Months 5-9: transition to Phase 2 of the project to test and implement the binding arbitration dapp

Our team is committed to the effective use of Catalyst funds to achieve the goals of the project and support the larger Cardano community. Towards this end, we are committed to procedural safeguards in the form of oversight by a board of advisors with a wide range of areas of expertise in finance, accounting, startups and IP. The board will provide oversight and auditing functions as a guarantee.

The customer has to take the word of the VPN provider that they are not collecting their and logging their online data. The VPN host also has access to the customer's location data and hardware device information. The customer also has to trust the VPN provider that they will not fall victim to a cyber-attack and data breaches. Recently, this has been a growing concern due an increase in targeted exploits involving ransomware. Because even if the companies did not log customer online data, they would still have a record of the customers payment information and personal identity. To go along with that point, the customer also has to trust that the VPN provider will not commit fraud, since they are in direct possession of the customers payment information.
 
Traditional VPN companies have servers located in select cities around the globe. This provides some decentralization, however, everything is usually controlled through a headquarters. The headquarters can be subject to national and international laws and can be prone to government interventions and seizures. If the VPN company has a choice between releasing information about a single client to the government or having their operations shut down, the businessmen will always choose option that allows them to continue business as usual. Additionally, the customer has to trust that the VPN provider will remain politically neutral and will not restrict the browsing capabilities of the customer.
 
The competition for a fully featured dVPN has increased dramatically in a short amount of time. The Ethereum blockchain already has the major leader with Orchid and a promising up-and-comer in Mysterium. Sentinel has been developing with Cosmos. The market has proven that there is a demand for dVPN services. With the introduction of Cardano's Smart Contracts, the blockchain is in a prime position to throw its hat in the ring. In order for Dolos to separate itself from the competition, several key features will need to be developed so that the experience will be truly unique in this ecosystem.
 
## Key Features that will be Developed
### Network Slicing
Slice the traffic into different chunks as it gets passed through the internet.
### Relays & Multi-hops
Instead of having a single point between browser and the internet, the traffic bounced across a few different nodes before exiting.
### Split Tunneling
Direct a portion of the traffic through the dVPN, while routing the rest through the standard open internet. This can reduce unnecessary strain on the dVPN.
### Kill Switch
In the event of connection interruption between the dVPN service, the kill Switch will block all network traffic. Thus, preventing inadvertently compromising the users privacy.
### Stealth VPN Protocols
Bypass strict DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) firewalls by wrapping and obfuscating the header in SSL/TLS encryption and reroute traffic through a typical HTTPs port. Through obfuscation, it becomes nearly impossible for nations with strict censorship to block or throttle a users internet traffic.
### Traffic Whitelist for Node Operators
Node operators have the choice to only allow internet traffic for websites they specify. This reduces the risk of ISP companies terminating the node operators internet access, due to accessing content that is illegal locally.

There is plenty room for an idea like this to prosper. The average payout is currently less than a penny per stream, making it almost impossible for independent artists to survive on their passion. Instead of a system where every click or rewind is calculated behind a curtain by some unknown entity, it should be open and ran by the public. This system will allow us to offset any monthly or yearly cost on the listeners end, as well as pay the artist directly in a native token, where they can decide to either keep that token or trade it for their preferred currency. This will all happen almost seamlessly on the blockchain. While holding and staking the native token, listeners will help keep the network secure and given rights to vote on certain issues such as changes to royalty rates.

Current US pipeline control security is antiquated and in need of upgrading.
The recent Colonial pipeline ransom-ware attack (May 9th 2021) by ""The DarkSide"", highlighted the fact that the current control/security system is vulnerable to attack. Colonial voluntarily shut down its pipeline as a precautionary measure. 
Colonial's ""single"" pipeline shut down was significant enough to prompt a state of emergency declaration by the President of the United States, and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, and directly affected 6 states crippling the gasoline and jet fuel supply. 
Perspective: Colonial constitutes only a small part of the greater pipeline infrastructure in the US. According to Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) there are currently 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipeline in the United States. The control system ""SCADA"" is known to have vulnerabilities.
I propose to perform a feasibility study that would explore how Cardano's blockchain tools might be implemented into the industries existing control system. The study would reveal how an immutable consensus mechanism could be built into the system to validate both input and output. 
Each station transmitter could be given a unique ID verifiable by the blockchain. By using verifiable ID's from system transmitters, technicians can act with certainty, rather than possibly acting on counterfeit data. 
I will also examine how smart contracts could be used in the greater pipeline system verifying system commands using oracles and other tools only allowing access if certain equipment after pre-arranged criteria is met. I see this out on the horizon a bit, but it could end up being a totally new way of controlling stations and should be looked at seriously.
I am a long-term QA inspector in the US oil and gas industry, and have worked for the ""major"" oil and gas companies and have a unique perspective to little known industry standards and practices.
Currently I am Chief inspector overseeing the construction of a 150-million-dollar natural gas turbine compressor station upgrade that provides NG to two nearby Northeastern cities whose combined population is 500,000. Later this year I will be overseeing the installation of the SCADA control system that will remotely control this station. During this phase of my project, I will have face to face access to industry experts that can give me needed input on how blockchain might be integrated into pipeline control, and data acquisition and processing.

Cardano needs multiple use cases in the media and entertainment industry.  Smart contracts offer the ability to digitize the whole production process.  Historically, production companies are special purpose vehicles that favor producers and investors.  We feel strongly that smart contracts and cryptocurrencies can help kindle a new way of making television, movies and media by creating a more equitable process for creators and investors alike.
 
What this is?
Project Babbage is a start-small idea that could grow into something big, but is meant to be an experiment first.  Can the Cardano ecosystem's upcoming Alonzo hard fork (and smart contracts) support the pre-production, production and post-production activities of a production company -- including things like voting for greenlight analysis, paying writers and actors for validatable work, investments, profit percentage points, etc.  
By start-small, we mean that we are asking for funding to experiment with a few ideas:
#1 - Building a story that showcases blockchain and Cardano:  this phase will pay a few writers to create a story that showcases cryptocurrency's potential to change the world.  The writers will produce three story outlines, which will be published during our periodic updates.    
#2 - Pay for the pre-production story phase using a simple smart contract.  In other words, we'll build the smart contract MVP to create the initial story agreement, confirm receipt of story (exchange between producer and writers) and pay writers in their own wallets.  
ALL OF THIS ON A BLOCKCHAIN WITHOUT THE EXCHANGE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION ON A CENTRALIZED DATABASE.
What this isn't?
We are not trying to solve media and entertainment production world peace.  Other projects on, for example, Ethereum -- like Mogul STARS, for example -- seem to focus on the glitz and glamor of investment, glamorizing a Kickstarter-on-steroids-like concept.  Such projects start with the glitz of funding a movie, but do not seem to offer the most important element:  proving how the architecture of a blockchain will make the lives of creators and investors better.
Our belief is that no one really knows, and therefore building hype and ICOs before experimenting with concepts first is nothing more than vaperware.  
Please don't misunderstand:  we have big ideas.  We foresee a world where every component of media production -- especially film and television -- can be executed via blockchain.  
But that world, in our opinions, should start small.  And fail fast.  
 
So then how will this funding be used exactly?
The funding will be used to create three minimum viable concepts.

Building the smart contract / dapp MVP to pay the writers ($30K)
Paying writers for three ideas ($10K)
Community Engagement ($5K) 

 
Roadmap:
Q4 2021 -- Build a Minimum Viable Concept with story ideas 
Q1 2022 -- Build Pre-Production Smart Contracts; Film Financing Workflow Phase 1
Q2 2022 -- Film Financing Workflow Phase 2

Smart contract for individuals to raise ADA based on a ""career plan""; Investors receive $time tokens to vote, distribute funds, or redeem.",9,"Monday, 23 August 2021 09:05",Tom Wells,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Tom-Wells/3097987-48088,,,14041,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The ultimate end-game of decentralisation is the Empowered Individual over The Organisation.
Decentralised investing in high-potential individuals
Not a traditional ""microlending"" model, but rather a decentralised ""investment"" model - where talented individuals can raise funds to further their own careers through training and tech equipment (laptop, etc). ""Time-tokens"" are issued by each individual fund raising smart contract, allowing for voting & distribution of funds to individuals as needed.
This project contributes to solving the adoption of ADA by becoming the primary ""bank account"" for highly skilled individuals such as software engineers, lawyers & doctors to fund their career investment, receive mentoring and support, and eventually deliver high demand services to employers.
Mechanism
Future ""Rockstars"" can pitch for funding, based on a proposal of training, equipment, career path. Investors commit to providing funding. If the proposal targets are reached, ADA are held in a ""treasury"" and $time tokens are released to investors proportionately (each representing 1 hour of actual work by the Rockstar) with some kept back as rewards / incentives for the Rockstar to reach certain milestones. ADA is never distributed to the Rockstar directly, but rather through a ""partner / supplier"" ecosystem to ensure it is used correctly, and these payment events are voted upon by Investors (based on their $time token holdings). Investors are able to trade tokens, but also ""cancel"" them - receiving back a proportion of the ADA remaining in the proposal treasury - meaning that $time tokens will always have a ""minimum"" value - ie the proportionate value of the ADA in the treasury at any point in time. Of course, the idea is that the value of the $time token is also linked to the value of that 1 hour redeemable for actual work performed by the Rockstar - e.g. Lawyer, Doctor, Data Scientist, Cloud Engineer - and therefore becomes an effective means of accessing / investing in this class of skill.
Keep in mind that $time token are specific to each individual - ie they would have a separate minting policyIds backing them - per proposal (in Plutus speak) - which is such a perfect fit!
Partner / Supplier Ecosystem
There is huge potential for bridges to be built to other decentralised businesses, such as a few that are already being contemplated for Fund 6. For example, funds raised in a Rockstar contract could easily be disbursed into a Tutorchain contract via a bridge, allowing for training to be provided with a reputable tutor or mentor. Other partners could provide contracts for certifications (e.g. Plutus Pioneers, AWS, or PluralSight), and others could provide raw resources, such as access to cloud computing infrastructure for machine learning training. 
Partners & Suppliers would have to be managed and vetted via a decentralised mechanism, and this is where it becomes a little more complex as to exactly how this happens - and therefore the initial idea is to maintain a list of pre-vetted partners, and slowly allow the model to evolve (such as how Cardano block producing was initially bootstraped in a centralised way). Probably something like Atala PRISM would help here, providing some sense of identity for both Rockstars and partners.
$time token trading
Investors could have many reasons for buying $time tokens, but probably there are two main reasons. 
Firstly, they might genuinely foresee a demand for a particular skill at a future date - for example a Bank might be embarking on a multi-year cloud transformation project, which they predict will require a large amount of cloud engineering skills. They could therefore choose to invest in a number of Rockstars who have cloud engineering on their career path, buying up that time at a reduced price, and then holding those $time tokens until they have matured and redeeming them for delivery on their cloud projects. This would be an alternative to a traditional ""intern"" model, or graduate recruitment programme. 
The second type of investor could be more of a pure speculator - someone who has identified a trend, and wants to invest early in the trend. For example ""how do i go long on cloud computing?"". With Project Rockstar, you simply buy up $time tokens that fit your predicted skill, and then take part in mentoring and growing those individuals along a path towards increasing the value in the individual. At some point into the future you can then sell those tokens to whoever requires them at that point in time, or convert them fluidly into the next big demand skill, and continue the cycle. Everyone wins.   
Development Phases
Development will be split into 2 major phases, with the intention to build some momentum from a simple, but fully functional MVP in phase 1.
Phase 1 - MVP of basics
This will be developed through the funding provided by Fund 6. Still to be fleshed out in more details, but high-level components include:

Simple ""parameterised"" proposals (Plutus/Marlowe smart-contracts)
Simple portal to Pitch, Invest and Launch (fund raising portal)
Simple DAO functionality (principle proposes, investors vote, disburse, cancel and redeem tokens)
Fixed, vetted, 3rd party providers (training, certification, equipment, etc - maybe start with centralised vetting)

Phase 2 - High value next steps
The next iteration under consideration, highly flexible and based on demand

Open 3rd party providers (based on some sort of decentralised vetting process)
DEX for trading of time tokens
Remote video conferencing facility, allowing for direct redemption of time tokens 1-on-1 between principle individual and token holder, potentially including a scheduling, project management and team management (i.e. allowing for more than 1 individual redeeming time in parallel for a single investor)

FAQ Zone
Clarifications based on some great questions and discussions with the community
How is this not digital slavery (ie selling an obligation for future work)?
$time tokens can be considered ""obligations to work"" - but of course this model would not work as the Rockstar could simply run away and make themselves unavailable. The model is not yet fully described in the proposal, but the idea is that Rockstars would ""earn"" $time tokens back as they ""work"" with a token holder. Keeping in mind that $time tokens are ""cancellable"" against the treasury, they actually represent real world tangible value (as opposed to ""hype"" value in the example of humanipo). For example, if the Rockstar works 10 hours, she earns 10 $time tokens, which can be cancelled at her treasury for 20 ADA each (and obviously the ratio of $time to ADA is dependent on the launch parameters of her contract). Of course the Rockstar could also re-sell those earned $time tokens back to the market at a higher value, should the ""hype"" mean there is a higher demand for that particular skill.
The idea of capturing real value (via ADA) into the contract is key to this - there is no need to generate hype - you can simply look at the value of the treasury and divide it by the number of $time tokens in circulation - and thats the minimum value of that $time token (taking into account funds provisioned for spending against the career path - but i'm trying to keep it simple). As the value of the skill in the market increases, the value of the ""hour"" of time would increase, more trading/earning would occur, and therefore more value would be captured in the treasury in a feedback loop, lifting the minimum value of the $time token. Eventually the Rockstar could even earn back all of their $time tokens, and decide to exit by cancelling the full set, redeeming all the value in the treasury - this would be analogous to ""retiring"" in the real world. 
It should now be clear that this model is very inspired by Cardano's own treasury model, including the Catalyst mechanism!
Another important factor is to limit the total supply of $time token - my initial thinking is approx 1,000 per Rockstar contract. This is close to 6 months of full-time work for an individual - which feels like a manageable time horizon. Of course this needs testing, and it's possible that a much smaller value would work better to try to find a good balance between total value of treasury vs incentive to hold/earn tokens. Testing would take place with the first cohort of ""pilot"" Rockstars.

Nature Coin's mission is to create an international community backed by sufficient financial capital to eliminate climate change. We'll provide substantial value to the Cardano community by bringing new users into the ecosystem who are foreign to crypto, but passionate about the environment.
Nature Coin acts as a governance token for an environmental DAO. The community will control a treasury that's used to invest in environmental projects, for example a climate tech startup or a solar energy farm. The treasury for the Nature Coin community will be funded via several means:


Inflation. Similar to how Project Catalyst is funded in Cardano, Nature Coin will have a 1% annual influx of new tokens that goes directly to the treasury for the community to control. 


Ecosystem services. Nature Coin will have several utilities, such an NFT marketplace which requires Nature Coin to buy/sell art, or a video game which requires Nature Coin to play the game. This will create inherent demand for the token, causing the price to rise and thus providing the community with additional purchasing power. We would also charge a small fee to users interacting with these services, providing further funding for the treasury. 


Return on investments. In return for funding projects, the community will receive either equity or cashflow in projects that are for-profit. For example, let's say the Nature Coin community pays a renewable energy company $1,000,000 to build a solar farm that generates profits of $200,000 per year. Each year those profits would be used to purchase Nature Coin tokens and send them to the Hive's treasury. This would enable the community to re-invest in new projects. Another example could be the community deciding to invest in an early-stage climate tech startup in return for equity. If that startup goes on to IPO for billions of dollars, all of that capital would be returned to the treasury whenever the Nature Coin treasury decides to sell their shares. You can imagine how much funding this would provide to the DAO.

Develop a simple payment gateway solution for businesses to be able to accept Cardano Ada as a payment method.  The two immediate use cases are for both the Cannabis industries, as well as the Knife Making Industry.  Both businesses traditionally are relegated to cash only payments, because of the threat of banks seizing funds, and credit card processors denying to do business with them.  Now that the exchanging of Crypto Currency to Fiat (and vice versa) is considered to be low risk and acceptable with banks, these businesses can benefit from being able to accept payment in Crytpo, and mitigates complications with storage of funds if exchange for fiat.
 
Today there is already simple applications made for peer to peer payments using traditional fiat.  These include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, and Zelle.  No simple application yet exists for peer to peer crypto currency exchange.
This proposal would be for the development of an application that can integrate with modern biometric features of smart phones for security, storage of cardano (wallet), and simple payment interaction between parties.
 
Because of anticipated difficulties in being accepted by Apple for use as an iPhone/iPad application, this first phase would focus on an Android application.  Apple based applications would be created at a point in the future.
For the application to be adopted, it will require an extensive ux/ui with extensive security testing.  A typical application would cost roughly $50k-$100k to develop.  We are requesting minimal seed funding to begin this development.  Funding would be used for phase 1 to create the initial user interface demo app.  Initial application development would likely have minimal functionality.  Future phases to bring the application to market would require further investments.  Capitol for future phases would be raised via future Catalyst Funds, and community investment in the project.

I am building a platform that businesses can use to add on the ability to transact on Cardano.  This will create another revenue stream, as it caters to a niche group of loyal enthusiasts.  I have another catalyst proposal running concurrently for creating a full loyalty and incentive program that business can use.  This catalyst proposal focuses on the tax implications for a business that transacts on Cardano.  We would develop a platform that can track inbound and outbound payments for a designated wallet(s).  We would monitor real time ADA pricing to track the fiat value of each transaction.  Using the businesses historical tax burden, we would separate a portion of inbound revenue in to a wallet for tax purposes.
 
A stretch goal would be to work with relevant taxing authorities to accept tax payments in Cardano Ada.  If they were to allow this, we would associate the ada collected to business.  This would eliminate having to send in a large payment at the end of the year, and would also eliminate the burden of having to exchange your crypto currency for fiat.
 
The requested funds would be used to receive consultation from crypto tax experts, server hardware, and software development.  The financial breakdown is as follows:
 
$25,000 for initial minimal hardware, and testnet development.

.
Why do we need to enhance data sharing of subsea inspection images and videos?
Most of the companies and entrepreneurs working in the subsea Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) field have been struggling with proper access to subsea images and videos for years and years. Still today, there is no database compiling this data at a worldwide basis and a huge part of interesting subsea images and videos remains unused, stored in hard disks inside forgotten dusty warehouses, with no further use possible.
Based on recent industry trends of robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, autonomous vehicles, internet of things, etc., many companies, research centers, universities, and entrepreneurs have been developing innovative data-processing tools to enhance their product developments. These players have been looking forward to better understanding how to combine different technologies (i.e., computer vision, machine leaning, blockchain, etc.) with their underwater robots working in the Oil & Gas and Offshore Wind Energy markets, where the need to reduce operating expenditures continues to challenge owners and operators to improve efficiencies and enhance safety in maritime operations.
Many of the players mentioned above are currently developing their own AI-based image recognition tools to enable deeper insight on offshore assets integrity condition. For that purpose, they intend to use their Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) to effectively collect, process, and perform advanced data analytics, enabling data-driven decision-making tasks on site. For instance, the automatic detection of key features and/or anomalies could use Machine Learning / Deep Learning algorithms trained by relevant data in thousands of hours of survey videos, which unfortunately are not available yet at a global basis. Traditional offshore Oil & Gas assets' structures are somehow standardized (particularly in offshore wind farms where all turbines have the same structure), presenting enough regularity to allow patterns to be learned by the ML algorithms.
Fortune Business Insights has estimated that the subsea Inspection, Maintenance and Repair (IMR) market size was USD 7.19 billion in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 17.33 billion by 2026, with decommissioning, revitalization works, and increasing focus on unmanned vehicles being the major drives for market growth ( https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/offshore-inspection-repair-maintenance-market-100405 ). Based on the afore-mentioned gap identified in this subsea market, we are proposing herein a Blockchain distributed ledger which has the potential to become the new solution for a worldwide decentralized subsea data network of underwater inspection players mutually contributing to one another.
 
Why using blockchain?
Most of the classic authentication methods and centralized security mechanisms used in shared databases require a trusted third-party, whose systems sometimes lack security in design, are not able to defend against cyberattacks, face resource constraints, etc. Besides that, ensuring that data transmitted across networks are kept secure and private without high computational cost remains a challenge. The current settlement and reconciliation processes involved in these data transactions could be solved using Blockchain technology, which will impact the cost of verification of these transactions in the distributed ledger proposed herein.
Blockchain will facilitate decentralized storage for recording underwater inspection data and secure processing and sharing of this data among different entities. Blockchain technology is the ideal solution for this application which require decentralized access control, storage, and distributed trust. Blockchain will provide support in terms of data security and integrity. The secure routing of underwater inspection imaging data through the hierarchical topology of the Blockchain platform will ensure the legitimacy of all data sources to all platform participants, allowing them to use this data at their own interest and benefits, as previously explained.
 
SuBChain, a Distributed Subsea Data Ledger
SuBChain aims at becoming the standard Blockchain solution for a leveraged distributed, decentralized peer-to-peer network to enable subsea inspection data to be shared and stored securely and inexpensively without relying on any intermediary authorities, while still ensuring data privacy.
The participants of this Blockchain platform will be processing and validating underwater inspection data prior to confirming the inclusion of this data to the system via consensus mechanism, eliminating the need of intermediaries' involvement to process this data, preventing fraudulent activities, and ensuring data immutability, transparency, and operational resilience of the ledger by leveraging public key infrastructure to authenticate, authorize entities, and encrypt subsea data records.
Tokenization will help bootstrap the network by providing platform users with the incentives to contribute their resources to build and sustain it. The role of the Tokens will be played in incentivizing the growth, operations, and security of the platform, by helping it expand its user base and honestly reward underwater inspection professionals who contribute to the ledger with their digital assets.
Some activities that could be encouraged via Tokens are constructive feedback on the inspection videos (with some monitoring to avoid ""robot"" users generating automatic activities to get those rewards), referrals of the platform to other professionals, etc. For example, writing positive reviews about the platform and freely marketing it to others will help attract more users and boost the platform's relevance.
The Tokenization should adopt a smart user-rewarding strategy. For example, independent professionals and operators can upload their data to the platform and get token-rewarded based on the number of times their videos are used by other users. Tokens can be assigned to the users each time their video is used or downloaded and then they can later redeem their tokens for money, thereby building a reputation system within the platform.

In the United States, a certificate of deposit (CD) is one of the most secure financial assets – insured by either the NCUA or the FDIC each up to 250,000 USD. A CD constitutes a document that signifies the right to withdraw funds that were deposited into an account after a specified period of time plus interest. In practical terms, when a person purchases a CD, for $10,000, the person provides $10,000 to the bank. The bank deposits that money into a special account that corresponds to that particular certificate of deposit. This account is located in and managed by the Bank of the Federal Reserve where it can be insured. The bank then issues a certificate that gives the customer the right to withdraw that deposit plus interest after a specified period of time at a specified interest rate. If the person would like to redeem his or her CD prior to the end of the specified term, there is also a specified fee that the person would have to pay to redeem his or her CD sooner than originally specified. While this instrument is excellent as a secure asset protected from inflation, it could also be a secure tool to convert USD into tokens redeemable for a dollar. It will be inexpensive for the Credit Union to pay the Fed to generate a daily statement of the amount of USD in each insured account (https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/accounting/daily-statement.html). 
Credit Unions are non-profit organizations owned by their members whose mission is to support their communities. I am partnering with my local credit union to develop a tool to enable the purchase of CDs with the certificate itself as a set of tokens on the blockchain with a one-to-one correspondence between the number of tokens and the number of insured dollars in the account. These CDs will have no penalty for being redeemed at any time, and as a result, they will not pay interest. Rather, they will just be used to easily and inexpensively convert between stable tokens and USD in a safe and secure way.
Each CD token (CDT) will belong to an asset class with metadata that describes its date of issuance, the institution that issued it, and the account at which its funds can be found. At any time, any CDT will be able to be returned to its bank of issuance and redeemed for its face value from its associated account. When CDT is returned to its bank, it will be burned. Depending on the institution, it ought to be the case that the only fees will be the Cardano transaction fees as banks and credit unions will benefit by being able to offer a greater variety of securities and services to their customer base which will itself expand as the reach of the institution will expand to that of the entire Cardano network.
In the Metadata Challenge, I will submit a proposal to create a metadata server that will monitor the state of audited accounts against the state of their on-chain representations. This will allow consumers to freely transact in different issuances of stable tokens from different institutions and allow wallet applications to treat them as being interchangeable.
This will be good for my local community because I would like to be able to employ the homeless via smart contracts. I would also like to decrease the amount that local businesses have to pay in fees to the Visa-Mastercard network. These benefits extend to any community all over the world with a reliable stable token. So long as the Federal Reserve exists, so as long as the US Dollar exists, these tokens will be secure, stable and protected.
Success in 3 months will be that in which we have a proof-of-concept running on the test net such that it has been integrated with Campus USA Credit Union's accounting systems and automated via the banking portal. Success in 6 months will constitute having scaled to users in Gainesville and having offered education to local businesses on how to accept payments and account using CDT on Cardano. At 12 months, if IOHK has implemented Babel fees, we should see mass local adoption in partnership with the City of Gainesville.
I do not expect to benefit financially in the near term, so if I could have $50 for transportation costs for my trips between my domicile and the Credit Union, it would be awesome.
I expect to have a public launch on or by February 1st, 2022.
Attached, I have included a working draft of the proposal that I am providing to the banks. It is a rough draft, but please judge it harshly. I will update it as quickly as possible as I refine my approach and finish my implementation.

⭐ Introduction
Climate change disaster, biodiversity collapse, degradation and artificialization of soils, depletion of energy and mineral resources, economic and political instabilities: the current crisis is alarming for agriculture. Agriculture accounts for 70% of water use and ⅓ of the food produced is either lost or wasted, the sector need profound change in the food production and consumption habits. More than 475 millions smallholders are the first impacted by climate change. They have less and less visibility on their production have to secure a growing demand for fresh and healthy products and responde to industial standards at the same time. To protect smallholders two distinct systems were developed: farmers cooperative and community shared agriculture (CSA).
Farmers cooperatives have emerged to give farmers social and economical benefits, enhance farmers' bargaining power, reduce trading cost, collecte funds and bring environmental incentive for consumers to trust farmers. Inside a cooperative a smallholder can brand his product in a larger market , and coordinate his production resulting in higher and better product quality. [1] Cooperatives have seen difficulties in working with big retailers' supply chains: unfair practices such higher prices on the wholesale market sale, monopoly on vegetable production and products rejections. It was challenging for retailers firm to integrate small scale farm due to complex transaction process and supply chain integration.
CSA is a local farm production-marketing and partnership between farmers and consumers that include (a) conservation of ecosystem (b) farm work support and payment in advance (c) suffisent income from the CSA which compensates for the cost of farm production [2] (d) sharing the risk. In practice, the community of shareholders funds the operation of a local farm at the beginning of the growing season in exchange for weekly deliveries of fresh produce and other food products (eggs, dairy, meats) over the course of the harvesting period. It's beneficial for farmers that are insured against risks of potential environmental factors leading to low crop yield, and consumers, who gain abilities to influence decisions such as crop production ratios to better suit the needs of the community. However CSA faces many challenges including natural disasters and scale expansion.
💸 Market perspectives
Farmers cooperatives market is a global market that generates economy and employment. In the United States around 3000 farmer cooperatives, including 1.9 Millions farmers generate 8 B USD every year [2] . In Europe, the total turnover of the 100 largest agricultural coops in 2019 was estimated at 237 billion euros. France only has more than 2,850 agricultural co-operatives with a collective turnover of 83.7 billion Euro. In China the development of farmers cooperatives is growing at a fast pace. By the end of October 2019, the number of registered farmer cooperatives is estimated at 2.2 millions. In South Africa, Farmers cooperatives play an important role for smallholders to access markets [3] .
Since 1970, CSA has developed from Japan [4] and Switzerland to the US and spread across Europe and China. With more than 300 projects in operation in China in 2019.[5] With 7398 farms in 2019 in the US CSA market was valued at 226 millions USD [6]. The 3 main reasons evoked by consumers to get involved to buy products in a CSA model are the sustainable production, the healthy and high quality food [7].
Blockchain food to table traceability solution help across various stages of the global supply chain and ensure safety efficiency and accountability for farmers. This market that will reach 886 million in 2025, is targeted by many startups (AgUnity, Agriledger, Farmer Connect, The New Fork) that work closely with farm cooperative. However these solutions are highly centralized,not open source and cannot be run by communities or cooperatives themself. Other blockchain application such productionownership, community cooperation, and locally self-sufficient economies are alos under exploited. This application can directly participate to CSA transactions between farmers and consumers and help governments and NGOs to help farmers cooperative.
🍅 Product
We introduce an open source marketplace run by cooperative or CSA community that protects smallholders and of direct transactions with buyers.
On one side the marketplace is permissioned by cooperatives to verify and integrate farmers to a local farm group (also called Drive) . The platform will provide a console for farmers to manage and distribute his products as NFT (cf. Fund6 | NFT Busines model | Digital Twin NFT for farm products).
On the other side, the marketplace is public and help customers to look for the closest Drive pick up point by searching around their location. The buyer journey will be the following: inspect and pick up several products, place an order, choose to have a free deliver at a pick-up place (Drive stand) or pay to get delivered at home by a courier. (1) Buyers make orders directly from several farmers and can only add product in the course of the week (farmers have limited time and production).
When the online order is complete, the marketplace will distribute all the paiement confirmation in real time to all the farmers, and farmer for them to prepare their products (2) Once a week, Farmers send their products to the drive. (3) buyers will either pick-up their food basket at the Drive or if available, to choose a courier to get delivered at home. The marketplace gives the opportunity for any buyer to invest in farmers' pre-seed production several months in advance then participating in a CSA project.
This marketplace can also include multiple application that help farmers local groups to sell products. An agricultural asset map can help a consumer to explore available products and connect farmers products with buyers. Farmers cooperative can also choose to give a fee to working groups that saves cooperative needs for marketing, selling, product management, insurance to only left food production quality and sustainable production (cf.Diagrams). Two cooperatives will also be able to do NFT swapping thus both of the cooperatives will have more offers and be capable of reaching new consumers directly even from more distant cities. Finally this marketplace can develop green delivery system (bike, electricity courrier) in order to be even more sustainable and autonomous.
🎯 Acquisition
Cooperatives and farmers acquisition
The marketplace need to prove to the cooperative its a easy and reliable way for farmers to operate transaction locally. NFT transition will bring more technical power to cooperative and allow them to be more autonomous and independent and at the same time more align with agro-food industrial standards.
We can also develop a dedicated staking pool dedicated for decentralized agriculture where farmers and ADA holders will jointly expand the cardano ecosystem and ADA adoption.
Buyers and consumers acquisition
The marketplace will give new incentives for consumers to protect and access healthy food from local production, ensure security and traceability, reduce packaging, food waste and delivery emission. On chain transaction from consumers to farmers with cryptocurrency will strengthen the local supply and demand.
🧐 Monopoly
The marketplace is open source, run by farmer group /community themself thus aim to be scalable. Incentives will help farmers to create NFT of their products and sell them into a cooperative local market then the marketplace will be auto-scalable.
This dApp is a way for consumers to get information synchronized directly with smallholders cooperatives capacity and pay for their products directly. This approach will leverage cooperative economic power and build a new model less vulnerable and more resilient founded on local small farmers capacity.
💰 Show us the money
Fund will be divided between a Cardano associate developer and a Agricultural science research to work on the following deliverables:


A marketplace prototype that integrate farmers and consumers functionalities and ADA transactions.


A research paper on the NFT and blockchain adoption for farmers cooperatives and introduce the marketplace development and principles.


As a written agreement, funds will be diretly distributed to the two positions mentioned. The autor will actively work on research effort and quest for funds.
🚗 Getting on the road [soon]
For the next 3 months work on farmer console management and NFT product display and on the first part of the research paper. For the next 6 months the research paper will be completed and submitted, the platform should be able to integrate multiple farmers in one location and handle buyer transaction.
For the next 12 months the platform will be fully operational, buyers should be able to make paiments to multiple farmers and farmers able to receive transaction.
Defining success
Our mission is to open NFT to farmers for them to become a maker with the same level of technical, legal and bargaining power as agro-food industrial and decentralized agriculture.
By creating an online platform for farmers to become NFT maker we hope it will protect their ownership, products and prices, improve the supply chain freshness and access credit from collateral. Production will become responsive to local needs and supply chains will be structured around value creation.

In the existing information / media ecosystem, the truth of an idea is not the most important determiner of whether or not it is believed. Shared Reality is intended to change that. Part of that is an immutable source of truth, where all controversial documents can be warehoused and available in their original forms, without requiring the public to trust any person or institution. We also need this information to be presented by a distributed front-end which would ensure that the strongest rebuttals and counter-rebuttals are presented where they belong - right next to the assertions that form people's perceptions of reality.
 
The existing information ecosystem allows disinformation to thrive and prevents the public from having effective defenses against disinformation, propaganda, or active measures techniques.
 
For example:
 

It doesn't matter how many people are upset about a prevailing narrative. (For example, whether vaccines do or do not cause autism.) It doesn't matter how upset they are. And, it doesn't matter how much time goes by. They can never take meaningful steps to resolve their discomfort. Their mental health and relationships can suffer.

 

Any entity with enough resources can create paralysis on any issue by injecting disinformation into the public mind whenever they see public consensus building against them. Controversies and problems are never resolved. New controversies, also never resolved, are introduced regularly.

 

When people want to know about climate change, they hear from pundits, magazines, and media conglomerates instead of hearing directly from actual climate scientists. Before the Internet, this made sense. Now, however, it's an outdated, inefficient, costly, and dangerous way to manage an information ecosystem.

 
We are currently living through an information war. Our trust has been very skillfully manipulated over decades in a divide and conquer process called Active Measures (or Ideological Subversion). Either the 2020 US presidential election was stolen or it wasn't. The existing media will not be resolving this controversy. If they were, they would have done it a long time ago. We need new tools to address and resolve this situation, or we can likely expect the worst.
 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community
""The aide said that guys like me were 'in what we call the reality-based community,' which he defined as people who 'believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.' [...] 'That's not the way the world really works anymore,' he continued. 'We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors...and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do'.""
- From a George W Bush senior White House aide, in 2004.
 
That does appear to be how it's sorting out. I hope we are all on the same page about that. Competing realities are being manufactured and people are living their lives inside these Big Lies. We need better weapons in the war against disinformation.
 
Shared Reality will provide the tools the public needs in order to protect itself from the Big Lie and other tactics which are now being used to destabilize Western-style democracies. 
 
The key to shifting this paradigm is frictionless, two-way communication between the people who know things and the people who want to know those things - especially across social boundaries (like political party affiliation).
 
A centralized version of such a platform can be found in a closed beta state at https://sharedreality.solutions . The missing next features are a blockchain-based data store and distributed front-end. This proposal includes the creation of a read-only front-end for non-authenticated public users. Other features (for adding and organizing information, etc) will be made distributed in the future.
 
I'm looking for developers and others to help make this a reality. Please reach out with feedback, etc. Thank you

https://www.etags.com/blog/what-is-a-car-repossession-and-how-does-it-hurt-your-credit-score/
For every 2.4 cars sold 1 will be reposessed.  A repossession can negatively affect a borrower for 7 years.  The goal of the DAAP would be to put electric vehicles in the hands of those who want/need them and to allow investors to be part of something they believe in.  Accessible financing for clean transportation.  If we can provide users with a less risky, lower priced loan while being backed by a better asset, the electric car, we can keep monthly payments low enough to be competitive with traditional internal combustion vehicles with high predatory rates.  20% predatory loan practices are common for the used auto sales.
Car ownership is near a must in some places in the US.  Commuting 2 hours by bus each way is not feasible for most if a car gets repo'd. Not having a car might limit your Once a credit score becomes ruined by a repo it becomes more difficult to get an apartment to rent. This can spiral and add stress to people already under financial pressure.  Electric cars are usually more expensive than internal combustion cars (ICE's) so they are out of reach of many low income car buyers.  The caveat is that electric cars will likely last 300-500K miles without much repair.  A great example would be a 2013 Chevy volt that would cost around $9,000.  These vehicles will also save their owners around $1000-2500 per year in gas and maintenance.  This should free up capital for the owner to repay the loan.  The one issue might be charging but some counties are now requiring charging stations at apartments.    The DAPPS goal is to make electric vehicles accessible and to set low income folks up for financial success.   The more successful people in the world the safer and more well off all of us are.  The DAPP would allow allow Cardano members to participate in funding rounds.  The funding rounds would set aside cash for the length of the loan, likely 5 years.  These funding rounds would take the form of tokens which would have a fluctuating value based on demand.  As funds are paid back by users the DAPP would purchase the tokens back from Token owners at a set interest rate.  The benefit of doing a token is it allows investors to back out of the investment if they need their funds for something else. Interest purchases of the tokens could happen as often as weekly or could follow Cardano's staking timeline.  If for some reason alot of users pulled out of their investments the price of the token would drop and thereby be a better return for new investors.  The token would have an end value of $100 at the end of 5.5 years.  The initial value of the token would be around $71 and continue to increase given the repayment of loans.  The funding rounds would occur every quarter or so. If funds are unused after 3 months the funds would roll into new tokens of the same value in the next funding round.  This allows the Daap to fluctuate funding for loans based on demand.  Funds would be held in cash.  Say the token repurchase happened every epoch this would keep the price of the token consistent.  We would divide the token up by the epoch with interest included so that every 3 days a repurchase of a percentage of your token would occur.  By having regular repurchases the price of the token should remain relatively stable and liquid although people pulling out of their investment would likely do so at a small loss.  We might want to provide a mechanism for people to exit their position during new funding rounds so that new investors can take their place.
 
The tenants of the DAPP would be as follows. 


qualified plug in electrics or hybrids are applicable for the loan.  We would review the borrower's income, cash they have available commuting requirements and make car make and model recommendations.  Borrowers who are attempting to purchase too much car for their income will be rejected.  We want to encourage responsible borrowing.  Electric vehicles hold their value much better the ICE's so there is less risk to the DAAP


The company would be the holder of the assets until loan paid off as collateral 


Loans could be delayed for up to 1 year without interest payments  or more given they pay interest payments and keep in contact with the company.  The user would not have to give a reason for being unable to pay.  This allows for life to happen, medical bills, being laid off, natural disasters, unexpected costs of moving, debt repayment to happen.  As long as the user stays in contact with the company, pays off interest if required and sends time stamped photos of the assets no actions will be taken. 


4)  Part of the organizations mission is financial education, this could include videos recommendations to borrowers regarding credit card debt, managing budgets, shopping for health, car, home insurance, improving credit scores.  Another aspect would be a secure messaging system for which borrowers could send video messages to the DAPP employees letting them know how they are doing financially and how the program has helped them.  It might be a mandatory condition of getting a loan so that the DAPP developers can better cater to borrowers and put a human face to their work.  The videos would not be shared without consent.  These videos could be great marketing material for future funding rounds.


Interest rates would be reasonable. Lets say no more than 4% over inflation.  In today's environment I would hope for rates no higher than 6-8%.  


Standard repossession practices would be in place if contract is broken 


A friend must vouch for you and provide a real name and address.  We will send this person a packet describing our company and try to encourage them to get an EV.  This is not a co-signer, just a real person so that the system isn't taken advantage of and that there is some assurance the person is of good nature.


The organization would be positive for borrowers credit score 


the DAPP (individuals backing loans and the borrowers) would agree to donate 1% total to a fund that would provide charging stations where needed in the US or abroad. A percentage would go back into the DAAP's fund to ensure its financial future.


The application will be automated and online.  Automatic payments would be encouraged


The loans would be paid directly via wire transfer to car dealerships or approved car buying websites.  This ensures that there is a transaction occurring, all appropriate taxes are being paid and titles can be mailed back to us.  


Borrowers would have to provide proof of employment


 

There is no income threshold and the lower the risk of the applicant the lower the interest amount.  An ideal applicant might be someone who can realistically only afford a $5000 vehicle and can't put any money down or it might be someone who wants a used model 3 for $25K and is putting down $10K

 
 
 
Funds will go towards setting up banking requirements, paying for developers to develop website and phone apps for android and apple, marketing.  Our primary marketing would be web based, maybe on youtube or google.  Anyone looking for used cars would be our target audience.  We would also need staff to help educate borrowers, execute title transfers and handle delinquent borrowers.
 
I have no specific skills as far as programming but have the drive to see something like this to completion and the willingness to put together a great team around me to make electric cars accessible to the masses.
Definition of success:
Success after 3 months:  1) hire technology team to help with web development 2) put together a youtube video to describe our progress.  3) hire business development employee 5) hire accountant
 
Success after 6 months: 1) assess the scale of the opportunity/addressable market. Use this data to set initial funding goals and token issuance. 2)  layout timeline for testing DAAP
 
Success after 12 months: 1) successfully test DAAP via blockchain 2) successfully transact a pilot project loan with multiple dealers
Success after 18 months: 1)Successfully transact a pilot loan in multiple states, assess need abroad and transact in another country
 
Success after 24 months: Roll out first round of tokens for funding round.
 
Our proposal impacts the challenge of a glut in car repossessions by providing reasonable rates to people who otherwise have terrible credit and no means to get a reasonable rate.  We provide a means for borrowers to repay these loans by getting them into electric vehicles which have lower operating costs.  We provide flexibility. Life happens, people lose jobs, their financial situations change. Too often people purchase too much vehicle and we will do our best to prevent this.  We might have options for a person to downgrade their vehicle to meet their current budget.
 
Budget requirements are as follows compensation includes employee benefits


Business Development employee-$100-150K annually


Accountant $100-150K annually


Marketing-$300k annually


4)  3 technology developers-  $600k annually
5)  Other overhead $500K
 
This should give us runway for at least 2-3 years before we can start self funding from the loan business

The website https://adafolio.com currently hosts over 100 diverse portfolios of stake pools and allows community members to create, update, and share these portfolios manually. Our goal is to improve the usability of this community-focused tool by adding an Application Programming Interface (API) to allow third-party organizations and services to curate and consume the portfolios. By providing this service, we will effectively connect delegators to the pools that support the causes and projects that are important to them, thereby strengthening both the network and the community.
The upgrade will consist of two thrusts:
1. Develop an easy-to-use API for projects and organizations to automate the process of curating custom portfolios hosted by adafolio. The estimated time and cost for this is three months and $5000.
It is our goal to make the process of creating and updating portfolios easier for groups and organizations by providing an API for them to automate the curation of their portfolios. For example, consider a self-organized group that vets stake pools making donations to charity. The API will allow them to update a potentially large portfolio of stake pools much faster and with fewer errors.
2. Develop the API for interfacing the curated portfolios with wallets and other services. Refer to CIP-0017 for details on the proposed integration. An API is essential for projects and wallets to consume the community-generated portfolios. A rudimentary API currently exists for our integration with https://pooltool.io. The estimated time and cost for this upgrade is three months and $5000.

A patient-centric blockchain-based data marketplace system. This system addresses data transactions, exchanges, and control/privacy specifications using Cardano blockchain technology to encrypt patients data as decentralized
storage.
GELMA wants to allow patients to have full control over their medical data to provide pseudonymity and anonymity financial identity and reward mechanisms. Data is stored on the Cardano blockchain to achieve security, integrity, and accountability. Cryptographic functions are employed to provide immutability and eliminate data protection vulnerabilities. 
The proposed system is divided into two levels: the first level contains a Registration Unit where the authentication is done, a Private Accessible Unit (PAU) that acts as an intermediary between patient users, data buyers, and blockchain, and a decentralized app (DApp) for the patient to interact with the system. The second level represents the system backend (the permissioned blockchain) which contains the security-level elements of the proposed system.
Why GELMA and why now?
• Patient Data Personalisation – The prospect of more individualized 'n=1' healthcare data is accelerating.
• Remote access, localized support, and decision making are all central to creating more personalized information which in turn will drive better healthcare, precision medicine, and personalized treatment (e.g. gene therapy, genomics)
• Predictive analytics and genetic profiling will further transform treatments and the way pharmaceutical and biotech companies process patient data: mRNA, DNA, Genome Sequencing, etc.
Overview
• DApp for patient's data exchange to enable patient financial identity and allow patient data control to the corresponding owners.
• What is driving this business plan? Patients from all kinds of therapeutical areas and diseases should be able to control and benefit from their own data.
We want as well to promote data privacy, build trust and transparency from patient data exchanges with healthcare institutions, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and supply chain players.
• Our vision: We want a world where trust, transparency, and authenticity are core values in the post-digital and post-COVID19 version of commerce between patients and institutions. We are on a mission to use Cardano's and leading healthcare and pharmaceutical partners to bring this vision to life.

CLANITY CONNECTS BUSINESSES AND CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR BLOCKCHAIN REWARDS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM 
 
Clanity is the first blockchain technology that attempts to simplify and efficiently reward a large number of individuals who make subjective contributions to local businesses all around the world with a universal utility token.
 
Clanity as a solution
PROBLEM
Underutilized blockchain-based value additions
Blockchain is the most disruptive technology of the century but its adoption has not been warmly welcomed by the masses due to its technicality and lack of real world use case.
SOLUTION
Introduce Blockchain in the underrepresented rewards functions
We will provide a platform that is easy to use and of value so our community will have sustainable massive gains from joining Clanity which will be the catalyst for adoption.
PROBLEM
Online competitors challenging local physical retailers
With e-commerce and online retailers building market share over the past decade, brick-and-mortar companies are in trouble trying to keep up. This trend is causing less foot traffic to traditional business.
SOLUTION
Bring foot traffic to business partners
We will be reinventing the process of how businesses acquire new loyal customers. Clanity will offer efficient ways of targeting customers and effectively convert them into purchasing customers.
PROBLEM
Inefficient rewards programs
About 50% of loyalty program members are inactive. Many never engage or they opt out after a month. It lacks differentiation, fails to gain attention or attract new members and retain existing members.
SOLUTION
Universally revolutionize the rewards program
Clanity puts the customer at the center of our rewards program to drive results by enabling technologies that enhance the customer experience, and offer value propositions that are financially incremental.
PROBLEM
Decreased funding in local public schools
Countries are already cutting their education budgets to make space for the required spending on health and social protection. The hugely affected students mostly fall disproportionately on the poorest and most vulnerable.
SOLUTION
Supports low funded schools or high impact nonprofit organizations
Part of Clanity's goal is to support low funded schools and high impact nonprofits to ensure that the younger generation is well equipped to take over the responsibilities of world innovation.
PROBLEM
Data exploit by corporate giants
Once you sign the terms of service online to use a software, the organization gains control over your data. It might be surprising to know that not all major companies sell data because it is valuable. Companies that do sell data, get the money and the users get nothing.
SOLUTION
Users control and own their data
We respect our users' privacy. We want our users to have control and own their data. Allowing users to sell their own data for self-monetization to business partners.
 
Platform
Clanity plans to create platforms that are beautifully designed, simple and easy to use yet very well architectured and robust for both tech savvy and non-technical users.
User Friendly Design
Scalability & Quick Transaction Time
Minimal Transaction Fees
Trust & Transparency
Security
 
Clanity offers several uses that go beyond the normal peer to peer trading of cryptocurrency. We plan to go mainstream and ensure mass adoption.
 
Clanity's Planned Ecosystem and Funding Breakdown
CLANwallet $50,000
Integrates, processes and holds rewards, and also serves as a wallet for users.
CLANswap $50,000
Easily trade Cardano, Cardano native tokens and possibly other cross-chain cryptocurrencies with your Clanity tokens.
CLANbuzz $50,000
Materialize the community engagement and reward efforts for business partners and community members.

In this challenge I look to build a dapp and integrate it with the cardano ecosystem. With this gamification social media I look to build on top with this platform a NFT collector edition so people can sell rare clothing with there avatar character on it and it will have a QR code to scan the that the item is stored on the blockchain. We will do this after 3 months within launch then after 6 months we look to build more on the ecosystem incentivising reward for stake on the cardano blockchain with earning points on are platform. In 12 months we look to start getting influencers to start joining are platform earning them official reps of the platform and be a content creator on the platform. For the budget will be broken down like this we will use a 1/3 of the budget on developer needs 1/3 of the budget on marketing and another on designing. We looking to have a budget of £250,000 by then but we look to start off slow with a MVP first then when more funding comes we build more. The expected launch date will be next year February 2022 with hoping that all the right things are in place by then.

A privacy centric and secure digital identity solution which can be easily integrated for KYC in blockchain services such as DEX",2,"Saturday, 21 August 2021 05:03",Kai Jun Eer,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Kai-Jun-Eer/3064371-48088,,,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Many of the decentralised exchanges such as Binance are facing increasing regulatory pressure. In fact, Binance is slowly pivoting towards centralised practices such as users are required to undergo KYC in order to access the full suite of services. Currently, the KYC process requires users to submit a picture of their government IDs and the process could take up to 20 days. This is inefficient and will raise many privacy concerns. While the blockchain is pseudonymous in nature, regulatory for financial services might result in more blockchain services needing to comply to KYC rules in the near future. 
A digital identity solution that complies to the KYC rules will most probably have to be a unique ID system, meaning each person could only own one such ID. To achieve this, we need government to be the identity issuers. Each identity is stored in a digital wallet owned by the identity owner, while the identity claim is recorded in a smart contract on the Cardano blockchain. This timeline is in line with the Alonzo rollout plan. The concept is similar to self sovereign identity (SSI), however to ease integration into existing systems of decentralised exchanges, we plan to implement a set of APIs that could be called for identity verification and authentication. 
To provide a clearer picture of how it works, we will be building a platform portal, where identity issuers will issue identity credentials through this portal to identity owner's digital wallet. The portal will automatically record the identity claim in the smart contract. When the identity owner is required to perform KYC in decentralised exchanges, the identity owner will present the identity credentials to the verifier (the exchange). The verifier will then verify the authenticity of the credential through our portal, by calling the verification APIs, which essentially is a verification call to the smart contract, however abstracted away from the end users. 
Roadmap: First 4 months will be focusing on implementing the infrastructure, which includes identity issuance, storage and verification. We plan to leverage on existing open-source digital wallets for identity storage, and customise it to suit our needs. The subsequent 2 months will be focusing on community onboarding, which includes starting with onboarding a local / municipal government to be our pilot identity issuer, onboarding at least 100 users as our pilot identity owner, and onboarding 2 decentralised exchanges as our pilot identity verifiers for KYC purposes. 
Success metrics: 3 months - done with basic implementation of the digital identity infrastructure, starting on security auditing and QA testing. 6 months - Pilot identity issuers, identity owners and identity verifiers onboarded as users. Identify features for improvements. 12 months - Iteratively improve on features based on users feedback, manage to onboard a national government as an identity issuer, thereby increasing user base exponentially
Budget: 15000 USD for development cost in the first four months, which include hiring a full stack developer. 5000 USD for marketing cost, which includes online publicity, and cost for a part-time growth hacker. 
Expected public launch date: February 1st 2022.

Desired Outcome
To provide a Cardano blockchain based ticket selling marketplace for live and virtual events powered by smart contracts
Blocking problem
Legacy ticket sellers are middlemen that place high fees on the actual good, with little prevention of scalping or fraud
Costs of the problem
Entertainment is one of the largest and fastest growing sectors in the world ($2.6 trillion by 2025). *1
Ticket scalpers market estimated to be $15.9B in 2020. *2 The largest ticket seller in the US made over 10B in revenue in 2019 *3.

Market: there is not yet a successfully implemented ticket sales platform on Cardano. Cardano is better suited than other blockchains to provide a backbone for a ticket service with the described functionality due to its speed, decentralization, security, scalability, and low cost of transactions. There is a huge market and opportunity for artists, venues and other entertainers to directly connect to fans with little to no middleman fees and markup, empowering more people to access their experiences, services and events. Our product will incorporate codified ethos to prevent common problems in the ticket and event services sector like scalping, misaligned reseller incentives, frontrunning, ticket transfer risk, proof of purchase, verifiable authenticity, and fair ticket payment plans.
Scalping: We will limit the number of orders that can be obtained within a certain time frame from any one purchasing address or account
Misaligned reseller incentives: We can provide an opt-in service to event organizers to algorithmically determine a fair price based on the proportion of tickets that are fully sold vs unsold, creating a fair value guarantee for ticket purchases.
Frontrunning: we will always be able to display the cost the reseller paid for the ticket to the buyer, reducing the chance for exorbitant markups. Accounts that are found to purchase tickets purely for the intent of reselling at a profit will have their purchasing ability limited even further than the default scalping logic would enforce.
Ticket transfer risk: We can provide secure 3rd party escrow, with proof of funds and proof of ticket ownership to ensure neither party is a bad actor with malicious intent, while still transferring tickets quickly and cheaply.
Proof of purchase: A digital NFT can be generated with each ticket sale, so that even after the ticket is used and the event is past, the attendee can have a free memorabilia and badge to proudly collect and display.
Verifiable authenticity: We can leverage the blockchain to ensure no duplicate tickets are sold and that the tickets are indeed created by the provider of the event or an affiliate. If the provider elects to have an affiliate sales reward program, this will easily be trackable with payments disbursed in near real-time as well.
Fair ticket payment plans: A buyer of a ticket can enter into a contractual agreement to purchase a ticket in installments. Any buyer who fails to provide the funds in full by a predetermined date will automatically forfeit the ticket to auction, where it can be purchased for the difference between what has been paid and the remaining balance for non-sold out events, or auctioned to the highest bidder in the case the event is sold out. Any funds above the fair market price will be used to reimburse the original purchaser a portion or all of their funds.
Budget: The primary use of the budget will be to fund dedicated remote developers to create the required smart contracts, plus a simple web client to facilitate more rapid iteration and testing. Additional funds may be sought in a later round of fundraising to establish partnerships with venues and entertainment companies, as well as for marketing initiatives. There is a separate proposal to fund mobile developers to develop a client app, empowering those around the world access on mobile devices, which is the dominant way citizens of the globe access the web. We would like to devote full time developers to this project, and estimate 1 full stack web developer, and 2 smart contract developers, plus a project manager will be sufficient at this stage for phase one. We are seeking $62,000 to hire and fund these roles for a 3-6 month time period (length depending on full or part time).
Roadmap: in the first month, we will finalize our agreements with the talent required to develop the smart contracts, create a more granular map of the work to be done and begin to code. Our initial focus will be on creating the underlying smart contracts and a simple web client, while the mobile team that has submitted their own proposal works on building out a full-fledged enterprise grade iOS and android app. This will allow us to reach the majority of the world's population despite many citizens having a mobile device with internet access, yet no computer, while also supporting access from a wide variety of end clients, regardless of browser or operating system. We will leverage an open source cross-platform mobile development platform for this task (React & React Native). The founding team has extensive experience using open source technologies to develop, launch and maintain enterprise grade web and mobile applications used by hundreds of thousands of users monthly.
By month three we aim to have begun testing and vetting the foundational smart contracts to enable interacting with the ticket platform. This includes listing, purchasing, and transferring ownership of the tickets. We will then turn our attention to the more sophisticated smart contracts that will differentiate our platform from legacy providers, enabled by the Cardano blockchain.
By month six we will provide additional functionality empowered by smart contracts as outlined above, like built-in scalper/bot detection and rejection, split payment contracts, and a reseller system.
Our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the first 6 months of the project will include shipping an initial version of the web client, deploying multiple iterations of the smart contracts on the Cardano Testnet, and beginning to integrate with the mobile client frontend for android and iOS.
Our year 1 KPIs will be to successfully deploy our vetted contracts to the Cardano mainnet, acquire at least 1 partnership with a venue or event organizer, and list tickets for sale to at least 1 pilot event. Our anticipated launch date would be August 2022.
IP: Our IP policy is to provide open source contracts for the vast majority of our logic, with only sensitive details of personal information or logic that may hinder our ability to fairly serve each user obfuscated from public view. We intend to provide our services for an industry leading ""middle-man fee"", and provide access to an API connected to our platform within a reasonable usage limit for free to spur additional development and accessibility options to the end user.
This project will be deemed successful if we bring to market a low-cost, frictionless experience to the end user to allow more people to enrich their lives with virtual and in person experiences from performing arts to business conventions, while empowering a more direct sales approach from artists and venues to attendees.

Creating a gamified curriculum that engages children and allows them to learn at their own pace. Offering a holistic practical education.",2,"Saturday, 21 August 2021 01:06",cryptocranston,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/cryptocranston/3086720-48088,,,7500,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This could be a great addition to Cardano's work in Africa as a great place to build out new curriculum and way of learning based on the same principles as Elon Musk's Ad Astra School. The Idea is to have it available on the blockchain so parents anywhere in the world home school there children with ease due to the bulk of the educational content being specially developed games with learning verification monitored by AI. Along with real world challenges that can be verified back to the blockchain via evidence of completion. The hope would be to communicate with governments of lesser developed countries and work with them to provide high quality educational resources to struggling communities and home-schoolers all around the world. As the system gets verified it could start to integrate into more 1st world countries. Ideally creating a more unified approach to education globally.  This is an educational system that will not leave kids behind disinterested and feeling stupid and not good enough.  This system engages children and works with them at their level what ever that level may be. If a child is a scholar in maths but not very good with language he/she could be doing year 12 maths and year 7 English etc. But the biggest advantage is the teachers can then focus on the social, emotional and philosophical aspects of education. Student can interact and work in teams with other children of varying ages. Teaching teamwork and co-operation to solve real world problems is something missing in todays schools and will help children intergrate smoothly into well functioning teams as they begin work.
 
Please check out my initial whitepaper that has been attached v0.2
 
This is a huge idea far outside my capabilities. I believe it is a very worthy idea and much like the adoption of blockchain itself the transformation of our education systems is inevitable. I feel like this is a project that needs to be done right which is why I think it is a great fit for the Cardano ecosystem. I think it would require heavy use of AI integrations which would also be a great project for Sing.Net and Cardaon to work together and show the world what they are capable of. I have yet to approach the sing.net team to see what is involved in creating an AI to manage the system and weather it is possible to integrate them into the games themselves to create constant variation at a suitable difficulty level.
I am going to refocus this funding proposal to give me the green light to build a project roadmap with detailed pricing and to confirmed team members and partnerships. 
Basically I am reducing the amount of funding necessary to get the project to the point where it can start seeking funding outside of project catalyst.
This would involve working together with sing.net and developing a proof of concept game and management system so trials can be done to showcase the effectiveness of the online based system. 
It would also involve creating a detailed segment of the curriculum to show that it will promote well rounded, outgoing socially engaged children with plenty of activities to do and not just a race of hunch backed computer freaks which could potentially be the criticism.
I am estimating $7,500  
I may need a we bit of price appreciation along the way but I feel this works well within the guidelines of what project catalyst is trying to achieve. It leaves plenty of funding for other projects and devs that can get to work right away on projects that may not take long to build. 
For those that have read this far I thank you for your time and please leave some feedback for me down below.
 
Finalizing My Proposal.
I do receive emails from Project Catalyst.
Will upload ID- Check attachments
How my proposal impacts the challenge. Building dapps and integrations on Cardano Blockchain to attract more users. 
My proposal would create an entire ecosystem of life long users for the Cardano Blockchain. If it is successful enough to get significant amount of adoption which is the goal it will bring millions maybe 100s of millions of users who will spend many years interacting with the Cardano Blockchain and also ideally Singularity net will be providing many AI calls to School of Life as well. Upon re read of the challenge brief I see the goal is for 2021. This project will not be ready for 2021.
Definition of Success after 3months- Funding received and initial trial curriculum material established. Working gamifing the lessons and AI integration.
6months- Trial curriculum completed with AI monitored learning games that can adjust level to suit performance of the student. Activity lessons planed out with feedback portal to the School of Life as proof of real world activities being carried out tested and completed. Within funding limits or more funding achieved to maintain progress.
12months- Trial work has been carried out on real school children with ongoing updates and improvements being implemented. More funding for a more complete product in the works or achieved and growing the team and support for the project.
Expected public launch date. This will depend entirely on funding and teambuilding to achieve the goals. I would expect 1 year after the trial to build an age 7 to 11 complete primary school package ready for launch. With the work continuing for many years and indefinitely building out a full scale education system spanning all ages, languages and subjects. 
My expected launch date would be at earliest Q4 2022 unless there is significant interest and assistance given to the project.
How do I address the challenge question? I struggle to differentiate this from the above ""How dose my proposal impact the challenge. However on the question of how to bring more users to the cardano ecosystem via dapps and integrations I think I have put forward a very good proposal. If Cardano can become known as the blockchain of education it will have a never ending supply of millions of users who will be using the blockchain all of there lives. Obviously this will also help the success of other dapps on the chain because they will have a large pool of users already on the chain to draw from. I am very open about the fact that building this out properly sits well outside my current capabilities. I need many more resources than I currently have available. I would hope developers would see and like the idea and choose to be part of the project and the project will be able to reward them appropriately. I think this is a project that would span the entire career  for many developers. 
Budget breakdown- The budget is only a small portion of what is needed but $2000 would go towards researching and building the learning material over the first 3 months. The remaining $5500 will be put towards building out a trial game with AI monitoring. Giving us a proof of concept . I am hoping to entice extra value for the money spent by offering devs a stake in the project.

What is Cardax
Cardax is a decentralized exchange powered by the EAMM protocol. It aims to provide liquidity to projects that issue native tokens on Cardano.
 
Why Cardax
The Mary hard fork (done on March 1st 202) allowed anyone to build native assets on Cardano. Native tokens will bring multi-asset support to Cardano, allowing users to create uniquely defined (custom) tokens and carry out transactions with them directly on the Cardano blockchain.
This, together with the upcoming release of Goguen (smart contract), will allow teams to build descentralized applications on Cardano. It will also allow projects that already exist on Ethereum to start migrating to Cardano.
This is, of course, great news but it also presents a new challenge since there is currently no decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cardano. So tokens built on the Cardano netwrok don't have a 'native exchange' to list yet.
Cardax aims to be that 'native exchange' for the Cardano ecosystem.
What makes Cardax different to other DEXs like Uniswap, IDEX or Sushiswap
Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), in order to provide a market price, usually rely on one of the following systems: Order Book or Automated Market Maker (AMM).
So, which one is better? Our team has been researching the different systems for a few months and came to the following conclusion: it depends on the kind of tokens you want to serve on the exchange.
The Order Book model works best when the exchange offers trading pairs that have high liquidity (e.g. BTC/ETH, ADA/USDT, BTC/BUSD). The majority of centralized exchanges use Order Books, including the biggest ones such as Binance, Bittrex or Coinbase. IDEX, a decentralize exchange for ERC-20 tokens, uses the order book model.
However, if a market is illiquid, order books don't work that well. You can make an order, but finding a match for it won't be as easy, and you'll have to wait a long time. This often means you will not be able to escape volatility and large spreads occurring in these situations.
Switcheo is an example of an order book style DEX. After 4 years of launching it has ony 7 BTC in daily volume. It is a bad experience for users who want to trade their assets. Because of the low liquidity users have to wait a long time, sometimes weeks, for an order to be completed. That is if the order can be completed at all. Many times orders stay just open without having been able to find a counterparty to trade with.
An Automated Market Maker model (this is the type that Uniswap uses), on the other hand, suits better if the exchange offers mainly pairs with low liquidity. The main advantage of an AMM system is that there will always be liquidity for otherwise illiquid markets — at least while there are enough people to invest in a liquidity pool.
However, what if there isn't enough liquidity around the desired price to fill a large market order? There could be a big difference between the price that you expect your order to fill and the price that it fills at. This difference is called slippage. This, together with impermanent loss are the main disadvantages of an AMM system.
Projects that issue their own token come to a DEX to find liquidity. Thoug a AMM system allows them to create a new pair (Bobtoken/ADA), it also means they need to have a enough capital in order to create a liquidity pool that is liqwid enough so that they don't end up with a high slippage if a large order is executed. So, the bigger the collateral, the more liquid the pool becomes and lower slippage happens when bigger orders are executed. This is a problem, because many new projects that will launch their own native tokenon Cardano will be small project that won't have a lot of capital upfront (at least they raise capital).
Also, AMM markets act as uninformed, as the price is set by a pricing algorithm rather than an order book. Read more about it on this article.
So, is there a way to get the best of the two worlds? Could we have a system that:
- Allows anyone to become a market maker by either starting a liquidity pool or participating in an existing one.
- Minimizes slippage
- Minimizes the risk of impermanent loss
- Provides more price transparency
- Allows token issuers to create a new pair without the need of big amouonts of capital to serve as collateral.
The Extended Automated Market Maker (EAMM) protocol
We are currently working on the protocol. This section will be updated as soon as we finish the work related to this task.

The Liquifi team is building a DEX protocol with fair exchange rates for traders and high APY for investors to attract more Cardano users.",5,"Friday, 20 August 2021 20:04",Igor Struchkov,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Igor-Struchkov/3100540-48088,b.kuznetsov,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/b-kuznetsov/3100819-48088,100000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Implementation of the Liquifi V2 protocol can reduce price slippage up to hundreds times as we do not need to scatter liquidity across thousands of tokens pairs. If average losses from slippage could be as large as $1M monthly, we can reduce them to $10K - this gives $990K of profit for traders every month.
The impermanent loss can reduce liquidity providers income by 10-20% of the invested assets. For a $100M pool it gives more than $10M losses. We can, first, decrease them in 10 times, giving $9M additional revenues; second, give liquidity providers additional revenues from slippage. This will result in significantly higher APY on the same volumes of trades.
Project roadmap:
10/09/2021 - Liquifi V2 on Cardano architecture and technical design
20/09/2021 - Prototype in the Alonzo Purple testnet released
20/10/2021 - Liquifi V2 protocol in the Cardano mainnet released (public launch)
01/11/2021 - Security audit of Liquifi V2 Plutus code
15/12/2021 - Launch LQF token bridging between BSC and Cardano
 
Impact on the challenge metrics
Implementation and launch of the efficient DEX protocol on Cardano will increase the number of viable applications on top of Cardano and attract users to the platform. Viability of the application will be supported by the fact that no AMM-based DEX is available on Cardano by now and Liquifi V2 will be among the first launched applications of this type. The efficiency of the protocol will allow highly competitive exchange rates that will bring transaction volumes to the project.
Liquidity providers will benefit from low impermanent loss and high APY on investments. New users will also be attracted to the platform by the farming and yield pools features. In general, the whole Cardano ecosystem will acquire more digital asset holders and increase platform capitalization.

Challenge
What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2021?
 
Problem
Gig apps offer their service providers insulting wages, making them dependent on tips from generous customers. At the same time they charge consumers exorbitant fees which often results in lower tips for the service providers. Businesses often report a loss of revenue when utilizing delivery apps due to high fees and overpriced promotional features. They misrepresent businesses by marking up store items and keeping the profits. Inefficiencies with in-app functionality leads to frustrations for all and loss of revenue for small businesses and contractors.
Additionally, gig-app workers and freelancers with diverse skill sets are forced to utilize multiple applications since each app is limited to a specific field. A straw poll on Reddit revealed that some gig app workers were using 4 apps on 3 phones to make just $25 per hour. Ultimately, the gig economy is rigged in favor of big businesses that profit largely off of small businesses desperate for more revenue, and the deceptive wage structure they use to compensate independent contractors.
 
Solution
Create a decentralized platform that empowers local markets to establish fare rates for goods and services. Reduce or remove unnecessary fees and commissions. Leverage crypto incentives to create a digital ecosystem for the independent workforce. Utilize smart contracts to create a service provider toolkit customizable for all industries. By creating a state of the art task marketplace powered by cutting edge technology we can successfully onboard millions of new users to the Cardano eco-system and inspire a new era of equity for the self employed.

Note: The IGIVIT project description, as described in Fund5 is available below for you to read. Most of the info is still relevant as our product has not changed since.
-
Goal:
With IGIVIT, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing the tools to help better deliver emergency relief and/or financial assistance to people and communities in need.
-
Fund6-Specific Rationale:
IGIVIT is now a proud member of Project Catalyst's Fund5 Cohort! We are so grateful to the community and thrilled to be allowed to move forward. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
-
As you might imagine, a lot of water has passed under the bridge since the start of this adventure and a lot of new ideas and questions; challenges and also opportunities, emerged along the way. We have learned a lot since the last months and realized we have so much more to learn. But we are more eager than ever to keep pushing the development of this exciting new space.
-
And now, great news: the initial phase, Phase 1, whose costs are covered by the reward from Fund5, is almost completed already! You can see the progress right here on Github: https://github.com/lokdao/igivit or https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSDBbRthkcaFy31D7jQCGmtDB1MPClfjx1gETiOu65BAamjWGpjusClXkgenacoxF3twa1NVN55j2TH/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=3000 
Our current state is a Figma prototype with no back-end yet. We are currently finalizing the colour schemes and so on. On Github, at this moment, we present black and white wireframes. New visuals to land soon, keep coming back!
-
It is now time to move forward with Phase 2; the object of this Fund6 proposal. In the upcoming phase, we will be aiming at transforming the Figma High-Fidelity Demo into a functioning website, with a standard database, but without the blockchain component integrated yet.
There will also be improvements to functionalities and features from the current demo wireframes.
Then we will be moving to Phase 3: where we will formally integrate within the Cardano blockchain as we have within our team our own Plutus Pioneer!
We also imagine integrating Atala Prism to our solution for everything related to identity validation.
_
Roadmap:
Here's an overview of the road ahead. Everyone will be able to follow the progress of the build on both our website (https://igivit.org), Github repository (https://github.com/lokdao/igivit) - right now filled with prototype images - and on our progress page (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wwbmTMB4dD3iUBr_gi_ygnFyannIAtXTJEdufRS0Vyo/edit?usp=sharing)
Phase 1 - Proof of Concept - April to September 2021 (in progress):
- High-Fidelity prototype (Figma) = Almost completed!
With Project Catalyst Fund5, we will be receiving a payment that will be used to reimburse those costs.
Again we want to say thank you to the participating members of the Cardano community for voting for us and, in a more general sense, for taking part in this pioneering governance system! :)

Phase 2 - Adding functionality - Q4 2021 (to start in earnest if we get funded !)
- Convert the Figma prototype into a functioning Proof of Concept (PoC); a web platform where each of the 7 user personas required can interact in a campaign. Limited to core functionalities at first, with the backend database but no blockchain integration yet.
Once completed, Phase 2 will deliver a functional PoC featuring the core pages that can then be used to demonstrate the value proposition and attract investors and potential partners
Phase 3 - The Alonzo Era - Q1 2022
- Complete conversion of the remaining prototype pages for the entire platform
- Integrate the application with the Cardano blockchain, via the development of smart contracts using Plutus
- Demo the PoC to advisors and the community
 
Phase 4 - Improvements, QA and Atala Prism Integration - Q2 2022
- Make modifications following comments
- Make UX/UI advanced design
- Perform Quality Assurance (QA)
- Integrate with Atala Prism for decentralized identity (to be confirmed)
 
Phase 5 - Charity Integration - Q3 2022
- Integrate within a charity organisation; create a campaign
 
Phase 6 - Hello World - Q4 2022
- Go Live: launch the first real-world campaign
___
Measures of success:
3 months - December 2021: Complete programming of the core pages for all 7 User Personas on a basic website with backend database but no blockchain connection yet.
6 months - March 2022: Start attaching the platform data to the Cardano blockchain

The team:
David Poulin or @mrvaralta (https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-poulin/) used to be a Creative Director for Cirque du Soleil and other entertainment companies. Being a crypto enthusiast and a Cardano fan, the pandemic pushed him to write down the initial idea for IGIVIT in a white paper and to design paper-prototypes (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bD-l9eQOUmiRrg_eE2SFA4Rk9OCh2Gc?usp=sharing). Even though he's not from the dev world, he has a very good understanding of this emerging technology and the new possibilities it can offer to the world.
Ludovic Grandclement or @gildor (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludovicgrandclement/) is an experienced Project Manager and Data Engineer. What's more: he was part of the Plutus Pioneer Program's first cohort and completed it (you can check out his NFT certification - https://pool.pm/d068fe47123ec4c86460eeb74c7d7765c67d2df295a3ac86d664ed45.PlutusFirstClassPhoto50).
The two joined forces during the Fund3 proposal process.

Budget:
Now, in order to accomplish this, we will need funds. This is why we are asking for 57,440.00$ USD.
How are we going to spend this money? You can find our detailed budget right here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aGPOVyPBh-RtTWHD5gKJ8EjWOmUV6s2NWJqOiKwemZ0/edit?usp=sharing
We calculated this amount based on fair estimations of the time needed to program this, of course, but also with a portion looking towards the future; to allow for the development of the core functionalities; the core concept and its business development.

IGIVIT Original Proposal Text:
Overview:
We are looking to build the donation platform of tomorrow. In essence, we seek to finance the creation of a new way of giving to charities by building an app that will ease the donation process, help manage campaigns and transparently display all data on the blockchain: it's called IGIVIT.
With IGIVIT, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing the tools to deliver financial assistance and/or emergency relief to the people and communities in need. We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized app allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.
Currently, when giving to a charity, it is very hard to know how the funds are really being used. This opacity in the donation process prevents a lot of people from making contributions. Now, imagine being able to know exactly, and with absolute certainty, how your donation is making a difference in the real world.
With IGIVIT, we aim to create a completely integrated solution for giving better by providing financial assistance and/or emergency relief to the people and communities in need. We aim to restore trust in charities and bring philanthropy to the 21st century by building a decentralized application allowing donors to follow funds' usage and for charities to create and manage their campaigns with more transparency and accountability.
___
End-user value:
Once fully deployed, IGIVIT will help in more than one way:
- Bring back integrity, transparency and accountability into the donation process and;
- Become a leading donation platform in the philanthropic space; where charities and other organizations will be running all their campaigns on our solution.
We strongly believe that IGIVIT is a great use-case for the adoption of blockchain and its underlying Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). By being very easy to use and by giving the ability to witness, in real-time and with 100% certainty, how the donations are used, IGIVIT will be a great tool to demonstrate the true wonders of the technology.
In time, the general public will realize that blockchain-based organizations offer so much more than regular charities that the balance of donated wealth will start to shift.
What's more, IGIVIT will provide a thorough search engine that will allow you to find new charities to give to, even if they're not blockchain-based. For those latter ones, IGIVIT will automatically forward the donation to the charity's account (minus minuscule processing fees). If the organization is not showing in the search results, it can be added very easily by the user itself.
___
Usage:
Here are two examples of the main features the platform can be used for in order to improve the donation process:
Financial aid
- This is the most simple example. If the end-goal is to give money then the funds get transferred to the wallet of the person in need, for them to spend as they please. Every transaction is displayed transparently on the blockchain. There is no need for an auditor.
Emergency relief
- If the goal is, for example, to feed villagers, then every step of the process will be displayed on the blockchain. For this to be validated with great certainty and to avoid fraudulent claims, a 3rd party Auditor will need to assess and approve the various steps involved.
___
Challenges and Roadblocks:
Many challenges and roadblocks exist on our path to successfully reach our goal. Here's a brief description of some of them, in no particular order.
Challenge 1 - Fraudulent/Untruthful ledger entries or claims
To deliver funds to a person in need is relatively straightforward as we can easily verify the transfer of values on the blockchain as long as we have proof of their true identities (we are looking at implementing Atala Prism for this portion of the challenge).
However, when trying to deliver physical help in the field (building shelters, serving food, etc) it is much more difficult to prove that non-digital actions really took place. To overcome this challenge, we are implementing a multi-signature process where both the Organization's campaign manager and an independent Auditor need to confirm the truthfulness of the action item being forever written on the blockchain.
Challenge 2 - Partial Centralization
Some level of centralization will unfortunately need to be present in order for a charity to manage their own campaigns. But we believe that the transparency of the blockchain coupled with the aforementioned Auditor process, will bring enough accountability into the system for the general public to get a heightened sense of trust towards the whole process.
Challenge 3 - Large endeavour
Our project is not small. There is a lot that needs to be accomplished and it has lots of potential ramifications that we are not aware of. We are then taking it one baby step at a time. Building the house brick by brick instead of throwing a tarp over some branches. That's why we are splitting the work in distinct phases.
Challenge 4 - Reliance on sub-contracted dev teams
We want to be 100% transparent regarding our capabilities. Our core team is not made of pure coders. In order for us to succeed in creating this ambitious project, we sub-contracted a dedicated dev team that will enable us to demonstrate to the world the possibilities offered by IGIVIT.
Challenge 5 - Legal monetary issues (doing philanthropy in all regions of the world)
Right now, questions arise about the legality of using cryptocurrency to deliver humanitarian aid to any parts of the world. This challenge is currently being addressed within our team as an on-going research. The solution will emerge in a later phase of the project.
One thing is for sure, in order to secure the value of the donated money, the use of a stable coin is inevitable.
Challenge 6 - Identity proof
One major challenge is to get absolute proof of the identities of the people and organizations taking part in our ecosystem. As we mentioned before, in order to be able to trust that help is really being carried out to the right people, a decentralized identity system needs to be used. All parties involved are then becoming owners of their own information; their own identities. Again, Atala Prism is so far the best example of such a system that could potentially be integrated into IGIVIT once we deploy on the Cardano blockchain.
One added benefit is that, while providing humanitarian help, it also provides greater freedom and possibilities to the affected people and their local communities through identity ownership.
Challenge 7 - Adoption by organizations
Of course, some organizations might not want to open their books so wide and so transparently to the world. They might prefer to remain opaque in order to keep more money for other things than helping the needy. Our vision is that, over time, the donors to these charities will switch to IGIVIT for a better way of giving. The opaque organizations might find themselves forced to adopt blockchain in order to remain relevant.
Challenge 8 - Blockchain choice
Even though we will be building the PoC with backend logic only first in order to get a working prototype faster, meaning without any blockchain, inevitably we are going to migrate to the only blockchain worth building on: Cardano. Our legendary 3rd generation protocol is the perfect backbone for our entire system because it is built the right way; because it is built for centuries. But we are preaching to the choir…
Building our solution in two separate steps will create a layer of complexity to the process as we will need to find time and resources to do the switch. But we believe the advantages outweigh the drawbacks so that's why we are moving forward with this plan.
Challenge 9 - Competition
Right now, there are very few places to donate where blockchain is used to guarantee and show the usage of said funds. The biggest one being Binance Charity (https://www.binance.charity/) . Even though it is one of the biggest crypto exchange in the world, the reach of its campaigns and the thoroughness of what is available to monitor seems pretty limited and we believe this is where our solution will shine.
___
Conclusion:
With IGIVIT, members of the general public will finally be able to see with their own eyes how their money is really being used, what actions have been taken, who received the intended help, all in fine detail. This emerging blockchain technology will then be used to create real improvements for real people; real changes in the real world.
By tackling challenges of the 3rd sector (philanthropy) head-on, we believe that one day, IGIVIT will become the reference in money donations.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Using data from cardanoscan.io and using the Ethereum account code in Ledger Live as a reference should allow for Cardano to have full account support in Ledger Live for both ADA and tokens. This proposal includes support for Cardano in both the desktop and mobile versions of Ledger Live. This integration will not enable the purchase of ADA in the Ledger Live app.
 
I estimate that the completing the code would take approximately 2 months for both desktop and mobile, for 4 months total development time. The goal of this proposal is to have Cardano account support merged into Ledger Live within 6 months after being funded. The development will be done using public forks of the Ledger Live apps on my GitHub account (https://github.com/KazW) so that progress can be monitored by the community.
 
This will be built during my weekends, I'm willing to dedicate 16 hours per weekend to meet the goal of completing the integration within 4 months. This means I would spend a total of 256 hours of development time over those 4 months. At a cost of $50/hour this comes to $12,800, I have added a ~20% margin to this in order to address any potential changes that may be required to make the code acceptable to the Ledger Live team.
 
The primary risk with this proposal is that 2 pull requests would need to be accepted by the Ledger Live team, one for desktop support, and another for mobile. This is a risk since ultimately, the decision to accept the code into Ledger Live is left to a 3rd party and not one of the authors of this proposal. To mitigate this risk, I have added a margin to the budget to allow for the Ledger Live team to request code changes during the review process.

Description
There are a lot of content creators in meditative practices, but no place for them to land in the crypto ecosystem. They are mostly using apps such as Youtube and Instagram that are deeply unsatisfying for two main reasons :
No or very low revenue generated by the published content
No possibility to have a voice in the future of the service
On the other side, there are several highly successful projects based on paid subscriptions, yet they are also very centralized (very few teachers benefit from them), and their paywall model won't be attractive for the users in the Web 3.0 economy. We want to be the first ones to build a meditation project in crypto, and we need the support of the Cardano community to do it. We believe this will bring a whole new category of users to Cardano from the vast wellbeing sector.
 
Introducing the CARE token
The CARE token aims to be a general use token for people who share the values of the care philosophy, oriented toward health, inclusive well being and ecology. It will be created as a native token on Cardano, and its treasury will be managed by the community of holders in order to empower projects related with the care philosophy, the Dyana dapp being one of them.
 
User Experience
Dyana will be first experienced as a decentralized application for meditation practices. Teachers will be able to post their audio, videos and texts in order to propose exercises and knowledge to the participants.
Instead of a like button the interface displays a CARE button. Participants can use it to pool the amount of $CARE they choose in order to support the content creator, the system and the community and incentivize them to develop the related topic. They will also have the possibility to buy NFTs for more creative content.
 
Main sections of the Dapp :
- Home
latest contents published
Followed content creators
NFT art (music, photography, relaxing stories, graphic design)
 
- Meditations
Collections of still meditations.
Audio files with covers. Launches on click a full screen audio player.
 
- Movements
Collections of meditations in movement.
Videos with covers, launches on click a full screen video player.
 
- Retreats
Selling NFT tickets for retreats organized by the community
 
- Governance
Conviction voting on protocol evolution and natural health related funding

Further developments
(This elements are outside the scope of this proposal but are essential to display the wider picture of the project)
Our long term vision for Dyana is to create a decentralized application for natural health, including practices such as meditation, yoga, qigong, nutrition and modern science. The goal is to study their interactions with AI as well as human consensus, in order to propose the most efficient combinations to the participants, in accordance with their health needs. It will be governed by its community and designed to become more and more efficient over time. It will be a link between prevention and cure, a bridge between traditional therapies and modern science.
Dyana will be built on four pillars :
- a decentralized knowledge base for prevention and well being.
- a network of practitioners, teachers, and users participating in a shared body-mind application.
- a personal health record and prevention assistant.
- a confirmation system for natural therapies.
These elements will be gradually combined to create a treasure of knowledge, governed by its community.

The samurai connects ROI to non-monetary values, enabling investors to fund public goods which bring value to society rather than profit.",29,"Friday, 20 August 2021 11:52",Nikita Steel,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Nikita-Steel/3097738-48088,,,250000,Requested funds in USD,"

Abstract
 
The Samurai protocol enables markets to be built around goods where success is not determined by profit but other factors such as HDI, Pollution, Social Endorsement etc... The system tethers economic value to customised key performance indicators, specific to each market. In other words, normal people can fund projects where the success criteria are determined by the market they are investing within. If the project completes the success criteria within the given market, the investor will extract a profit upon his investment.
 
Markets are applications that are built on top of the Samurai Network, which anyone can build. Each Market creates an ecosystem for projects and investors to collaborate on. Each market designs its own success criteria and system of verifying progress. People who Invest inside a project (within a Market) receive a tokenized asset whose value is correlated to the performance of the project. As the project completes its success criteria, the dividend that the asset produces will increase and be of greater value. The dividend holds intrinsic value due to the economic design and engineering of the protocol.
 
This dynamic is enabled by the Samurai Network's native crypto assets: Blue Coin, Power tokens and Centia Coin. Blue Coin is a price stable asset which serves as the vehicle which capital flows in and out from different markets. Power tokens are unique assets produced by projects completing Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) within their respective markets. Power tokens can be thought of as digital mining equipment within the Samurai Network. The power rating of these tokens is directly proportional to the KPI's achieved by an individual project; projects that complete more KPI's will produce more powerful Power tokens and hence more valuable dividends for their investors. Centia Coin is the Network's naturally scarce crypto asset which is intrinsically valuable. It functions as the networks central store of value and profit token. To be entitled to the revenue from network, Centia holders stake their holdings together with Power tokens; Power tokens multiply the staking power of their holdings. Thus, an organic demand is created for stakers to purchase more powerful Power tokens and increase the yield on their staking power.
 
Thus, the Samurai Protocol offers an alternative solution to funding public goods other than governments, potentially solving the free-rider problem.

P.S. (Please Note that Power Tokens (in Concept deck) and Trust Tokens (in Whitepaper) are the same asset)
How Cardano could use Samurai for Catalyst:
Cardano will give away $4M in Fund 6. It will see a return on this investment indirectly through the growth of the network. Utilising Samurai a custom market could be built specifically for the Catalyst program with a specific set of milestones and success criteria that the progress of Catalyst projects is judged by. On this market the community could fund projects, independently and make a profit if they complete their objectives. The $4M fund could be utilised as a fiscal stimulus pool supporting the market and will function much the same way as it used now. I.E. Cardano stakers vote for which projects they want to fund. However, this pool will function more like an Investment Fund and organically grow in size over time generating an economic flywheel effect which will enable Catalyst to be a more sustainable and independent program in the long term, funding and incubating a much larger number of projects over time.
 
Customer Adoption Strategy:
 
Early Adopters:
The Early market for this technology will be Blockchain/Crypto Platforms which utilize grant programs to stimulate growth of their platform. Similar to the use case for Cardano Catalyst this technology could be used to stimulate growth on other crypto platforms. At this point the product will be more customised to specifications of each platform. There is a dual purpose for this initial approach one being the early revenue stream providing a safety net for Samurai and the second being the endorsement within the crypto community which will help as acquire the crypto trader/speculator group of users needed to capitalise on arbitrage and liquidity mining opportunities making the mechanics of Samurai work as designed and intended. This will be a great foothold for when our strategy becomes more focused on customers outside of crypto.
 
Crossing The Chasm:
To reach a larger audience outside of crypto we will launch a standalone dapp built on the Samurai Protocol. This dapp will be a Roblox but for the funding of public goods and social initiatives, where anyone can create markets around specific goods and each market will have investors and projects using it. This app will have a strict privacy policy and Quality Control to deliver a high quality and easy experience for the end users. The purpose of this Dapp is not to take over and centralise the funding of all public goods, but rather serve as a marketing strategy displaying the power of the base layer protocol. A Jack of all trades is a master of none, but in this case this is purposeful. The Dapp will be used a spearhead to generate word of mouth marketing across different social circles i.e. philanthropy, research, climate change. This will then encourage an opportunistic visionaries to build custom solutions, on the layer 1, around specific markets.
 
The Tornado:
Once enough useful and meaningful applications have been built for Samurai, validating its value we hope to shift our strategy towards supporting institutions and governments. Governments & institutions are usually extremely pragmatic customers which will only buy in when they see their friends and other institutions doing the same. Once they decide to make the shift, they are usually very loyal customers which will stay on for a long time. There are two limiting factors which would need to be addressed at this point for them to be customers:
1. Security: By this point the layer 1 protocol must be fully decentralised, so that when a gov or institution builds its custom solution they will have the full assurance that they are in control not some technology company looking for power (security of the protocol goes without saying)
2. Full Product Experience: Pragmatic customers usually invest only when there net of service providers built around a specific technology. Likewise we expect that institutions and governments will wait until companies like R3 begin offering support for Samurai.

This service has been built on discord since Discord opens up high possibilities for interaction. Currently, only Nami wallet is supported. Cardanocon is already a finished product and running! As Cardanocon proves his functionality in practice, the way is open to add more functions on top to evolve and increase its user base and utility.
 
Goal
Easy one-click applications, to replace currently complicated actions in user friendly user experience on top of already existing social media platforms to save time and effort. 
 
How it works
Get the Nami wallet extension https://namiwallet.io/
Connect your wallet once with Cardanocon
(Works via message signing which is only possible in Nami at this moment)
Use all the functionalities directly from discord
Example videos: https://cardanocon.io/features
 
Currently Cardanocon provides following easy to use features (1 click)
- P2P Transactions (invoice)
- P2P Trading (100% save without escrow services / middle man) 
- Prove ownership of specific assets
- Promote your pool and let people delegate directly
- Auto role synchronization with (policies, assets and stake pool delegators)
- Mint tokens (+ custom metadata) (no fees)
 
 
(tutorial and introducing videos can be seen on the website https://cardanocon.io/features )
 
Example (Payments with escrow services)
Before:
- copy paste addresses back and forth
- make sure you always have the correct address in the clipboard
- find the assets in the wallet first
- verify the policy of each asset
- Not every wallet supports multi asset transactions
- Check the TX confirmation manually
Now (with cardanocon):
- Invoice a user with amount / assets (get exactly what you request)
- Easy pay with one click
- All assets will be checked for their policies
- Discord update on TX confirmation 
 
Upcoming features
*Already working Safe P2P Trading/Escrow feature (https://cardanocon.io/features/escrow) + FEES for the server owner
- Enhanced P2P trading with smart contracts
- Integrate wallets which provides an extension connector (currently only Nami)
- (integrate mobile wallets when possible!)
 
What is the budget for?
Right now the backend runs on two raspberry PI's 4 and sometimes they run out of memory.
Upgrade the server infrastructure to make the service more scalable and stable as it grows. (1100$)
Better website + explanations + illustration designer (400$)
Upcoming development (SC, wallet integration) 3000$
The service just launched recently after the launch of Nami wallet and its growing. At this point, around 8% of all Nami users are connected with this service. The feedback was already great and I'm always looking forward to improvements.

FOURWORDS is a decentralised advertising and social exchange platform.  
Users create a profile using four words to describe what they have to provide to the community, and four words to describe what they seek from the community. This builds the algorithm that actively sends and receives matches based on your profile in relation to the profiles in the community. This profile once activated seeks matches without your involvement day and night, collecting matches for you to view when you wish to reducing the time actively spent searching. Once a match is created between two profiles a messaging platform is available for the two users to communicate with to create an exchange. Once an exchange is created it is recorded on the blockchain and can be viewed by all users by creating a search contract of the blockchain. The first four words chosen for both providing and seeking for each profile are free of charge. Users can change their words or add more words to their profile for a fee. Users are incentivised to create profiles by being rewarded a percentage of the fees required for these payments for changing and adding words.
The platform is built by the users who add words into the app based on their requirements, in any language there are characters for on their device. Geo tagging allows users to show their localised area or nominate a target area to give or receive. Profiles also contain links to social media for extended searching opportunities. This app can also be used for building communities as well as promoting goods and services. Creating a search can take less than 4 seconds and requires no active screen time lost to ""browsing through the millions of search results"". Wallet integration gives this platform the final touch with the ability to make payments within the application, without the 10% fee from a platform like eBay for instance.
 
FOURWORDS is effectively a search engine for people, by people, controlled by the community.
 
Key Points moving FOURWORDS

Only four words for what you seek and what you have to provide to the community are required to actively search the platform.
Once a profile is created it searches for you 24 hours a day, seven days a week bringing you matches for you to view based on your selected words.
Users add words to the application as they see fit, thus enabling the community to build the database in the language they choose.
Messaging can take place in either a private conversation between two users, or as a group discussion for the unique sequence of four words, thus creating micro communities within the platform.
Users can search the blockchain in conjunction with geo tagging to create data sets of matches in a target area for the words chosen, thus creating a heat map of activity over time and space.
Users can link their social media accounts to their FOURWORDS profile, thus enabling a greater level of integration and personification creating a decentralised social media platform.
FOURWORDS is kind of like a search engine for hashtags, only more focused and transparent.
FOURWORDS operates as an individual node on each phone removing the need for centralised servers and securing the network from censorship; ideally through a platform like World Mobile Token (WMT). 
FOURWORDS is the only platform that provides equal access to all of the data accumulated from the community through its blockchain. 

 
FOURWORDS thinking
Our goals are simple...

Build a team that resonates with the key principle of the project, ""make advertising available to everyone."" 
Create a feasibility study outlining the two halves of the project, Development and Adoption.
Create a working prototype and identify the best community to test it on.
Identify key areas for improvement through community feedback.

 
Our funding estimates for creating the feasibility study and initial prototype development come to $8000 for the first three months.
$2000 for the feasibility study
$5000 for the initial prototype development
$1000 to identify a community
 
Our timeline for objectives over the length of the project consists of two stages.
 
Development Stage
1 Month: Identify test community, begin initial prototype development and outline test objectives.
3 Months: Complete feasibility study and test initial prototype development.
 
Adoption / Funding Stage
6 Months: Launch prototype within test community.
9 Months: Test, adjust and begin finalisation of prototype with community collaboration.
12 Months: Complete review of the finished application and finalise survey of community feedback.
12 - 18 Months: Public launch concurrent with new testing community.
 
Given this timeline our expected public launch date would be in the third quarter of 2022

We will encourage part of the capital that is in Bitcoin to go to the Cardano ecosystem.",1,"Friday, 20 August 2021 03:00",Joseph Keller,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Joseph-Keller/3098981-48088,,,38625,Requested funds in USD,"

PROBLEM: Bitcoin is the only store of value that people know
Now the situation is like this,
Market capitalization:
Bitocon: $ 852 billion
Cardano: $ 67 billion
The general public sees Bitcoin as a store of value, and they only perceive it that way. Whoever has money in Bitcoin is not for anything else, only because there is a massive belief that Bitcoin will hold a certain price in the future.
Many will say that for reservation or transfer of value we can use ADA, and that's the way it is, in the same way that any other token can be used. The problem is that ADA is not perceived as digital gold, unlike Bitcoin which is. Although we know that there is no inconvenience to use it as such, people and institutions only recognize Bitcoin as hard money, this can be solved with this proposal.
There is a niche for a new digital gold to compete against Bitcoin, due to this it is necessary to create an alternative within the Cardano ecosystem that can do so.
 
SOLUTION: Create a Bitcoin substitute on Cardano
Maybe someone does it in some network other than Cardano, or maybe all networks do it after we do it, who knows?
We will face this question by creating a native token, minted in one go and without any kind of complication, this simple and effective question compromises the dominance that Bitcoin has around the world, possibly relegating it in second place.
Like a lollipop stick someone put there so kids wouldn't get their fingers dirty when eating candy, Hard Blue doesn't integrate vast complexity, but it does bring something with the potential to alter Bitcoin's place in favor of Cardano.
By now you can imagine some of the benefits this would have for future Hard Blue holders. Apart from all the improvements that Cardano can implement, if the security of Bitcoin is compromised, the user has another option where to diversify their capital, of course more transactions per second, a lower consumption and low commissions.
Not every Bitcoin holder has security or decentralization requirements such as Bitcoin offers, many may wish to safeguard value in another network that provides other characteristics. Competition gives people the opportunity to choose an alternative more appropriate to their interests, that is why there are people who open a bakery on the same street that there is already another, the most competitive of these businesses absorbs the customers of the most inefficient company forcing them to disappear, to diminish its influence or to become more competitive. This scenario is the one proposed by Hard Blue.
The monetary expansion diverted from fiat money by the governments of the world will be the cause of high inflation that will attract people and institutions to keep part or almost all of their capital in cryptocurrencies that have the characteristics of non-inflationary money such as Bitcoin or Hard Blue.
I propose the promotion of a digital gold to replace Bitcoin, a hard money called Hard Blue.
 
Phases
The project consists of 3 phases:
1 - Initial diffusion (for which we request funds; duration 90 days)
2 - Mass diffusion
3 - Consolidation
With the first phase we will get information on how to deploy the way to promote this proposal in the second phase, we will also be able to see the level of acceptance it has by the masses and an estimate of the percentage of people who are willing to change partially or all of their Bitcoin by Hard Blue. These questions may be presented as surveys in the same diffusion process.
We will consider this proposal a success if we perceive an acceptance from the public above 50%.
 
Conclusion
The project featured here is Hard Blue and we are requesting funding for an outreach campaign.
The funds required for a sufficiently relevant diffusion campaign to publicize Hard Blue on social networks and thus see its impact are detailed below:
- 90 days of Twitter advertising with a budget of $150 per day (90 days * $150 = $13,500)
- 90 days of advertising through Google Ads with a budget of $120 per day (90 days * $120 = $10,800)
- 90 days of advertising through Coinzilla with a budget of $120 per day (90 days * $120 = $10,800)
- 15 specific advertisements made every 6 days for 90 days through different advertising media with a promotion budget of $235 per day. (15 days * $235 = $3,525)
$13,500 + $10,800 + $10,800 + $3,525 = $38,625
$38,625 is what is necessary for the completion of phase 1.
You will have doubts as to why we omitted other equally relevant mediums of communication. The final intention of the advertising action is to finally cover most of the relevant media to publicize Hard Blue in a massive way, however these diffusion options will be integrated as the project is promoted in its phase 2.
I want to clarify that the funds assigned to Hard Blue will not be used at any time to pay salaries or remuneration to the team, absolutely all funds issued in Fund 6 will be used for advertising and promotion of the Hard Blue project, as detailed above.
I greatly appreciate the time you have spent reading this proposal.
A respectful greeting to the entire community.

We propose a protocol that incentivizes PC users to lend their idle processing power in exchange for a reward, the NOETH token.",51,"Friday, 20 August 2021 02:47",The Noether Protocol,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/The-Noether-Protocol/3098383-48088,,,30000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


1) Overview
Most casual PC users spend an average of 20% of their CPUs theoretical computing power. This is a result of the advancement of multicore, multithreading technology, where the bottlenecks in performance are mainly linked to the memory wall problem, not to the CPUs computing power. Many users have stalled and idle cores that play no role in their day-to-day work. A structural phenomenon that can be traced back to the CPU computing race, a race that has no reflection in the actual computing power spent by the general public.
But this computing power is an extremely valuable resource for the scientific community, and particularly to scientists who work in developing countries. CPUs and GPUs increasing prices have a major impact on developing countries, where most scientists' purchasing power is limited by weak currencies and poor economies. A fact that is magnified by the sky-rocketing prices of these products that cryptocurrency mining aggravates.
This scenario implies a constant wasted potential on idle processors that could be gathered and capitalized by the scientific communities of developing countries. We work as scientists in South America, and that's why we propose to address this phenomenon through a specific protocol based on a token that rewards PC users in exchange for their idle computing power: the NOETH token.
Inspired by the work of Emmy Noether, renowned mathematician, the NOETH token incentivizes PC users to volunteer their idle processing power. This power is harnessed by The Noether Protocol and assigned without any cost to members of scientific communities in developing countries in accordance with a rigorous distribution algorithm. This process is free for its scientific beneficiaries, but adds real life value to the NOETH token.
The decentralized wealth created by the users and beneficiaries of the Noether Protocol fuels this value and, consequently, the NOETH token price.
 
2) Our team
The team behind The Noether Protocol includes physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists and experts in cryptocurrencies, as well as lawyers and software developers, to ensure a safe and serious experience, akin to those who identify themselves with the Cardano Ecosystem and its core values.
All the legal and institutional information regarding The Noether Protocol will be public. It aims to be an open source project with maximal transparency.
There are many anonymous projects in the crypto space. Some of them are trustworthy and justified, as the blockchain is a secure technology that bypasses obsolete regulations and bureaucracy. We acknowledge the protection of anonymity as an important fourth generation human right, alongside rights such as the right to digital identity and digital reputation.
But it's undeniable that many so-called developers take advantage of this revolution to create ponzi schemes and scam new (and sometimes experienced) investors.
We understand the importance of accountability in endeavours such as this. In that spirit, the whole team behind the Noether Protocol will be public. 
 
3) How does it work?
In the first stage of the project, we aim to adapt the BOINC software to the crypto space. This software gathers CPU and GPU cycles on a computer to do scientific computing. It currently has over 5 million users. SETI@home, the project that analyzes radio signals to find signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, runs through BOINC.
We will build our protocol within the infrastructure of this proven open software. But there are key differences between most BOINC-based projects and The Noether Protocol.
In the first place, our protocol will offer a concrete reward, the NOETH token, that will encourage PC users to volunteer their processing power. And it will be easier to promote scientific projects on our platform due to its decentralized nature.
On the other hand, most projects built upon the BOINC open software originated in developed and rich countries, whose scientific communities do not have to face the same obstacles that scientists in third-world countries endure on a daily basis. This is a core feature in The Noether Protocol's identity.
In the second stage, we look forward to build from scratch our own infrastructure that achieves similar goals to those found in the BOINC software, but that -at the same time- is tailored to the specificities and idiosyncrasies of the crypto environment.
Finally, in the third stage of the project we expect to be able to fund a new and competitive cluster in South America exclusively dedicated to scientific communities of developing countries alongside their educational institutions and universities.
 
4) Why fund science in developing countries?
Most developing countries cannot afford significant scientific funding, for this is an area where results are not immediately shown. We live in countries where urgent matters tend to sideline fundamental necessities such as scientific research. This ends up causing a great asymmetry between the scientific talent of developing countries (mysteriously born in any remote corner of the world) and the resources available to take advantage of these exceptional professionals.
Many great scientists fail to fulfill their potential due to a lack of proper tools and resources. This is a real world problem. Let's remember that computing power is essential to scientific endeavors such as molecular biology, protein folding studies, oncological research, epidemiological simulations, etc.
If the blockchain applications become merely speculative projects without any real utility, we will be wasting this powerful technology. And we believe that science funding in developing countries is a project faithful to Cardano's core values: a serious ecosystem that aims to solve real problems, and not just a place of speculation.
 
5) Tokenomics
The NOETH token has all the advantages of any cryptocurrency: decentralization, security and a revolutionary technology in terms of value exchange and storage. It's also censorship resistant, and this is decisive in the scientific field.
Additionally, our project is dealing with pre-existing value: the wasted processing power of idle cores in PCs. Redistributing this asset is a source of value in and of itself. The PC users do not necessarily have to be involved in any scientific community in particular, for they will be rewarded anyway in exchange for their idle processors.
The NOETH token will be minted and awarded to users who volunteer their PC processing power. The reward will be related to the amount of processing power lended by the user, even if it's not actually demanded by a particular project at the moment.
The BOINC client will compute how many theoretical tasks the user is clearing and how much computing power is being volunteered to the grid, and will award such a user a proportional amount of NOETH.
The token is distributed in epochs, and the amount of tokens minted in each epoch depends on the quantity of lending users. The distribution is in accordance to a weighted average of the time each user lent its processing power and a metric that is defined upon the processing power itself.
You can see a more detailed explanation of the math behind our project tokenomics in the .pdf ""The math behind NOETH"" attached to this presentation. 
We cannot have a max supply, for once the last NOETH token is minted, there would be no incentive to sustain the grid. So, in order to protect the token's value, the quantity of tokens awarded will be controlled by a logarithmic-like function. That is: a function that grows without bounds, but its rate of growth tends to zero. The NOETH token will be deflationary, for this function will create not a theoretical max supply, but a practical one.
 
6) Why launch on Cardano?
Crypto's scene, nowadays, seems full of tokens and schemes trying to make a quick buck straight out of people's expectations. But in science there is no rush. Or rather, rush is counterproductive to the scientific task. And in a world dominated by speed, fuss and at times even irrationality, the value of Cardano's slow, conscientious and professional stride seems very important to us, first as investors and ADA holders, and today as developers of a dApp. 
The Noether Protocol is a project built by scientists, inspired by scientists and most importantly: for scientists. So what better chain than Cardano to bring it to life? Cardano is the only project that, since its conception, has always put trusted science above quick and unstable results. Is the project that for many years had to carry the burden of this serious and professional decision in the midst of scams and pump and dump strategies.
 
7) Timeline
3 months: we'll complete our current senior technical team with talented junior developers that share our enthusiasm with high performance computing and science. We'll also deploy our project on social media and reach out to scientific centers in South America (such as CONICET –Argentina-, Fiocruz –Brasil-, etc.) to present our project and establish a collaborative relationship.
9 months: we expect to have a working beta of our platform in the Cardano dApp's ecosystem with at least 4 scientific projects of developing countries -and particularly South America- employing the grid's computing power for research.
12 months: we expect to have finished the first stage of the project within the BOINC infrastructure, and start to build our own in accordance with the parameters referenced in section 3.

Request for Funding
We're seeking $70,000 that will be used to hire an IOHK Lead DevOps Engineer to lead in developing and implementing the necessary bridging to ADA of our staking network, treasury and yield protocols. This will in turn give us the proper foundation to facilitate our full integration of Cardano and any future Cardano based tokens, defi networks, or exchanges into the Connect Financial platform. This will allow us to provide a native ADA collateralized International Visa Credit Card, new more efficient yield farming vault strategies, and a broader range of tokens for swap or exchange.
Detailed Plan
Immediately source and hire an IOHK Lead Developer to lead in developing and implementing the necessary bridging to ADA of our staking network, treasury and yield protocols.
We're seeking 6 months in full-time salary wages for the candidate. Our goal would be to complete the bridging by the end of Q1 2022. Their employment will continue with the Connect Financial team as required after implementing the proposed tasks.
The goal is to become cross-chain interoperable with the Cardano ecosystem. We currently have 25,000,000 CNFI (ERC-20) tokens unlocked on the Ethereum Blockchain with a total supply of 108,500,000.
While the network effect of Ethereum cannot be understated, the cost of staking, transferring, swapping and redeeming staking rewards is far less than ideal. By migrating CNFI staking to Cardano and potentially unlocking new tokens on Cardano, the cost to perform the aforementioned functions will be greatly reduced.
Simultaneously this partnership will significantly expand the Cardano community's Defi functionality of ADA.
While many blockchain projects talk about the science behind their technology, none have done more to soundly construct a truly decentralized proof of stake blockchain than Cardano. Connect Financial knows that the Goguen smart contract platform release is imminent and intends to add great use and utility to it.
What follows are the basics of Connect Financial and how it works.
Members are offered IBAN (International Bank Account Number) and account funding is available via traditional SWIFT, SEPA, and Wire Transfers as well as by standard crypto methods. This is all managed and monitored through a detailed Client Portal.
Connect Financial provides its members with an International VISA Credit Card for daily use essentially world-wide.
Credit is allocated to each member based on the type and amount of collateral held in their Connect Financial Wallet.
Each user's credit limit is determined as a percentage of collateralized assets and NOT by a credit score.
Users can choose to pay their balance and interest using a variety of methods including Fiat transfers or Crypto.
Connect Financial offers 5 different credit card levels. Each type/tier offers a slightly different Credit Card and associated benefits.
Here is an overview:
Basic – No staking required, 1.5% fee Crypto to Fiat conversion, 11.40% APR on credit used, up to 6% yield APY on stable coins and fiat holdings.
Silver - 5000 CNFI staked, 1.30% Crypto to Fiat conversion fee, 10.90% APR on credit used, up to 8% yield APY on stable coins and fiat holdings.
Gold – 20,000 CNFI staked, 1% Crypto to Fiat conversion fee, 9.90% APR on credit used, up to 9% yield APY on stable coins and fiat holdings,
Platinum – 100,000 CNFI staked, .75% Crypto to Fiat conversion, 8.90% APR on credit used, up to 10% yield APY on stable coins and fiat holdings,
Black – 200,000 CNFI staked, .5% Crypto to Fiat conversion, 7.90% APR on credit used, up to 12% yield APY on stable coins and fiat holdings.
 
Proposal Impacts on Key Metrics
Cardano has one of the most loyal blockchain communities in crypto (which is evident by the high number of staked ADA (73%). Connect Financial intends to add to the Cardano community by facilitating ADA's expanding asset class with enhanced use and utility.
Connect Financial also has a very loyal following with over 57% of CNFI staked since launch on March 26, 2021. It is worth noting that currently the cost to redeem, stake and un-stake CNFI on Ethereum ranges between $40 and $300 USD depending on gas costs. This has left many Connect community members requesting alternative blockchain solutions.
Connect Financial customers are also looking to hold tokens or coins that we allow as collateralized assets, which are specifically vetted, and must conform to a strict list of requirements. (Strong volume, High Liquidity, Low Volatility, Strong Community, etc) ADA will become one of these collateralizable assets.
In Project Catalyst Fund 4 Dapps & Integrations: ""Cardano payments card"" was requested. Cardano payments card (ideascale.com). Connect Financial is here to answer this call by bridging the gap between the Legacy CeFi and Cardano DeFi space.
In Project Catalyst F4: There was a Fund 6 Challenge Setting ""Migrate Ethereum"" (ideascale.com) which was one of the top clapped proposals. Connect is also here to answer this call by being one of the first Eth based projects to migrate to Cardano.
 
Definition of Success
Successful and complete Bridging of Connect Financials Staking, Treasury and Yield Protocols to Cardano by the end of Q1, 2022.
Significant Adoption and use of Connect Financial products and services by the Cardano community while having the ability to use their ADA holdings as collateral.
 
In Conclusion
Although classified as an asset, Crypto holdings typically can't be leveraged the way other traditional assets can. Our core members have over 20 years experience each in our relevant field and have been preparing legal, compliance and network approvals required to bring our product to market since 2019. Our Client Portal and Credit Card products are set to begin shipping Q3 2021 along with the launch of our Treasury Protocol.
We are not merely a crypto-backed credit card. We are a place to buy, sell, borrow, lend, store, convert and swap crypto. We have positioned ourselves as a viable option for the under-marketed unbanked and for those ready to expand away from traditional corporate banking products and services.
The benefits of this integration to Cardano and the ADA Community are massive. It gives us the proper foundation to facilitate our full integration of Cardano and any future Cardano based tokens, defi networks, or exchanges into the Connect Financial platform.
This will allow us to provide a native ADA collateralized Visa Credit Card, new more efficient yield farming vault strategies, and a broader range of tokens for swap or exchange to ADA holders.

We aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.
Our business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.
This approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services

COST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.
MATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.
TRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?

We solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. 
Another great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.
The key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.
Founder bios
Gabe Gralla is a software engineer, data scientist, and technology leader based in Boston. He most recently served as Chief Information Officer at Zero, a non-profit building COVID safety apps. Before that, he was Director of Data Engineering at Lyte, an early engineer at Moat (acquired by Oracle), and an independent consultant with clients ranging from enterprise healthcare companies to crypto startups.
Sam Gralla is a physics professor at the University of Arizona known for his work on black holes. He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award and the IUPAP young scientist prize in General Relativity and Gravitation. He is an accomplished teacher and public speaker. Check out a popular public lecture he gave on gravitational waves (https://youtu.be/Dn33_ySzB-w).
(We are cousins.)
Technical approach
The web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.
Timeline
Development of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.
The definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.
The definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.
The definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!
Campaign suitability
Since our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal will support the development of our core DApp using Plutus, together with the needed integration into the centralized web app that sets up the smart contracts. We are requesting $15k for contracting work to augment our own efforts.
Why should Catalyst voters support this project?
While the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good ""geek out"" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.
We would also note some specific benefits to the Cardano community:

The money will go directly back to the community by hiring Plutus developers.
Plutus developers will eventually use the expert marketplace we create.
Our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common ""lack of developer buy-in"" criticism.
The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.

What is our goal?
Our goal is to provide crowdfunding for all. From a small business in Argentina to a 20-year-old in Africa who has a brilliant idea that can change the world. All of this is can be easily done, through the Cardano blockchain. Although technology is advancing exponentially, it is still difficult for businesses to connect with investors.
We will give businesses the platform in which they can create, manage and sell their tokens. Also small and big investors can browse through lots of innovating ideas and choose to invest whatever amount of money they choose by purchasing their tokens.
Who are we?
We are 2 young men from Argentina looking to leave a print on the world. After working on different projects regarding investments and cryptography, we decided we wanted to integrate the blockchain into our idea. Currently we are in our crowdfunding phase but we are excited to show the world the potential of Token Allies. The solutions we propose are focused on developing new and exciting technologies that one day will change the world.
How our platform works
We have two users:
- Businesses and Start ups: Will have an easy to use platform where they can mint their own tokens and later on sell them to investors.
-  Investors: will be able to browse through different business tokens from all countries.
 
Investors will buy business tokens with a USD stablecoin. Users will be able to deposit into our platform through different cryptocurrencies, but all tokens will be bought in a stable coin. In order to prevent wallet variations on investors and business fundings.
 
What market are we entering?
Business tokenization is still a new industry and is growing rapidly. As more businesses realize the value of blockchain technology, the demand on blockchain services is growing quickly. The more businesses are familiarizing with blockchain, the more they realize the value of asset tokenization
 
Our Roadmap
Q1 2021: Planification and execution of the Project
Q2 2021: Private Investing and Crowdfunding
Q3 2021: Expansion of the team and community
Q4 2021: Presale and Exchange listings
2022
Q1 2022: Full Release of the Platform
Q2 2022: Business/investor features
Q3 2022: Voting system and Staking
Q4 2022: New and Exciting features and services
 
Budget: Our goal with this is to have a minimum working product when we start our Presale on Q4
The amount requested would allow us to complete our team
- 15.000 will go to developer salaries till the platform is released (3-5 months)
- 5.000 will go to server costs, legal services and marketing 
 
Our Coin
Allie Coin (ALLI) is our native cryptocurrency, created on the Binance Smart Chain.Once smart contracts are working, we are migrating to Cardano, where all business tokens will be minted. We expect the migration of ALLI to take place near the end of 2021, before our platform is released. Users whIch hold ALLI will have several benefits on our platform, which include lower deposit and withdrawal fees, voting rights, staking and many features we will reveal soon.
We are having a presale on ALLI in Q4, while we work on making the first demos of our platform.
 
Road to Decentralization
Following the spirit of our industry and the Cardano blockchain, we intend on slowly developing into a more decentralized system where all holders of ALLI will have a vote on how we run our platform. At Token Allies we understand where our industry is going and we intend on leading the way into a decentralized future. This will be one of our long term goals for Token Allies
Voting rights
Users which hold ALLI will have a vote in what goes on Token Allies. At first we intend on having a controlled system on what businesses get to sell their tokens on our platform, but as our community grows we look forward to our community being an essential part of this system
 
What is on the horizon?
Right now we aim at delivering the best product to market, but what's after that? We see a future where Token Allies is a big name in the blockchain industry. At this time we aim at business tokenization, but we believe in a world where blockchain is a part of our lives and we want to live in that world. Tokenization is an incredible tool that is revolutionizing the world and we definitely will do our part to get there. In the future we look forward to expanding to new and exciting sectors in asset tokenization and provide real value to our users. If you have this vision, we would love for you to join us.

Planet Cardano
Currently there are no exciting usecases for cardano and NFTs. Sending NFTs or ADA from one account to another is pretty boring.
To give cardano an exciting usecase i plan to create a cardano backed mmorpg. Not just a cardgame but a real world where you could explore, collect armor and weapons and claim buildings. Now where is the link to cadano? Everything you own or claimed can be turned into an NFT and exchanged with others, which is also represented in the game.
I created a small teaser which pictures on possible setup: 
You can a interactive proof of concept here: http://world.cardano-tools.io:8888/ (just enter anyting as username/pw) but it is really just to get an imagination and be gentle it runs on a crappy HW
The whole thing is an ongoing process and will be updated frequently here are some of the plenty ideas i want to realize:
-> Appealing sprites and animations
-> Profession system
-> Multiple types of mobs
-> World bosses
-> Interesting Weapons and Armor
-> Tresures
-> Caves
-> Factions
-> Villages will be capturable by factions and will then send minions to surrounding villages
-> Fill areas with according objects (cemeteries with graves)
-> Fill buildings with random stuff like chairs and tables
-> Chat system
-> Generic quests
-> Scriptes Quests
...
Technical features
-> All items can be eternized in the cardano chain
-> Whole world based on OSM
-> Runs directly in browser, no loading time, perfect for casual gaming
-> Infinity possibilities to expand the game
-> Runs on mobile browsers
Where will the Funds go
-> Pay bills while working on the game
-> Pay employees
-> Pay Artists to create pretty sprites, effects and sounds
-> Run the infrastructure
 
Lets make a playable first version for about 70k, should be ready in about six month.

This proposal is an updated proposal from fund 5 - several responses to questions raised by the community advisors are included at the bottom of this submission. #thankyouADAcommunity for your feedback and for voting our privacy rights ledger first place in fund 5 metadata challenge! (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088)
***********************************************************************************************************************
""From data abuse to personal data control and direct compensation"" – implementing and developing on top of the Cardano blockchain a smart contract system that (i) gives people back control over their personal information and (2) compensates them for the use of their data and for their attention.
Before going into our detailed proposal, we included a short summary on the (i) team, (ii) the cardano adoption in the next 3/6 months; (iii) a summary of our existing product in which we will insert the POC under this fund, (iv) a short explanation of this proposal, and (v) what 3-6-12 months success looks like.
Team – We have a versatile team with experience in blockchain projects that is able and committed to tackle this challenge within the budget proposed.
Michiel Van Roey – tech and privacy lawyer https://www.linkedin.com/in/michielvanroey/
Rajasekaran Yogarajah – senior developer (in plutus pioneer program) https://www.linkedin.com/in/life-artist/
Luke Bragg – product architect - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasbragg/
Ipek Sahiner – senior engineer in tech industry https://www.linkedin.com/in/ipeksahinerschlecht/
Shawn Jensen https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnj/ 
Cardano adoption and impact in the next 6 months - We already have a finished mobile application (2Y in development) to integrate this fund 6 proof of concept in, and are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected by Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6). 
Short summary of the Profila app (as testing ground for the smart contract POC) - Profila is a platform (mobile IOS/Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call ""Brands"") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance.
People can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire (centralized) tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do (in fiat). (see ""Illustration 1). However, its a centralized tool where Profila as commercial company needs to guarantee what data was shared, and where payouts in fiat take time, have large transaction fees, and are only done 1x/month in bulk. 
Big picture explanation of the current proposal. Building further on the existing data sharing functionalities in the Profila App (step 2 above), we will develop a proof-of-concept smart contract system that saves all relevant information you as an individual shared with a company onto the Cardano blockchain (in encrypted form), in exchange for instant payment in ADA. If a company (mis)uses your info in breach of this (smart) contract, you will be able to use your private key to access this info yourself (without Profila's involvement), and hold a brand accountable for breaching the agreement. This way you control the narrative, you control the relationship with a brand, and their use of your data. 
Success after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be the developed POC for this smart contract. Success after 6 months would be the integration of this smart contract POC into our existing app and first test with our existing customer. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of the POC, used for each data subscription. 
***********************************************************************************************************************
Now let's move on to our actual (detailed) proposal (!):
1. The market explained - the current privacy problem
People interact with digital services and purchase products from Brands globally. With each interaction you directly share personal data which is used for a certain purpose (e.g. offering you a product and servicing you as a customer). You agree to share your personal data – in most cases – without knowing how a Brand will use it.
In principle, each time your personal data is collected or used by a brand, you are shown a privacy policy or cookie policy you are forced to accept. Thereby, you agree to share your personal data, without knowing how recipients will use it. These legal documents are impossible to understand.
But what can you do if Brands uses your data against your expectations, and how do you keep track of all these legal terms that governs Brands' use of your personal data?
For example: you made an online Wholefoods-account to order groceries but you now get 15 newsletters/week, and your social media feed is full of adds from companies like Trader Joe's, to who you never shared your personal data. You have no idea what you agreed to in a privacy policy with Wholefoods, and you do not know why similar companies are contacting you for products you bought from Wholefoods.
Today, you have no control over the use of your personal data. It is entirely the Brand that decides (i) when to contact you (+frequency), (ii) via which channel, and (iii) the content you receive. However, people demand more control over their personal data and are willing to take action to gain back ownership of their digital lives, but the resources to put that in motion are lacking.
That is where Profila steps in!
2. Profila today - the existing consumer App – first step towards data control and compensation
""We must work together with web companies to strike a balance that puts a fair level of data control back in the hands of people, including the development of new technology … and exploring alternative revenue models like subscriptions and micropayments"" (Tim Berners-Lee, developer of the worldwide web @ CERN).
If you know how to control your data and take action against those who (mis)use it, you can demand the value that is derived from it by asking compensation.
An important step in order to get to data control, is keeping track of your personal data and who has access to it. This is taken care of by Profila's data subscriptions. Profila's data subscription contract functionality allows for people to keep track of all the Brands that access and collect your personal data; and ultimately receive a compensation from Brands that subscribe to your data.
Via Profila's web-based Brand dashboard, a Brand can send a ""subscription offer"" to their existing customers or potential new customers, in which the Brand can detail which of your personal information in your Profila App (one source of truth with your contact details, communication-, product preferences) they ask access to, and in which they propose to you some key contractual terms in relation to your interaction; a.o. (1) the specific data they require, (2) the duration you grant access; (3) the purpose for which the Brand wants to use it; and (4) the compensation you receive in exchange.
Our process makes sure the Brand explains the contract terms in understandable language, so the consumer knows what he/she agrees to. Our revenue model is 50/50, meaning that every USD that a Brand pays for accessing your personal data (and showing you its products/services), we share 50/50 with consumers.(Please see the illustrations 2 ""Smart contract visual"" and 3 ""Subscription payment visual"").
If you do not agree to these terms, you remain anonymous and the Brand will never see your personal data. If you do agree to these terms, you essentially click ""accept"" and both parties conclude a data subscription contract. Payment is made by the brand at intervals throughout the contract terms (usually monthly), on the conditions that the consumers' personal data is kept up to data, and the brand can also access additional data about the consumer's preferences for certain products and services relevant for the brand.
E.g. Wholefoods pays Alice 12 USD/year (1 USD each month) to access her (i) personal data (email, phone) (ii) preferences about food (vegetarian, bio-products, lactose intolerant) and (iii) communication preferences (Alice would like to receive discounts/product info via WhatsApp). This helps to serve her better. If Wholefoods listens to Alice, she will be a happy consumer. Alice gets good products and services and receives a compensation for the use of her personal data by Wholefoods. Each advertisement she watches from the Brand in Profila, Alice gets paid. If Alice wants to know in the future what she agreed to, she can easily verify the terms of her relationship with Wholefoods in her Profila App (under the Wholefoods data subscription). If Alice want's the relationship to stop, she can end the contract and exercise her ""right to be forgotten"" (via the privacy rights functionality in the Profila App, see our metadata challenge submission in the first sentence of this proposal), so that Wholefoods is legally required to delete her personal data.
Conclusion: these subscriptions help brands with their privacy compliance + get to know you better; and these subscriptions help you control your data, get compensation, and receive only those messages from brands you care about, via the channel of your choice.
3. Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - implementing data subscription contracts on the Cardano blockchain in the form of a smart contract, and using ADA for micropayments
What do we seek to improve via this Challenge?
Issue 1 - ""centralized contract management"" – each data subscription contract (including the specific terms) that is concluded between an individual Profila user and a Brand today, is only saved/stored by Profila in our IT environment and can only be enforced by Profila or its existence proven by Profila. Profila as a commercial entity is therefore guaranteeing that a data subscription exists, what terms it contains, whether terms are abided by (e.g. payments made or request received).
Profila needs to monitor if money is paid by the Brand, and if personal data and other commercial data by the individuals is filled in/updated. This is a liability for both contracting parties, who would need to trust Profila.
Profila, as a commercial company, would have to actively step in as arbitrator/mediator, and guarantee this level of trust that a transaction took place/contract was concluded + terms thereof. However, we only want to provide consumers with the tools to control their data. The trust and consensus that a transaction took place or contract was made needs to come from the community of users.
Issue 2 - ""low-value; high volume payments"" - The data license fee and any other fees for attention to be paid to users are currently setup using Stripe, which is not ideal for sending very low-amount, high-volume instant payments worldwide. 
What is Mitsubishi, as a Japanese brand, needs to pay a US consumer on Profila for a data subscription (let's assume 2.4 EUR per company per year, paid on a monthly basis)? We would have to bill Mitsubishi 0.20 USD for the monthly subscription and transfer our US customer 0,10 USD (50% of the revenue). This takes time, administration, and will include large payment processing fees (compared to the amount transferred). Considering the number of customers of the Profila App (25.000 expected in 2021; 78.200 expected in 2022), payout models like Stripe are too expensive and do not scale. We have setup monthly payouts to consumers (in bulk, for several activities with several brands combined) to reduce costs of transferring money, but we would want to be able to instantly pay a consumer without many transaction fees.
What do we seek to create in the POC under this Challenge?
Under the Catalyst project fund 6, we want to tackle these 2 issues by including smart contracts (which executes themselves and don't require Profila as intermediary monitoring entity) and paying the compensation out via ADA.
First, we will include the relevant elements of a data subscription in an immutable (Cardano) blockchain ledger. The POC will show on the ledger all contracts you concluded with different Brands, showing every authorization or consent you gave to each company for the use of your (personal) data.
Nobody would be able to tamper with this information. If a company misuses your data, you can make them accountable by referring to the ledger entry. You can even use the information in the blockchain to file a complaint at a national data protection authority, showing them what you agreed to, and how the company actually (mis)used your data. This is control.
IMPORTANT - We do not put the actual personal data on a public ledger, but only an identifier of each participant (hashed/deidentified) and the actual terms of the contract (e.g. Parties= YT132 and ZW345; Shared information= email; Period= 3 months; Payment= 1EUR etc). This entry provides proof the ""EVENT OCCURED"" but doesn't show the actual people involved nor personal data shared. When either of these 2 parties wants to proof this in the future, they have the underlying information (private keys / certificates) to show the actual data that was exchanged. If third parties need access (e.g. privacy authority or courts), then the ledger provides proof of the event, and the parties can then share the actual documents that were exchanged. The public blockchain however will never hold the personal data.
Second, we want to integrate cryptocurrency payments using ADA, so that people can receive instant micropayments for their personal data and attention if the terms of the smart contract remain fulfilled.
What other challenges are ahead in our ""Zero-knowledge advertising & insights"" development roadmap?
This smart-contract project is only the first step into our broader Cardano technology adoption and integration around zero-knowledge advertising and insights, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. Under the next funds, we want to submit additional project proposals for important features we want to develop as part of this effort:
- step 1 - personal data license smart contract - this is part of the present submission.
- step 2 - privacy ledger – This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform. UPDATE - We have submitted this proposal under the ""metadata challenge"" of FUND 5 and received the first place! #thankyouADAcommunity. See here for our proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088. We will keep you posted on our progress.
- Step 3 - digital ID (for FUND 6) - Atala implementation – If you want to control your data online and receive (financial) compensation for your data, it is important you can provide proof of your identity. Atala Prism is the perfect solution. By integrating Atala, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments. We are sending in a submission in FUND 6 challenge ""Atala PRISM DID Mass-Scale Adoption"", https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26116
- step 4 (for FUND 7 or later) - zero-knowledge proofs - personalized ads with respect of privacy - using zero-knowledge proofs in order to allow a brand to advertise to the ""perfect"" consumer (meaning to the exact target audience consumer, which exactly matches the specific offering/message a brand wants to share), without sharing ANY personal data with the brand. Stay tuned for more information!
4. Practical aspects – ""show us the money"" – costs
Via this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our data subscription POC. Creating a first proof of concept (POC) of a data subscription on the Cardano blockchain, will require at least a budget of 46.850 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:
- 20 days of senior blockchain developer @ 900 USD per day – totaling 18.000 USD
- 25 days of web/backend developer @ 400 USD per day – totaling +/- 10.000 USD
- 25 days of app developer @ 400 USD per hour – totaling +/- 10.000 USD
- 9 days of legal work (draft contracting language + verify privacy concerns with data on blockchain) @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 8.850 USD
We are currently already preparing for the development of this solution – which we are trying to pre-finance – because we believe this is a very important functionality in the control of your data. We expect the solution to be ready by the end of Q4 2021, so that we can test it with the companies that are now using the Profila app with their consumers.
Who will be the senior blockchain developer? We are currently in communication with IOHK's professional services department (option 1) and are ""seeking"" in parallel a blockchain developer in the Catalyst community (=those who are interested, please contact myself or Shawn).
5. Practical aspects – ""getting on the road"" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer
At the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 6, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.
(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila.
We have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021 (Q1 2022). According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 by the end of 2022 (by adding more brands).
(2) Geographical focus market? We are launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q3 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).
(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy ""Millennials"" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old) that are ware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it; and ""brand-loyalists"" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).
(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.
(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end of 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).
(6) Brand adoption of our solution. Why would brands change their current data use model? The strategy many companies adopted for a while now is big data collection and full use of their data as they please. However, there are many reasons why the tides are changing and a model such as ours will (have to be) be adopted by brands. Just to highlight a few:
- inaccurate data - research shows that many brands hold inaccurate and outdated data, which doesn't help brands serve their customers well but on the contrary poses a bigger risk for data leaks / privacy breaches. CRM systems need accurate personal data, which can only be kept up to data by (and with the consent of) the individual.
- pressure of regulation - recent privacy laws adopted over the entire world (GDPR in Europe, CCPA in USA, LGDP in Brazil, POPPI in SA etc) are making it impossible for brands to continue their existing data collecting practices. Data subjects rights, transparency requirements, data minimization obligations all push brands into our direction.
- promising feedback and testing - The MOST important reason why we believe in our model is our conversations with big brands over the last 4 years. The third slide in our PPT deck attached to this proposal shows a few of these brands that we spoke to. in short: Brands seem to get it. They get it that their data is inaccurate, that they don't really know what their consumers want and how to approach them most effectively; they get it that the new model requires an interaction with their customers. We are now setting up trials with several brands and are confident the (test) data will show that by listening to consumers, they will get a better understanding of how to treat their loyal customers better.
6. Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)
As an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:
First, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.
Second, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.
In addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.
Finally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess (and take feedback) on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.
7. Defining success
The POC we will develop under this Catalyst fund 6 submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to provide people with control of their data and compensation for their attention. Success of the POC would be that we can integrate it into our existing App with one of the 5 SME brands that are testing, and make sure it works with their consumers, and their consumers can get paid via an integrated or linked ADA wallet.
8. Responses to some concerns by the CA's under FUND 5
We want to end our proposal by thanking the community (advisors) for their numerous great feedbacks during the review phase of our proposal under Fund 4, where we submitted this first step in our ""zero knowledge advertising and insights"" project called ""Dapp to control and monetize your data"". https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/341501-48088.
We are very grateful and humbled by score and feedback we received from the reviewers, who showed they read our proposal in detail and who provided valuable feedback. #thankyouADAcommunity
We wanted to briefly respond to some open questions of those who made some reservations, and have included the advisor's questions as well as our responses in the PDF attached called ""CA concerns and Profila remarks"".

Summary
https://www.cornucopias.io
Cornucopias 'The Island' is a blockchain based play-to-earn, build-to-earn, and learn-to-earn, stake-to-earn MMORPG game where players can own land and other NFT (non-fungible tokens) based assets that have real-world value, all hosted in a fun and expanding metaverse (a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users). It was inspired from Charles Hoskinson's video - ""The Island, The Ocean and the Pond"".
 'The Island' is split into a number of themed zones such as the 'Wild⋆West' zone, 'Farm Life' zone and 'Age of The Samurai' zone, where people of all ages can play a series of mini-games, getting lost in the play-to-earn ecosystem where they can earn real-world value as they explore and build in our safe and secure world.
The more creative players can design their own items such as coffee tables, beds and other household furnishings which can then be minted into an 'Island Blueprint' that other players can then buy, gather the materials, and then craft in-game into a brand new NFT. Once created, the crafter can play with the items in their virtual dwelling or sell them onto other players to enjoy or sell on again.
'The Island' combines gaming with real-world commerce and gives opportunities for traditional and ecommerce companies to sell and promote their real-world brands, goods and services, to a hard to reach audience they have potentially never had access to before.
Available worldwide, 'The Island' is built on the Unreal Engine 5 games engine which is compatible with the PC, mobile phone, games consoles and smart TV's, and will be powered, governed and be forever evolving thanks to a growing number of communities including blockchain, Unreal game developers, Voxel, 3D artists and modelers and general game enthusiasts.
Creators and players will discover a new form of currency economics where they can create and trade their own NFT's in-game or on 3rd party marketplaces, and no longer will their purchased game assets be trapped inside a single game again.
A disruptive gaming revolution is upon us and Cornucopias 'The Island' awaits everyone to come and join in the fun of changing gaming forever!
Cardano Background
As a member of the Original 50 Cardano Project Catalyst I have been active in the community and have been working on the Cardano network for over a year - I have successfully delivered a project in Fund 3 https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Smart-Contract-Plugin/333827-48088 and I am working on a project for Fund 4.
Knowing the eco-system and community so well I formed a new company in January 2021 dedicated to writing a blockchain game on Cardano. Self-funded with 4 other Cardano pioneers to date we have been busy planning the game, building the team and putting together the Whitepaper and a series of demos to show the community how the game may work.
Cornucopias 'The Island' Game could not have been possible without Project Catalyst introducing me to Cardano however to date it has all been bootstrapped and has had no Catalyst funding.
I want to continue to build Open Source software for the community to use alongside building the game, and if this project is successfully funded I will produce the following using members of the Plutus Pioneer courses to both help my project and to help others in the community to put their new skills to work.
'The Island' is powered by NFT's as players build upon and own the land, characters items and real estate. The game will allow community members to own their own NFT shop and allow them to sell their NFT's.
I therefore need Smart Contracts to help many transactions occur.
The first open source project I need Smart Contracts for is an NFT Auction House. This will be a key feature to help community members to auction their NFT's and in addition to the software will be usable away from The Island to help others grow their own software companies.
Why gaming on Cardano?
There are so many reasons to build an NFT game on Cardano, don't look at the network in August 2021 look where it will be in August 2022. We will have:
- lots of DeFi applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.
- lots of NFT applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.
- lots of Plutus developers we can offer full time jobs.
- Atala Prism will allow us to verify players age which is really important to parts of the game and something no other Blockchain can offer.
- Hydra will offer 1 million transactions per second.
- scalability and reliability is critical for a game that is aiming to attract 1m+ players.
 
What does success look like?
Success will be judged on the games popularity and to date we are growing a very good reputation on social media and a lot of positive 'buzz' is happening around the game.
We are looking at bringing over 1 million gamers to the Cardano Network within the first 3 years of launch and are looking to recruit many people from inside the Cardano community.
The Play-to-Earn and Build-To-Earn features of the game will bring prosperity to gamers like never before and has the chance to change lives in many countries.
We have recently teamed up with an Education Centre that holds virtual lessons in Africa and the Learn-To-Earn aspect of the game will help that eco-system grow further.
Stake-To-Earn aims to simplify staking and yield farming using a gamification style interface.
Success will also come in the form of recognition that Cardano is an amazing platform to build NFT Gaming on.
What does the current team look like?
I have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I started building the game alongside my full-time job in January and in July I went full-time working on the game - a huge leap of faith as I have no means of making an income until the game launches. Currently there are 9 members of the team.

A smart contract that implements a financial Trust on the Cardano Network that delegates and distributes your tokens as you describe.",13,"Thursday, 19 August 2021 18:00",RBM.dev,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/RBM-dev/3056495-48088,,,25000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Why a Community-led Trust?
Trusts are a core part of wealth management. Such a building block should be created, audited, managed, and trusted by the community. Any profits generated should be returned to the Treasury to be redistributed to fund future projects
Who am I?
I am an experienced Software Engineer and technical leader with a Masters in Computer Science who has been a member of the Crypto community since 2016 as an Ethereum miner. Upon seeing IOHK's Cardano Whiteboard Youtube video in 2017, I immediately believed in the vision and shifted entirely to the Cardano community and have been an Ada holder ever since.
As a software engineer and open source enthusiast, I have been anxiously waiting for the Plutus release to put my skills to use within the community. I recently participated in the first cohort of the Plutus Pioneer program in preparation.
Why am I asking for funding to create this?
I have recently left employment as Director of Engineering for a medium-sized enterprise Saas to pursue contributing to the Cardano community full time. For this to be a viable long-term career change, I need to cover my costs. These kinds of core reusable smart-contract building blocks seem like an ideal Catalyst-funded project and the perfect way for me to bring value to the community.
Budget
I have increased the initially requested funds from $15,000 to $25,000.
This is to fund six months of development with monthly expenses broken down as follows:

80 hours Developer time @ $37.5/hour
Servers and Infrastructure costs @ $500
5 hours Designer time @ $40/hour
Marketing and Promotion @ $250/month

Total Monthly Expenditure: $3950.00
Total Budgeted Project Expenditure: $23,700
Contingency Budget: $1,300
Success Criteria

The ability to send Ada to the trust contract to create a new trust that behaves according to the rules you have defined upon initiation
The contract should stake your Ada if desired while it is within the trust, with the staking rewards are returned to the trust.
The trust should be able to fund itself in a continuing fashion via a small trust management fee (0.01%/Month is my gut feeling but open to suggestions)
The management fee proceeds are returned to either the Project Catalyst fund or Cardano treasury.
All code open-sourced under a permissive license (TBD)
The project was built in public, including live-streamed coding sessions and office hours to discuss the direction.

Future Work

Support tokens besides Ada
Support the automatic creation and distribution of beneficiary wallets
Research the potential to include the purchase and shipping of a hardware wallet to the beneficiary of the trust upon trust initiation
Utilize oracles to support certain kinds of escrow use cases

How this proposal would impact the challenge metrics
When funded, this proposal creates a core building block for the ecosystem. Developers will utilize this Dapp defined trust instrument as part of many other DApps. The developer burden is reduced, and developer productivity increased while increasing the community's trust in their particular product. This will result in increased application output and transactions.
How this proposal addresses the challenge questions
What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?
In Centralized Finance:
""a trust is a fiduciary relationship in which one party, known as a trustor, gives another party, the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary.""
A Defi Trust instrument is a key application that can underpin the application ecosystem across platforms.
What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?
A Trust allows you to control your wealth, protect your legacy as well as protect your privacy. By delegating the fiduciary responsibilities of trust to the blockchain, a trustee can retain complete privacy and make considerable savings compared to engaging a traditional centralized trust entity.
What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?
A Trust is a relatively straightforward financial instrument used repeatedly and often by traditional financial product consumers looking to protect their wealth and legacy. As a result of its simplicity, it is an excellent candidate to be community-driven and maintained.

Our core values are integrity, excellence and teamwork. We are consisted of diverse individuals with different skill sets which we leverage to the best of our abilities.
What is Blockademia?
Rising number of false academic and professional credentials is an issue that hurts not only the academic community, but a wider economy as well. Dozens of government employees were discovered to have falsified diplomas and certificates in the last few years in the Republic of Croatia alone. Illegal businesses issuing false documents are thriving and the consequences are serious.
https://theconversation.com/fake-qualifications-are-on-the-rise-how-universities-can-manage-the-risk-109962+
Blockademia is a system that will enable institutions to issue diplomas and/or other certificates to their students. Students will get an immutable proof of their academic merit accessible through Cardano anywhere, anytime. Institutions will reduce their costs of issuing certificates and will also have access to the historical data they issued as well.
According to recent official data, we recognize a significant amount of academic or higher education institutions we can partner with:

Adriatic Region - cca 450
European Union - cca 2725
Worldwide - over 25.000

Furthermore, it is expected that by the year 2023, close to 300 million people globally will hold an academic or higher education diploma or certificate.
We are a well-positioned professional team with existing connections in the academic community in the region. We have an existing off-chain solution for verifying credentials for our academic and corporate clients.
Blockademia will be self-sustainable through the implementation of ACI utility token. Institutions will need to hold a certain amount of ACI tokens in an escrow account to enable creation of new certificates. Blockademia system will leverage smart contract functionality by developing a set of open-source smart contracts to be used by institutions and any other future participants. Blockademia system will be looking forward to incorporate Atala Prism in line with the vision of IOG and the rest of the market as soon as it will be available for public use. The company Smart Contract d.o.o. will coordinate the ACI token offering and will govern the Blockademia system until complete decentralization of the system. Decentralized governance will be achieved through ownership of the ACI token and decentralized identity.
To show our dedication for the project, we are investing our personal funds and time for the web front-end development and we plan to have it ready by the time the Fund 6 finishes. We will also cover the initial costs of marketing and promotion, as well as tokenomics and whitepaper development.
Inital version of our whitepaper is out, check it out in attachments!
COST BREAKDOWN:

Web development (back end software development and design) - $5.000
Web development (registration form and loyalty program for token presale) - $10.000
Web development (referral system & KYC) - $14.000
Marketing (SEO, social media, PR & review incentives) - $11.000

Total - $40.000
Social responsibility/charity
At the end of each business year, company Smart Contract will direct a part of its financial flow towards socially sensitive groups and especially children – to help ensure higher quality of education and personal development for everyone. The same practice will be done in countries and territories where Representatives will operate.

QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY:
Can you expand on your Business model more. How will the business be commercially viable? Where will it get revenue from and what is the breakeven from ongoing operating expenses for the business to turn a profit?
We, as a company, will offer access to a web and a mobile application. There will be 4 different levels of access to the system: Single user, Multi user, Professional and Enterprise. Each user level will have to lock a certain amount of ACI tokens (native token for Blockademia) to get access to their system level. Single user will need X amount of ACI tokens and will be able to issue X certificates per year through our system. Professional user will need 10X amount of tokens and will be able to issue 10X certificates a year, will be able to register several users to the platform and will have access to both web and mobile app. Each certificate issued will cost an additional amount in ACI tokens - part of that fee will be paid to Blockademia and part will go to the treasury. Additionally, we will offer a referral program where referrers will earn a part of the fee and finally we will offer a franchise model to our partners who will earn a part of the fee for their efforts. We will be publishing our white paper soon where all the details and exact numbers will be included, so please stay tuned for that.
What is your go to market strategy? How will you get universities to buy the product and incorporate it into their enterprise systems?
We did our market research and in conversations with potential clients we notice a necessity for this kind of a system. A lot of institutions use basic Excel sheets or databases which are manually edited, prone to human error and administratively expensive and inefficient. There is definitely a market need, but also a real will from institutions to adopt Blockademia. On the other hand, we plan to distribute ACI tokens to market as quickly and as efficiently as we can. We plan to execute private and public sales rounds and reserve a certain amount of tokens to onboard institutions to our system.
What is going to top stop universities from just building their own based on funding some PHD students thesis?
Great question! I would say, basically nothing. If that's the way they want to go, of course they can. And in a certain amount of time, we plan to open-source our system and release the governance into the hands of the DAO. The difficult part is building the system, testing it out, making it work, onboarding the users and creating trust in the system. We are of the opinion that it is much simpler and cheaper for institutions to just use our system since it will be a ready commercial product instead of building their own. Also. any institution will have an option of becoming a franchise owner if they want to use the system for earning tokens.
First, yes this is an issue but you are not the only one fighting this. As you are mentioning lots of numbers, there are also many parties preventing a large size of what you are showing.
We are not claiming we are the only ones tackling this issue. Actually, we have contacted the Deqree team from India who had a very similar proposal in Fund 5 and we are thinking of ways to collaborate. We are aware there are existing systems for verification, of course. Our system, compared to those, will be significantly cheaper, actually free of charge for small users that want to verify up to 25 documents per year. Also, using Cardano gives permanence and immutability and the verifiers will not depend on the institution itself to verify the document.
Second. If a qualification is real but fraudulent this means that a person high up the tree at universities have assigned that person the degree. So how can you stop this with Blockademia?
This is a very good question and such an important part of the whole story. Initially, we will be onboarding institutions which have high reputation in Croatia, institutions without affairs involving forgery and with significant numbers of students over a long period of time. We will do due dilligence about all of the institutions that are onboarded to the system. Long term, an incentivized governance structure between institutions themselves will be set up. But still, this is one of the difficult points and we are looking forward to discovering solutions, discussing with institutions and the community about it.
Third. The funding is very strange. First you require 6k for backend development and design and then you need another addition web development funding. Isn't this supposed to be a decentralized application?
So this is our cost breakdown:
Web development (back end software development and design) - $5.000
Web development (registration form and loyalty program for token presale) - $10.000
Web development (referral system & KYC) - $14.000
Back end SW development and design consists of creating software that writes data to the blockchain and its testing and it costs $5.000.
Web development (registration form and loyalty program for token presale) - we need to create, publish, save and orchestrate a registration form for people to register and we will have incentives for spreading the network. This costs $10.000
Web development (referral system & KYC) - we need to develop and integrate a KYC system and software that saves referrers and connects them to people they referred. This costs $14.000
It will be a decentralized application, but the development of any application (centralized or decentralized) has initial costs for development, testing and deployment.
Where does there needs to be a referral system be implemented when you list all the things you want to tackle?
The referral system is there to incentivize onboarding new users to the Blockademia application to achieve high as possible decentralization. We just updated our proposal today with the initial version of our whitepaper, the details of the referral system are included there.
How do you need 11k for web development to setup the token sale? Why do you need the token sale in the first place, you haven't mentioned anything about it. Just that you need the funds for it.
$10.000 will be practically funnelled to development of our token launchpad - so website with registration, news, updates, KYC, database backend. You are correct, we did not mention the token sale because we were still developing our initial whitepaper. I published it now, so please take a look at it and write feedback!
 
Finally, our whitepaper is in the attachment, please take the time to read it for real up-to-date details on the system!
Help us Shape the world with truth!

About ADAPlus.io
The adoption of the Cardano cryptocurrency is constantly growing, and businesses will soon be required to provide convenient ways to send mass payments to a large number of recipients. For example, payments of earned commissions in affiliate programs, payouts to investors, or payments to a team of freelancers working on a project. Unfortunately, none of the existing popular Cardano wallets allow this. ADAPlus will make mass payments with minimum fees and a minimum investment of time possible.
The minimum transaction fee in Cardano is about 0.17₳. With a large number of payments to different addresses, it can add up to a significant amount. The fee depends on the amount of information sent in a transaction, typically about 300 bytes. The transaction cost calculation for Cardano is as follows: a base price is 0.155381₳ per transaction and 0.000043946₳ per transferred byte. The maximum size of one transaction is limited to 16kb, resulting in a maximum fee of about 0.875₳. With the help of ADAPlus, one fully-packed transaction can accommodate about 50 payments to different addresses. Such mass transactions will save you fees. For example, when making payments using a regular wallet, you would pay at least 8.5₳ for 50 separate payments that would require a lot of work copying and pasting addresses and amounts. Combining 50 payments into one transaction will only cost about 0.8₳, providing savings of more than 10x.
ADAPlus will enable you to send any number of payments to multiple recipients in one click.
 
The workflow
The user logs into the ADAPlus website and imports a file containing the list of addresses and payments. After loading the list of addresses, the system retrieves and analyzes a significant amount of information from the blockchain to provide detailed information about the owners of addresses on the list. Such information will include the wallet creation date (first transaction), staking and pool delegation history, and the maximum value of the wallet, etc.
Then the user can work with the list, add or remove addresses, or adjust payment amounts according to various parameters. It is also possible to send a transaction's metadata (message) with the transaction. For example, the sender can thank recipients or include the payout identifier for affiliate programs. We will use extended CIP-0020 that can also send separate messages to different UTxOs.
ADAPlus allows pool operators to get a list of delegators per epoch. Then, SPOs, willing to reward their delegators, can send additional individual rewards based on delegators' loyalty, amounts of delegated funds, history, newcomers, etc. This feature alone provides a lot of possibilities for new marketing campaigns to attract new delegators.
ADAPlus calculates and displays the minimum amount required to make all payments. In addition, it optimizes the structure of the transaction to keep fees as low as possible. For example, in the case of many addresses that cannot fit into one transaction, the service will reorganize and split payments into multiple transactions that have the lowest fees.
 
Wallets
There are three approaches that ADAPlus can provide, and they require different experience levels.
Beginner level
The most straightforward way to provide mass-payments tools to clients is to create and store wallets on the ADAPlus side. The client only needs to send a calculated total amount to the address before performing mass payments. In that case, ADAPlus will take care of optimizing/splitting/packing payments into transactions, adding metadata, and signing & submitting transactions to the network. No technical knowledge is required from the client.
Risks and obstacles: This approach has risks associated with storing private keys to make transactions.
Intermediate level
The client can pass a final list of addresses and amounts to his wallet like Yoroi, Daedalus, AdaLite, Medusa. The wallet will take care of calculating fees, combining UTxOs, and sending funds.
Risks and obstacles: This has the lowest risk level. The only problem is that none of the current popular wallets allow those features. However, we have already started discussing a possible implementation of that feature that will, in the long run, benefit not only ADAPlus but the whole ecosystem. So we are willing to start working on a standard for passing payments that all wallets can implement.
Expert level
ADAPlus will generate copy-paste bash instructions that will run on any machine with cardano-cli installed and a node running. All private keys are stored on the client's side.
Risks and obstacles: Some users, such as pool operators, are familiar with working from a command line and may prefer this for maximum transparency. But for Luddites installing a node and even copy-pasting commands will be a challenge.
The order of implementation
We will start with implementing the third Expert level as it does not require a lot of development time, it's transparent, and does not require ""trust"" in sending funds to ADAPlus wallets. We want to avoid any risks associated with holding clients' money. Because of that, we will be asking clients not to store their funds on ADAPlus, but to top up a required amount and perform payments right after that. We hope popular wallets see the potential of sending mass payment transactions and implement a bridge in the form of a URL scheme link or a QR code.
 
Use cases
Marketing tool for Pool Operators - Mass payments to existing or new delegators
Unlike other blockchain explorers targeted towards transaction details or pool information, ADAPlus will also work as an explorer aimed at addresses and delegators. Any pool can get a list of its delegators per any epoch using flexible search filters. Lists with delegators' addresses can be saved or exported for future mass payments. Those features will allow SPOs to run different flexible marketing campaigns. As an example, you can guarantee your delegators will get 6% ROI rewards for zero-blocks epochs. A [VICE] pool is already using the ADAPlus platform for epochs calculations and performing mass payments. Conditions can be more flexible. For example, new delegators will get additional fixed amounts based on the gradation of the stake they provide. On significant dates, SPO may reward its most loyal delegators. ADAPlus saves a lot of time for pool operators and makes such marketing campaigns simple.
Delegators directory - search, filtering, analysis
ADAPlus will have a pools directory and a delegators directory. The pools directory is aimed to promote smaller SPOs running mission-driven pools or offering marketing benefits to delegators. It will not use a rating similar to Daedalus or AdaPools that provides benefits only to saturated popular pools. Pool owners can register subdomains in the system with the name of their ticker and display pool stats, announcements, and current promotions. Along with a pools directory, ADAPlus will have a catalog of delegators with a rating, depending on the delegated amount, delegation history, transactions history, wallet creation time, and some other parameters. This directory will provide pool operators with a tool to shape their marketing policies and run tests and calculations. For example, you can determine the average amount of delegation to a staking pool, the activity of using Cardano by delegates, and to find out what events influenced the transition of a group of users to another pool. In addition, it is possible to study delegators' behavior locally for one specific pool and globally as general user movement patterns under different events. For instance, when luck in pools decreases for several consequent epochs or when the commission percentage rises.
Payouts from affiliate marketing
As cryptocurrency adoption grows, many online affiliate programs start to offer payouts to webmasters in cryptocurrencies to lower fees and simplify the process. ADAPlus will make the payout process convenient and straightforward. This can induce additional popularity and adoption of Cardano into the affiliate marketing business as transaction fees are much lower than making payouts in BTC or ETH. In addition, packing many payments into a single transaction saves businesses money.
Suppose the contextual advertising network has thousands of partners who want to receive payments in Cardano with existing wallets. In that case, this becomes an almost impossible task that requires colossal, time-consuming, and monotonous actions. The system will make it possible to make such payments in one click, saving more than 10x on fees.
Investment funds and others
Many businesses need to make mass payments regularly. A list of recipients or amounts may differ every time. By exporting lists to a simple CSV format and importing it to ADAPlus, the process is simplified as the system immediately analyzes their audience.
 
Roadmap
Stage 0 - Proof of Concept (up to 2 months of development)
We will release a website that SPOs can use to send rewards to delegators based on different parameters. We want to deliver a working proof of concept before Fund 6 ends. For intense testing from our developers and everyone from the community, we will provide three independent versions that will work with the Cardano mainnet, testnet, and a guild network. You will be able to perform test mass payments with tADA without having to spend real ADA.
Stage 1 - Active development (up to 6 months)
Creating a delegators directory and flexible search/filters to be able to analyze and export lists.
Active FE and BE developing.
Stage 2 - Wallets solutions (up to 3 months of development)
Launching internal wallets to simplify payments for clients that need it.
Security audit for implementing internal wallets performed by one of the external companies.
Improvements on CIP-13 (Cardano URI scheme) to include mass payments.
Onboarding as many popular wallets as possible to support CIP-13.
 
Stage 3 - Marketing, ondoarding larger companies
Educational resources and marketing materials explaining the benefits of using Cardano for mass payments.
Onboarding larger companies that can benefit from payouts in ADA.

1.The Business Model
COLLUDE is a digital platform for all user groups in the film industry. We are unique in the way we will bring together the different sectors of the film industry (authors, actors, agencies, producers, etc.) and provide a fair and equitable environment. We will ensure privacy and safety for all industry participants by creating a structure that rewards positive contributions by participants. But COLLUDE is not just a platform for networking and sharing, as there are already many in the industry. The platform is not merely a large database of profiles of actors. Rather, it is a system where the origin and ownership of values are logged and made traceable in tandem with the casting and production processes.
By utilizing the Cardano network, values can be mapped, access rights can be transferred unambiguously and permanently from one user to another, and our system acts only as an intermediary. Rights to real-world assets can also be mapped digitally in the blockchain and thus traded. This opens up enormous automation potential. Until now, it is the case that on average between 20% and 50% of the invested capital is lost in every film production due to inefficient processes, costly casting, duplicate administrative, and distribution structures. The innovation of COLLUDE's business model is to redefine the industry conditions and reward structures for participants. We will begin with a grass-roots drive to bring amateur and aspiring actors, screenwriters, and directors to the platform, creating a groundswell of talent. We will progressively market the platform up the food chain as we build adoption, with the eventual goal of being the go-to medium for all production studios and funding ventures. COLLUDE will charge a modest fee for enterprises to use the platform, more than making up for itself through huge efficiency gains compared to the present industry standards. We envisage that a sizable proportion of the platform fees collected from professional and industry users will be re-invested into creative invective structures for beginner and aspiring participants, thus ultimately creating a positive-feedback-loop that strengthens the platform from the ground up.
2. The Technology
The lynchpin of COLLUDE's strategy is the technology that makes our business model possible. Our innovation lies in utilizing and integrating three pillars - software architecture – cutting-edge AI - and decentralized blockchain technology. The software architecture can be defined at an abstract level as being the organization and interaction of all elements of a software system. By including a wide variety of principles, such as conceptual integrity, separation of responsibilities, visibility, and/self-organization, this structure can be made long-lasting and future-proof. This is especially relevant for those systems that are subject to a certain evolution and need to be constantly developed. While not in-and-of-itself revolutionary, our approach is to implement a best-practice design that allows for future scalability. Therefore, the mere development and implementation of a generic software system are not enough. COLLUDE uses an event-based architecture style and the CQRS (Command-Query-Responsibility-Segregation) pattern. Our architecture is based on so-called microservices, which act autonomously and manage their own area of responsibility. On the one hand, this software architecture allows unpredictable requirements (functionalities) to be implemented, while on the other hand allowing for the integration of the latest technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, etc. Furthermore, in addition to its high adaptability and flexibility, the software architecture also affords a high degree of scaling potential in order to react efficiently and effectively to unpredictable user requests. (Graphical representation in the appendix) The development of AI is based on two different developments:

The development of a classical matching algorithm (recommendation engine); and
NLG (natural language Generation ).

In COLLUDE, a transformer architecture (GPT 3 model) is used for the NLG. This is a pre-trained model, which is very powerful but also very general. The challenge in the development is to adapt it for COLLUDE-specific service and provide a toolkit to help actors and writers practice their arts . We'll also be using text recognition to transform the inherent structure in film scripts into usable data. The enriched data then flows together in a classical matching algorithm. Preliminary work is already progressing on both parts of the AI. The challenge will be to fully implement them in the software architecture. Finally, the Cardano blockchain will provide the architecture for users to transfer and transact, verify, and trust. Given that the network and its scaling solutions are still works-in-progress, we are also yet to finalize our full implementation strategy. However, use cases such as allowing users to pay and collect revenue using crypto-assets (native and wrapped), attach rights to data (NFTs), verify identity (DID), and transact fairly (business logic) will all be implemented into the platform as it develops. We intend for all such useful functions which are facilitated by COLLUDE to take place over the Cardano network (and its scaling solutions). We envisage that as COLLUDE and the Cardano network both grow, further use-cases will evolve and we want to create a platform that can quickly pivot to utilize the latest trends. By allowing users to interact with the platform via their own crypto-wallet, we will be further empowering the film-making industry from the ground up, while aligning to the greater goal of the crypto-currency space: financial independence for every person.
Market Information
Film Costs/Time

A 20min Short film Cost 5.000 - 35.000 Euro
The risks are too high when creating a film
Planning is analog with unreliable data

Actors

Actors have a 0.04% chance of finding a role
Actors don't get paid enough for time on set

Screenplay Writers

Writers have a 0.3% chance of their screenplay being seen
Writers don't get royalties for the Idea they created

Producers

Producers have problems finding the right screenplays
Producers have problems finding the right actors
Producers can't find specialists to work on set

Through the involvement of numerous third parties. There is No trust, transparency, or quality control throughout the process of film development. Because of these factors, many artists in the film industry suffer the consequences.
How We Do It
Building the Film industry from the bottom-up won't be an easy task. However, The Use of First principle thinking and a Bottom-Up approach: to build a self-sustaining ecosystem will help achieve the goal. To do develop the system here a couple of examples of specific questions we ask:
QUESTION:""What elements are needed for a film? ""
The answer:

The Idea - Screenplay Writer

 

Captivating & Internalising The Idea - Actors,

 

Visualizing The Idea - Director Of Photography with camera crew:  

 

Organizing The Idea - Producers ***

 

Film Funding Entities - Film Funding Entities***

 
 
*** These elements can be replaced through the use of technology which is more efficient, organizing and funding can be provided in many different ways***
QUESTION: ""What overarching elements are needed in all sectors? ""
The answer:
Starting out (First Steps) - Focuses on the users' orientation, helping them better understand the film industry. Using documentation, video, and other communication mediums, collude provides transparency, which will help new artists get the information they need.

Self-help - provides the artist's infrastructure to improve and get feedback on their performance and create a future outlook
Making Money (Monetisation) - enabling the artist to use their talents to find or create the perfect working opportunity
Working Methods and Connectivity - is a more straightforward and efficient way to work using more collaborative tools. Direct contact and efficient exchange of information helps the artist to work together.
Building trust & Transparency - with the data that collude gathers. It is possible to create quarterly/yearly market reports endorsing a fair playing field for all.

The Platform will first focus on empowering these elements for Screenplay Writers, Actors, Directors & Camera Crew and in the future, other stakeholders that are necessary for film development such as costume, sound effects etc. Providing an architecture that enhances organization and equity. This architecture creates a swarm effect in which the decentralized collective can achieve any goal.
Why Cardano?
Collude's mission statement is ""We listen"". Listening is the major part of our strategy and market approach. It's crucial to create a safe domain in which the community can easily & safely communicate their hardships and pains. Through listening, it's possible to create an environment in which knowledge is shared with the possibility to collaborate toward a common purpose or even creating ​​ a sense of urgency to help others to get involved and attain meaningful goals. Listening is the first stage in building a collective identity that is distinctive throughout the market. The Cardano Ecosystem has a lot of parallels with the goals we want to achieve and the technology stack fits perfectly to the platform.
Platform Model & Technology Use
For Colludes revenue is based on a subscription model - 50% of the revenue provided by subscriptions will be automatically allocated to USER's wallet as ADA ( Flowchart ). This is only done after the user has activated his or her own wallet because the wallet is essential to participating in the ecosystem. The ecosystem is interactions primarily based on the functionalities of the wallet.
Wallet Uses:

Voting on: Collude Platform development, Commenting/Reviewing Projects, Film Projects development, & Film Project Funding
Income: Staking & Other means of income (i.e Defi - Loan, Credit, Collateral )
NFT's - Auctioning, Buying and Licensing Screenplays,
Approvals & Reviews, Starting Film projects, etc.
Technology Stack:
 Blockchain- Creating trust and transparency
Enabling screenplay writers & other parties to safely store and track their Ideas as it's being created.

Creating film development Dapps/Tools

NFT's - For distinction & verification
Enabling Users to buy, sell & license i.e. -screenplays with the ability to earn royalties
Using QR Codes to verify the legitimacy of screenplay owners
Automation entities to automate complicated procedures.
For each party involved, we will create 2-3 Standard open contracts enabling users to choose what best fits their needs.
Contracts are automatically executed after conditions are met for parties involved
Defi - Providing equity, liquidity, and capital for platform users:
Film Project Funding
Individual Platform Users

A.I. - helps to answer these questions:

What is a screenplay?
What is the screenplay value?
What objects are in the screenplay? and how can they be valued?
What actors are in the screenplay? the actors' descriptions?
Is it possible to find Actors for certain acting roles (if the user chooses)
Is it possible to make acting scenes for actors to practice? (GPT3)

Actors & Writers: User Journey
Actors
Starting out (First Steps) - After creating a user profile as seen in the click dummy . Actors have the ability to view personalized screenplays based on their profiles. The Screenplays will be generated based on the matching algorithm or determined from producers/agencies who are Self-help & Working Methods and Connectivity - looking for actors for a film project. Actors are also able to:

Practice screenplays that have been generated by the algorithm.
Watch other actors casting videos who have been cast for the same role
Pick casting partners for scene dialog
View diverse screenplays and other actors which have been cased
Improved castings videos through the help of mentors

Building trust & Transparency - Each video the actor records the metadata will be added to the blockchain for future validation. After casting has been processed actors will automatically be notified (smartphone) if their casting video has been accepted for the project. A process that is not shown in the click dummy is the selection of the actor's terms and conditions regarding their contact- there will be 2-3 different contact types that actors can select. The contracts are saved in the wallet for later use and before the film project is started all have the ability to view their contact and their signature will be made through the use of the wallet password.
Making Money (Monetisation) - If actors have been accepted into the project it enables them to start working without being uncertain of contractual obligations
Screenplay Writers
Starting out (First Steps) & Self-help & Working Methods and Connectivity - After the writer's profile has been created. The writer has the possibility to:

Find Ideas for screenplays
Write a screenplays
Allow screenplays to be reviewed & revised
Collaborate on screenplays
Upload a screenplay on the platform
Sell, License, & Auction Screenplays

Building trust & Transparency - Certain metadata about the screenplay is saved on the blockchain. When a screenplay is uploaded the platform algorithm verifies and checks the database for duplicates or screenplays with the same characteristics. The individual users are notified if conflicts occur. All screenplays created on the platform will be created with QR codes which will help to certify the screenplays. If the QR code is scant it will display the data regarding ownership of the screenplay and other relevant information.
Making Money (Monetisation) - After the screenplay has been created. At the user's disposal, they can sell their screenplays (NFT) for a monetary value or create a project enabling actors to join with the ability to produce the screenplay.
Our Goals

Through empowering artists, it enables them to be the backbone of the film industry Purpose and achieve the following goals
Creating a safety net and guidance for film industry participants
Enables artists to have economic freedom throughout the film industry.
Enables new Ideas and content to be present to end consumers

Nami Wallet is a browser based wallet extension and can be injected into the browser context in order to interact with dApps (decentralized apps).
Nami can be downloaded from the Google Chrome Store here: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nami-wallet/lpfcbjknijpeeillifnkikgncikgfhdo and already has over 2000 users.
The wallet utilizes the serialization-lib (https://github.com/Emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib) for wallet keys creation and transaction building. Blockfrost (blockfrost.io) is used in order to fetch blockchain information, making the wallet a light-client wallet but it can also be turned into a full node wallet since you are able to connect your own node.
The wallet can handle thousands of assets, it displays them with images and allows you to quickly search through them.
Our goals are to enable users to interact with Cardano to its full capacity, to bring smart contract support in, all the while making the interface user-friendly and keeping the entry barrier low. That way, people can join the ecosystem without having much prior experience with blockchain or cryptocurrencies.
The next steps will be to:
- Acquire feedback on the current wallet and to see what users want
- Contribute on existing libraries such as the serialization-lib and standards
- Support smart contracts
- Making real use cases example by implementing Nami in the SpaceBudz marketplace
- Create tools and libraries to make it easier for developers to interact with Nami
- Creating a hub website showcasing Wallet & tooling functionalities
- Extend Nami with hardware wallet support and a mobile version
- Improve Nami API documentation & provide code implementation examples

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Based on the reading of the Djed paper (https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/djeda-formally-verified-crypto-backed-pegged-algorithmic-stablecoin/), we believe we can have a fully implemented solution within 4 months beginning September 1 for our start date.
An existing implementation of the Minimal Djed protocol is actively being worked on here but does not take into account various attacker models described in the Djed paper. We are prepared to implement, test, verify, deploy, and maintain such implementation.
Resourcing
We have 4 Developers who will work full time on the project. The developers have varying levels of experience. The team includes PhDs in Type Checking Languages, experienced Ethereum developers, and the entire team has gone through the Pioneers program.
We also have 1 Engineering Manager, and 1 Product Manager who will work part time for the duration of the project to ensure a high quality product which meets all of the requirements of a successful stablecoin.
Engineering Design
At a high level, the project will take in 3 phases:

Implementation of the Extended Djed protocol into Plutus
Verification of #2 using Isabelle
Deployment of Extended Djed on Cardano Mainnet and final testing

We utilize a sprint model of development and will regularly post blog posts about the progress.
Timeline
Based on our reading of the Djed paper, we expect the following timeline

2 months - Design and Implementation
1 month - Verification
1 month - Deployment and Test

Finances
Working 40 hours a week for all devs for 4 months continuous, we expect our total cost to be $372,000. We accept payment in ADA.

cardano-tools.io: Cardano features for everyone
Often things like minting, burning, tracking tokens or registering tokens in the cardano-token-registry is not accessible for non-technical users. And with Alonzo there will be more and more usecases wich are not covered by userfriendly tools like Daedalus and are only acessible trough command line.
To solve the problem the opensource webapplication cardano-tools.io was founded. It already coveres multiple workflows, but we want to keep it up-to-date and extended it with more features and upcomming tasks wich ware not covered by the major wallets.

BingoToken will aim to disrupt the Bingo gaming sector by incentivizing callers to give real money/crypto prizes without players gambling.",16,"Thursday, 19 August 2021 14:42",Enrico Saunders,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Enrico-Saunders/3081898-48088,,,10000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


BingoChain with its accompanying BingoToken will aim to disrupt the Bingo gaming sector by providing a way to play for real value (even real money) without the gamer risking any of their own money. By incentivizing both the caller (organizer) and players with BingoTokens we aim to get callers to put real money into their games.
- Callers and Winners will get one BingoToken for each player in their game.
- Normal players who don't win will get a single BingoToken for each card they play in the game.
- Players can acquire more cards to play by inviting friends to join.
- Players can start games with more cards to play by keeping more BingoTokens in their linked wallet.
So, as BingoToken is distributed more widely and as its adoption and value grows, callers will be incentivized to put more value (ADA or USD) on the line to attract more players and in turn get more BingoTokens as a result.
Players will have the thrill of competing for real value and our system is built to encourage community engagement by allowing callers to choose any type of meeting to call the game: Zoom, Google Meet, Twitch, Facebook, Teams etc.
We already have the development to a stage where we can run games and distribute BingoTokens and we would love feedback from the community. Funding will be used for ADA or USD prizes on some games which should kick start the ecosystem by attracting players and callers.
We'll host demo games every week on https://bingochain.io so anyone who is interested can join us for a game!
 
Further Info:
The idea began when a Casino Manager was locked out of his casino along with all his patrons when covid hit. Looking for a way to keep going he started distributing physical Bingo Cards and calling games over an online meeting. It soon became too popular to manage and we helped him by developing an online game geared towards real meetings. We soon realized we can enhance the experience by incorporating crypto into the game. We could remove the players risk without removing the reward – thus we started developing BingoChain.
We initially minted BingoToken on the Binance Chain and developed the game to a point where we could start playing real games to get feedback from the community. We struggled to attract interest whilst on the Binance network. Whilst we were developing the game, we gained interest in the Cardano blockchain and decided to get involved with the project and since then we have gained experience as a Cardano Stake Pool operator (AXNSA Pool) and have also seen the astonishing growth (and willingness to help) of the Cardano community, so we decided to make the shift and minted our token on the Cardano network.
 
User Experience
1. Log in to BingoChain.io
2. Fill in your profile details and enter your ADA wallet address.
3. Play a Bingo Game (there will be a live stream or online meeting to join – just click the link it the Game screen)
4. On completion of the Game:
• All Players - Receive one BingoToken for every card you played if you didn't win.
• Winner - Receive a number of BingoTokens equal to the total amount of players.
• Caller - Receive a number of BingoTokens equal to the total amount of players.
5. Tokens will be paid directly to your Cardano wallet at the end of the game. (Not yet implemented)
 
Example Token Distribution
• If you played 3 cards, you will get 3 Bingo Tokens if you didn't win,
• If 25 players played in a game that you won, you will receive 25 Bingo Tokens
• If 50 players played in a game that you called, you will receive 50 Bingo Tokens
If there were any ADA offered as a prize the ADA would also be distributed to the winner.
If there were any other prizes like USD, USDT or BTC in the game, the caller will need to distribute these after the completion of the game.
* Note that we will be running regular demo games from the Registration phase so that users can interact with the system – Join us on BingoChain.io to be among the first to receive BingoTokens. Note that the automatic distribution script has not been completed, so we will manually distribute BingoTokens for users who have accumulated more than 100 tokens.
 
Q&A: What do I do with the BingoTokens?
We plan to build in various utility for them in the BingoChain.io system, things like allowing players to have more initial cards, callers to host more players etc.
We will also apply to list them on Cardano Native Token DEXs when they kick off once the Alonzo upgrade is completed. If it takes too long to get listed on at least one DEX, we may even offer buy-backs directly in the BingoChain.io system so that users can exchange their BingoTokens for ADA.
 
Development Roadmap
The BingoChain development has already completed the proof-of-concept phase and is currently in refinement phase.
 
Phase 1 Development – Proof-of-Concept Completed
• Concept Design ✓
• Mint Token: 10 million tokens minted ✓
• Logo Design ✓
• Product Development – POC written as an Angular Application on the MEAN stack - 10 Weeks ✓
• Product Testing and Private User Feedback ✓
 
Phase 2 (Ongoing)
• Community Growth
• Host Public Games – Distribute Tokes and Gain User Feedback
• Refine and Enhance Game Experience
• Allow callers to send ADA to a Hot-Wallet as a way to provide additional ADA prizes in the caller's games
• Build the distribution script to execute on game completion which should:
o batch all the BingoToken (and ADA if applicable) distributions into a single transaction
o write the game data (game id, numbers drawn, winner info, winning card numbers) to the Cardano Blockchain to provide immutable proof and auditability of the pseudo-random number generator and winning card numbers.
 
Phase 3 (Future)
• Integrate Atala Prism as a login option
• Build more utility for BingoToken in the BingoChain ecosystem (see more info below)
• Develop App for mobile devices
• List tokens on Cardano DEX(s)
• Babel Fees - Approach stake pools to support BingoToken on their pools
 
Use of Funding
Catalyst Funds will be used to make crypto or cash (ADA and USD*) prizes available in the games as a way of attracting more players to the ecosystem to jump start the BingoChain player community and the BingoToken economy. Thus, the money will all be re-invested into the platform by giving back to the community.

Create a smart contract on Cardano / Polkadot to facilitate messaging. Create a multilanguage open-source package so other devs can use it.",40,"Thursday, 19 August 2021 14:03",wValthar,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/wValthar/3062101-48088,,,15000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
In order for the web-3 vision, of decentralized networks to become the backbone of the internet, we need to be able to pass messages to one another. You have a couple of competing standards in the space currently. You can utilize Polkadot, Cosmos, Chainlinks CCIP, and several other smaller ecosystems. The goal is to create all the infrastructure necessary to pass messages between ecosystems, allowing developers from other ecosystems to more easily utilize Cardano with their projects. The first project will be a Polkadot Cardano bridge. This is the easiest to implement and will be a quick win for the Cardano ecosystem, bridging it to BTC, EOS, DOT, and Ethereum. 
This is important because let's say a user wants to have an insurance smart contract that pays them in DAI. Currently, the developer would need to run the smart contract on the Ethereum network. If there is a bridge, the developer could run the smart contract on Cardano, and have it pass a message to Etherum to pay the user the correct amount. 
How this impacts challenge questions/metrics
This project will attract users and developers to the ecosystem by making it possible for them to move their currencies into the Cardano ecosystem, increasing liquidity. This will also allow Cardano to be used as the backend for new projects while making it possible for developers to allow users to be paid in whichever currency they wish. You will have pBTC, pETH, pEOS, etc. Polkadot was chosen as the first messaging system to target because it is the lowest hanging fruit, which means the project will be brought to market quicker. 
What does this mean for Cardano?
There will be increased liquidity inside the Cardano ecosystem. If we can pass messages to and from Cardano to Polkadot, we can take advantage of the bridges that exist there. There will be access to BTC, Ethereum, EOS, and several other chains within the Cardano ecosystem. 
This will help developers create cross-chain applications. There are a lot of advantages to using Cardano as the backend for smart contracts. It should be a cheaper and safer alternative as compared to other ecosystems. If we have a bridge, this will allow other ecosystems to use Cardano as the backend, while letting the user use whichever ecosystem they prefer.
Definition of Success
3 months: The bridge will be built during this time period. 
6 months: The developer toolkit to work with Cardano, BTC, ETH, EOS, and Polygon will be built. 
12 months: The goal will be for a fully functioning website, with GUI to transfer assets between these blockchains with wallet integrations will be built.
Project Scope
This project is for the creation of the bridge and for the dev kit. There will be future funding rounds to integrate with other messaging standards. The goal will be for the completion of the scope from February - March 2022. 
Budget
$15,000 total.
Technical equipment, server fees, and software - $4,700.
Business administration costs and licenses - $1,000.
Outsourcing for non-technical components of the project to speed up project delivery date - $6,000.

The Catalyst Circle
IOG is currently managing the Catalyst Project, with the aspiration to decentralize Governance to the community. The Catalyst Circle is the first experiment to establish a decentralized instance, that has four major goals:
To facilitate communication between the different functional groups
To provide a heads-up when red lines are crossed within a certain group
To suggest improvements on plans and processes that shape Project Catalyst
To define the election process for Circle V2
Link: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/08/introducing-the-catalyst-circle/
Member duties and responsibilities
Like Project Catalyst itself, the Circle will also evolve over time. Initially, elected members will serve 3-month terms, and elections will follow to continue improving and iterating the process. For elected members, we have identified these initial duties and responsibilities. Each member of the Circle should:

Represent the community that selected them
Exercise their own best judgement about matters that come before the Circle
Familiarize other members with the projects, activities, aims, hopes, and concerns of their communities
Periodically take the opportunity to introduce policy proposals into the Circle's agenda for consideration
Inform their communities about initiatives of the Circle

Each member also has the responsibility to:

Regularly attend meetings every two weeks
Maintain an agile backlog list to track issues between meetings
Review and comment on agenda issues ahead of time
Maintain awareness of the interests and concerns of their community
Disseminate the Circle's outputs transparently and accessibly
Learn and practice effective meeting procedures
Produce an election protocol document for the next elections
Attend training sessions focused on inclusive and lean startup leadership techniques
Provide feedback on the effectiveness of the Circle

Members will be able to set each meeting's agenda and periodically introduce policy proposals into the Catalyst Circle for consideration. The 'minimal functional group' is the bootstrapping version, based on consultations with leaders within the Catalyst community, an expert group in the field of novel governance structures.
As trusted best practice is established, the Circle might grow and divide. Maybe the future has many 'Circles'? Ultimately, it will be up to members to advance our goal to legitimise decentralized governance, paving the way for an alternative to the status quo, and continuing to break new ground in building the future of blockchain governance.
Roadmap (3 months) November 2021 - January 2022
Catalyst Circle 1, which has been operating since 12th of July 2021. The group has established a process to funnel work mainly focusing on addressing major problems identified within the various stakeholder groups (for more details please see here: https://trello.com/b/DRBO6qyF/catalyst-prioritized-problems).
The roadmap for Catalyst Circle 2 is mainly driven by the goals and responsibilities mentioned above. The backlog of problems and issues already backlogged in the trello board will give the CC2 a starting point to execute on. Nevertheless, since the Catalyst Circle 1 is still in its beginnings, additional issues will naturally evolve within the Catalyst Circle 2 - together with progression of the Fund Circles and Project CAtalyst structure and systems.
The Catalyst Circle commits to attend weekly town hall meetings to provide updates on progress as well as engage with the community on relevant ad hoc topics that might arise.

We started to build, grow and maintain a Vietnamese Cardano community 4 years ago, here in Vietnam. Currently our social channels (Telegram and Facebook) include and inform more than 4000 Vietnamese community members about cardano and catalyst related news and content. One of our main goals is to include the Vietnamese community into project catalyst and to become part of a diverse and global community. Some very first steps in regard to including Vietnamese stakeholders in project catalyst, is to offer some easy tools with which the Vietnamese community can be included in the catalyst process.
One of these tools is presented in this proposal and we hope to get your support for our mission. providing tools and access to Vietnamese people to the Cardano ecosystem.
Rounds of review
To evaluate submitted proposals in project Catalyst, the process includes 2 separate stages: 2MIN and DETAIL. Each stage consists a different goal.
Stage 1: 2MIN review
Everyone can review the proposals within 2 minutes to determine if the proposals are ready to run or not. A proposal that should be funded is:
The team members are

(1) identifiable,
(2) interactive,
(3) carefully prepared for a clearly, and detailed plan.

The Vietnamese Catalyst voting community will evaluate all proposals on based on 3 criteria:

Profile of members
Activities of members
Detailed plan

This round does not require a profound knowledge about blockchain and cryptocurrencies nor a high level of English language skills. The main task focus on the proof of following criteria:
Does the Proposal owner(s)

Publish their profile - YES/NO
Interacts with the community - YES/NO
Well prepared their proposal - YES/NO

Stage 2: DETAIL review
Vietnamese Community advisors will evaluate the proposals which gain more than 3 scores in the 2MIN review stage based on 5 criteria:

Problem statements
Solution
Team's background
Milestones
Budget plan

Reward for CAs
What is EP score?
EP means experience power score, the proof of
Used as a parameter to calculate 2MIN average score and DETAIL average score.
Based on the reliability assessments of the 2MIN round.
Each of your Primary scores that deviate by less than 30% from the Detailed Score Average is considered a reliable assessment.
For example: A proposal with an average score of 2MIN stage equals 3. If your 2MIN score between 2.1 and 3.9, then you get 1 reliable assessment.
EP levels:

EP=1: achieve 0-100 reliable assessments.
EP=2: achieve 200-300 reliable assessments.
EP=3: achieve 300-500 reliable assessments.
EP=4: achieve 500-800 reliable assessments.
EP=5: achieve more than 800 reliable assessments.

What is AR score?
AR means activity result score
Used as a parameter to calculate reward for CAs, vCAs. And to allocate personnel to specialized positions.
Based on the activities of members. Each activity below might get 1 AR score:

Gain 100 reliable assessments in 2MIN review stage
Gain 20 reliable assessments in DETAIL review stage
Translate into Vietnamese 1 proposal
Top 10 supporters
Invited 5 new members join into the group
(... and more additional tasks in another sheet)

Result
Vina CAs team started a first pilot in Catalyst Fund 5 (without the Detail round) and improved the process and design of the 2MIN review round with 30+ participants which assessed submitted proposals. See the report sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ke4KvGHn4Hzzp5bAhFiMmUp-fwS6A1BIBs6lKyROn4/edit#gid=836317883
Also, we have helped hundred voters to vote in fund5.
What will we do next time?
*In 3 next months:

Evaluate in the DETAIL stage
Support the Voting community to vote
Support new members to evaluate in the 2MIN stage
Help 200 Vietnames to assess the proposals in F6, F7

*In 6 next months

Short interviews by Mie Tran and co-host(s) that get directly to the point and ask the hard questions to explore the proposers for why, what, and how. The interviews will bring an element of spontaneity that lets viewers get to know the proposer and help voters decide on the best projects by providing a medium where they can learn about proposals that are presented in the same format.
The interviews will be translated into several languages, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,… Proposers will get global publicity around their projects and can increase voter trust and understanding by posting a link to these videos in their projects. Low effort ways to engage voters in assessing proposals and tapping into existing insights.
 
● Improved trust - meet the proposer in a live one-on-one conversation with Ms. Mie Tran as she asks probing questions to learn what makes him/her tick, why he/she made the proposal, and how it will impact the world. You may be surprised by the answers.
● Improve browsability of Catalyst - No longer do voters have to read proposals in several formats or watch videos in different and lengths. Everyone gets 90 seconds to impress the audience.
● More educated voters - everyone should be able to simplify their proposal into a 90-second elevator pitch. If you can't make an impression during the 90-second interview, it is a good time to step back and reflect.
● Great recruiting tool - Once a project is voted in, the video will be a great way to communicate with the community especially asking for help.

5.1. Before going to the implementation plan, we would like to present some reasons for Creating Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide
At the end of September 2021 it is expected that we will activate Smart Contract. That will be the time to mark the landing of a series of projects running on the Cardano platform, contributing to the expansion of the ecosystem in the future.
And the Catalyst Project is a very important part of the expansion of that ecosystem.
But, the results of the Cardano Vietnam community survey show: about 89% don't know how to evaluate and vote for Catalyst Proposals. In fact, not only the Vietnamese community, but many people in the Cardano communities around the world are also facing the same situation. The total circulating supply is about 32B ADA but only about 2.3B ADA (less than 10%) participated in the voting of Catalyst Fund4 Proposals (taking place from 15-25 June 2021). If we compare this to the election of The Council of the People's Deputies, then 90% of the population does not participate in the election.
This is really a big problem for the community as well as for the Catalyst project, but it is also the basis for us to create the ""Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide"".
The goal of the ""Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide"" is not to find projects and recommend the community to invest, but to help the community to evaluate proposals by themselves. That's what's best for the community, so they can move on their own later.
5.2. Kế hoạch thực hiện:
5.2.1. Month #1,2,3
- Develop a set of evaluation criteria including: General Criteria and Specific Criteria (Dapps, Defi, DEX...)
- Completing the ""Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide"" (Details of each job will be updated and added before October 7, 2021).
- Deploy the ""Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide"" for at least 200 people.
5.2.2. Month #4,5,6
Community Survey about ""Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide"" --> Get Feedback --> Review --> Improvement according to PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) --> Community Report
5.3. Metrics to measure:
- Completing the "" Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide "" : 2021/10/E
- Number of people using the "" Catalyst Proposal Assessment Guide "" to Vote for Fund8: at least 200 people.

The problem : How to maintain Community Oversight
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-circle/ ) has been maintained since July 11th 2021. It documents and tracks the activities of the Catalyst Circle a initiative started by IOHK to advance governance in Project Catalyst.
At present this oversight is being maintained on a voluntary unpaid basis and takes approx 27 hours a month to complete ( see the weekly breakdown of hours worked below). This level of commitment is not sustainable in the medium term without being resourced.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The solution: Resourced Community Oversight documentation, tracking & communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once funded, the Catalyst Circle Oversight GitBook will improve distributed decision making within the next two Catalyst rounds by documenting, tracking & communicating the activities, discussions and decisions of Catalyst Circle thereby making it more transparent and accessible to all.
The GitBook is maintained by QA-DAO ( https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/ ) in collaboration with Catalyst Circle and the Cardano & Project Catalyst communities. All content recorded is open source and licensed under Apache 2.0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secretary / Facilitator
This proposal is separate from the Catalyst Circle Secretary / Facilitator roles. And does not include any associated costs. All documentation and tracking described in this proposal is independent of Catalyst Circle resources.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracking the time spent on maintaining the GitBook
In order to provide a realistic estimate of resource requirements QA-DAO has been tracking the time spent on maintaining the GitBook. The raw Clockify data to 30th August 2021 can be found here ( https://github.com/Catalyst-Swarm/Catalyst-Circle-Co-ordination/blob/main/Documents/Clockify_Detailed_Report_01_01_2021-31_12_2021(1).csv).
A total of 27:40 hours have been spent to the 30th August 2021. Time was spent in July 2021 setting up the GitBook and documenting an extensive problem sensing exercise conducted by Catalyst Circle. It is estimated that a minimum of 27 hours will required to cover the current expansion of Catalyst Circle activities and initiatives.
A shift to note-taking on a proprietary platform inhibited documentation and tracking for Circle Meetings 3 and 4. More time will be allocated in September 2021 to resolve this issue.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Basically, my plan is to write a book beginning with an outlining of both beneficial and destructive properties in distributed systems from biology, physics, computer science, language, and culture. Category theory gives the ability to classify and technically define abstract structures from many different fields and see how they fit together. Taking the insight gained from the process of defining structures in these terms, my goal is to put together a minimal set of rules to govern a good collaborative experience and produce efficient results without the need for top-down control of the process. When you look at a functioning ecosystem in nature, all the organisms involved live in a balance between competition for resources and symbiotic relationships. No one creature has to act outside its natural behavior, and yet, the lives of all species continue. There are constraints on the capacity of adaptation in biology that aren't present in more abstract systems like human collaboration, so assessing which ones help provide beneficial structure and which inhibit innovation is an important distinction to consider.
I should also be able to work on some code to simulate these ideas, and get started on a proof of concept implementation of the resulting protocol.
Timeline:
Three Months: A good part of the writing should be done within this timeframe and some code samples to simulate ideas may also be available.
Six Months: The document and protocol specification should be complete, though it may take more time to implement it.
Twelve Months: I should be able to continue working on an implementation even after the funding period. Anyone else should be able to do the same, and hopefully the ideas generated by this project will improve the collaborative experience of the Cardano community 
 (Depending on the acceptance of my other proposals, timelines would be subject to change, and I reserve the right to interleave work on each project as I see fit. Some of the research I do for the other projects could give direction to this one and vise versa.)

The budget is for six months of work, beyond that, I'll probably just continue working on this project for free, because it will be useful for other things I want to do in the future. I've been living off of my savings in Ada since April and devoting most of my time to studying the Cardano platform and related topics. It would be nice to have an income besides bull runs in the price of Ada, so that I can focus on building free tools.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We intend to use the 1:1 DApp being developed in tandem with Gimbalabs as part of the feedback process. The feedback given by and to the Community Advisors could be tracked within this to create an anonymous but verifiable reputation for community advisors. This will incentivize advisors to better serve the community as a whole as it will be a trackable reputation that will in turn help them to get funds for the work they have done. This will also elicit better communication between advisors and the community which should help proposers with how to manage their proposals for an increased chance at funding.
We also intend to facilitate questions from the community available to everyone including the advisors to answer. This will help community members better gauge which representatives they align with which when taken together should represent the community in total. This will allow the community to better address current pain points and find solutions.
Problem: How do we encourage people to participate in decision making?
Solution: Community advisors feedback should be tracked to ensure quality feedback is being given to proposers to help their proposal pass. By doing this both advisors and proposers are rewarded through ADA if the proposal gets funding.
Problem: How do we ensure the group of decision makers is diverse and accessible to newcomers?
Solution: Accessibility of the decision makers is immediate since the 1:1 DApp allows for interaction between Advisors and proposers as well as a Reputation based system revolving around how well these interactions were. This allows for transparency as well as ensuring concerns are addressed.
Problem: How will we include the community in decision making? How can we ensure that the Catalyst process keeps iterating to improve?
Solution: By allowing the community to create and vote on pain points as well as remedies for them, it would ensure that we find and address the biggest issues quickly. This is a community centered approach that ensures they are always in the decision making process. This also ensures that we keep iterating to improve the process.

Guiding questions
How do we encourage people to participate in decision making?
Encouraging people to get and use their ADA in ways that benefit not only them, but also the Cardano network and mission involves incentivising them to do so. High quality, educational, inspiring professional videos showcasing Mission Driven Pools (MDPs) and the teams behind their positive activities and impacts can help better inform decision makers.
Videos showcasing stories on MDPs to help educate and inform ADA holders on the 'why, how and who to stake your ADA with' will close the existing gap in understanding throughout the global Cardano community at large, external ecosystems and global audiences.
 
How do we ensure the group of decision makers is diverse and accessible to newcomers?
ADA holders are globally distributed and engaged to varying degrees in the Cardano community. Newcomers onto the Cardano blockchain will number in the millions, with 1billion+ users in forecast projections (source). This means that there is and will be greater diversity throughout the Cardano community, involved with decision making, and using their voting power in the innovative Cardano Governance structures. Making this accessible to newcomers is imperative.
Videos that are accessible, multilingual and communicate in easy to understand ways are crucial to have 1billion + users deciding to use their ADA in ways that lead to greater decentralization of the network, greater security and greater rewards for all. All in all leading to accelerating positive progress in creating shared prosperity and sustainability with finance unlocked and redirected to projects and areas that need it most.
 
How will we include the community in decision making?
Step 1.
Decisions taken by the diverse community on how to use the Cardano blockchain and the direction of its development can be facilitated with informative, insightful and inspiring videos that enable SPOs to communicate with a global audience. SPOs can tell their stories and the prospects of receiving attractive returns on ADA staked with them, that in turn helps contribute to financing the work of making the world a better place.
 
Step 2.
ADA holders, now informed of the benefits and available pools, are engaged in staking with mission driven pools. They join the community of fellow delegators, and the wider Cardano community and help guide and inform each other about mission driven projects and pools sharing videos across platforms, that are in multiple languages, telling the stories and helping decision makers holding ADA or wishing to hold ADA.
 
Step 3.
SPOs have formed community groups that align on agreed vision and mission statements, and support mission driven projects. These groups help support each other to make decisions that are of benefit for their communities and global community at large, whether it be via voting on Project Catalyst Funded Challenges or Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Participation in decision making is greatly enhanced with the help of focused videos, that are shown and distributed across multiple platforms.
 
Video Plan and Budget: $9000 1 - 6 month timeline
 
If funded, will use funds to:
*(Make a 50 minute documentary that showcases mission driven pools, and SPOS globally - longform) (6 months)
* Make 6 shorter videos (1 per month) of 4 - 8 minutes long showcasing SPOs MDPs, across multiple continents, in multiple languages with subtitles, for global audiences (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania).
* Videos can be used in multiple settings (online promotional campaigns, IOG marketing, Cardano Foundation communication, Educational settings etc)
 
KPIs:
How many people wanted to learn more about Cardano due to the videos?
How many people learned more with the help of the videos?
How many people were helped by the videos with their decision to delegate with a mission driven stake pool?
How many new users came onto the Cardano blockchain with the help of the videos?
Use social media hashtags on Twitter to track, and number of likes and comments

Expanded Problem Statement
Despite the accolades for being the largest decentralised funding project with collaboration at the heart of its success, focusing on these positives and not recognising the current weaknesses, could introduce problems as Catalyst grows.
While collaboration is an important attribute of Catalyst, it is naive to ignore the fact that Catalyst is also competitive. There have been more losing proposals than winners. So in addition to pitching the value they can bring, some projects also resort to criticising proposals that are competing for the limited funds available in their challenge.
The absence of identity and credential verification for Community Advisers (CAs) and Veteran Community Advisers (VCAs) means that project members can create alternate accounts to submit negative reviews for competing projects. The VCA review process can also be influenced by negative actors.
 
Impact
Due to the large volume of proposals it is unrealistic to expect voters to fully absorb every proposal. Some voters are therefore resorting to the CA reviews for guidance on which proposals to vote for.
This was highlighted by a Japanese community member, who surveyed the Japanese community's participation in Catalyst. Of those that voted, a large number indicated that they didn't understand the proposals well enough to make an informed decision, so followed the CA ratings when voting.
 
Competition can cause unreasonable reviews which leads to uninformed voters and a less optimised ROI.
 
Review Quality
While verifying every Community Advisor is not scalable, the use of VCAs to assess the quality of CA reviews is on the surface a good idea. However due to the technical nature of some proposals, it is important that VCAs are able to understand the proposal and its reviews to properly assess their quality. As VCAs are being paid to quality check reviews, this capability is important for the Cardano community to get value for money.
 
Potential Solution
To ensure that bad actors do not infiltrate the VCA ranks, the purpose of this proposal is to indicate the community's request for the Catalyst team to perform identity verification checks of VCAs to ensure they are not assessing CA reviews where there is a conflict of interest (e.g. the proposal is in competition with another project they are aligned with).
Further, VCA experience should be collected and documented to ensure they have the ability to assess technical proposals and their reviews. If someone challenges the ability for a VCA to properly QA a proposal or review, then this documentation can be referred to. If VCAs know that their ability to properly assess proposal reviews is open to dispute, they will be more inclined to only assess those they are able to.
While this may initially fall to the Catalyst team to oversee, as Catalyst becomes more decentralised, a VCA identity verification and technical review process can be outsourced to community elected organisations.

TL:DR: These scripts are a vital part of the system as it currently operates. We have built them to help take some of the manual load off IOG staff. They take time and resources to develop and maintain and we would like the community to support their continued development.
Detailed Explanation:
In the Project Catalyst process there is a phase (Quality Assurance Stage) that allows Proposers and VCAs to review the ratings and assessments done by the Community Advisors.
The assessments are evaluated using the criteria defined in the Red & Yellow card document (link here).
A Community Advisor could get a ""yellow card"", which will cause the exclusion of the specific assessment, a ""red card"", which will exclude all his assessments or positive ""Constructive Feedback"", reserved for assessments that comply with the guidelines and add value to the process.
Here is an overview of the process:

After the Community Advisors submission, the proposers have some days to report the assessments that they consider unfair or out of the guidelines, adding a rationale to their report, or to highlight assessments with ""Constructive Feedback"".
vCAs receive a master file that includes all the proposers' reports and have some day to flag assessments out of guidelines, fair, or with ""Constructive Feedback"".
The vCAs reports are aggregated and an algorithm is run to determine consensus on a decision for each specific assessment (at the moment 4 vCAs have to be involved in the decision and more than 50% of vCAs have to agree on a specific infringement criteria).
Yellow and Red cards are assigned to Community Advisors and invalid assessments are excluded.

This process is currently possible thanks to the implementation of the QA scripts, run by the IOG team, that create Master Files for each stage, validate inputs, calculate the consensus and produce the results used for the final ratings. It's a technical but it's very important to the current operation of the system.
The current implementation (used in Fund 5) consists in 4 scripts:

Create Proposer Document
Based on the IdeaScale export is created a Google Sheet document with all the criteria defined in the R&Y card document. Proposers use this document to report assessments.
Blank assessments are automatically marked.
Create VCA Master File
Based on the output of the Proposer Document, a vCA Master File is created. It includes all the criteria defined in the R&Y card document and the new column ""Proposer mark"" which indicates if proposers reported specific assessments.
The first rule of red card assignment is executed in this script: it counts the percentage of blank assessments made by every single CA and assigns a red card if the defined threshold is reached, excluding all his assessments.
vCAs have to make a copy of this file and review the assessments.
The output produced by this script is totally compatible with the vCA tool (included in Community Tools proposal funded in F5), offering to vCA a more user friendly way to interact with this process.
Create Similarity
This script compares all the assessments to each other and assigns a similarity score for each combination. The output of this file can be used by vCA to identify bad actors and copy-pasted assessments.
Create VCA Aggregate
All the single files produced by vCAs are aggregated in this script, and the consensus rule is executed for every assessment, assigning yellow and red cards to CAs.
This script produces the final valid assessments list that are used to calculate the final ratings.

New features that will come in Fund 5:

Use the same mechanism currently used by vCAs (create a Master File, allow vCA to create a copy and submit it to IOG) will be implemented also for Proposers, avoiding working on a single shared Google sheet. This will allow the release of the qa-proposer tool, which will offer a more user-friendly way for proposers to interact with this stage.
This implementation will also give more control to IOG to check that proposers flag only the assessments of their own proposals.
Adapt the scripts for the new rewarding model for CAs.
A full update to the criteria used by vCA to classify CA reviews in Excellent / Good / Not Valid and to the consensus mechanism.

 
Part of this proposal is an experiment in funding already implemented value add. The funds requested for this proposal will cover the current implementation (the scripts that have been in use since Fund 4) as well as be used to maintain and adapt the scripts as changes are introduced into the Catalyst QA process until the end of 2021 (Fund 7 included).
Technical Specs
The scripts are written in Python and they use Pandas Dataframe framework to interact with the original IdeaScale export (provided by IOG as CSV). They are released as open source code on Github (https://github.com/coire1/catalyst-review-of-reviews-tools).
They also interact with the Google Docs API to publish the output as Google Sheets with some styling to improve the sheet UI.
Experience
Developer with 9+ years of experience (mainly focused on web/mobile. Languages and frameworks: PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Python, Ruby - Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, Angular.js, Vue.js, Node.js). CA and vCA, co-creator of the Community Tools (Proposer/CA/vCA/Voter Tools).

Voting on how Catalyst spends the treasury creates long-term value to ADA, but with so many proposals, with so many new concepts, how do we make any voting decision? Now imagine how difficult it must be when you do not speak English. All Ada holders benefit if we develop better more inclusive and diverse governance processes and strategies. Unless the Catalyst Community and Ada holders level up our collective cognition, a random voting strategy is just as valid as a well researched one.
PLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE
Current Problems and Limitation
Language differences and cultural exclusivity prevents governance initiatives from scaling globally. The constant experimentation of Catalyst means we need to be mindful to include different languages and cultures. Avoiding one culture dominating the narrative.
Misaligned incentives, scams and information overload prevent Ada holders from voting. In Asia and other non-native English speaking cultures, language barriers compound this. Language barriers are evident at every Catalyst stage. Survey results showed in the Japanese community biggest problem of Catalyst voting was the lack of Japanese support (45.61%). Over %37 of respondents highlighted issues with understanding the process- ""I didn't understand the meaning because it was in English, so I voted randomly"". The weariness of scams and lack of trust between proposals and voters were highlighted too. Another %16 mentioned incentive misalignment issues. 
The Team
A collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:
Yuta Yuta @yutazz - Japan: Cardano official ambassador, Community Co-Organiser, Catalyst Fund 2 Recipient, certified public accountant.
Yan Tirta @yantirta - Indonesia: Cardano Indonesia community wrangler empowering his local community with education and encouragement.
Mie Tran @mie.tran.0407 - Vietnam: English and International Business major with experience working with western businesses and translation.
Andy Sibuea @zicozibu - Indonesia: Leading blockchain education beyond cryptocurrencies and across Indonesia.
Tim O'Brien @tobrien - Vietnam: No-code pioneer. Facilitator in East African Townhall (EATH).
Greg Bell @grebel - Australia: IT consultant, writing Catalyst Challenges.
Seomon Blub @seomon - Austria: IT consultant focused on the people-ware infrastructure for sustainable communities.
Robert O'Brien @wolstaeb - New Zealand: Financial systems Software Engineer, Community Co-Organiser and Entrepreneur.
Stephen Whitenstall @swhitenstall - England: Tracks and documents Catalyst. Helping communities like Catalyst Circle and Catalyst Swarm organise.
Felix Weber @felixweber - France: Community Manager building bridges between people. Member of the T&M Catalyst Circle/Swarm/School.
The team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall trusted seed. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm and other community groups across Asia. 
Our solution: Eastern Townhall Forum
Our goal is to establish a process, format, and event stage for voter and proposer onboarding. To bring voters, proposers, and proposals closer together. To establish trust between them. The focus is on six mutually reinforcing areas:

Content production: Help Ada holders understanding why it is important to vote on proposals.
Eastern Hemisphere Language-specific events focused on voter education and discussion.
A proposal language translation pipeline to help proposers reach the wider East Asian community.
Language-specific Catalyst Swarm Ideafests as a stage for building voter awareness, engagement, and trust.
Social Media Marketing: socialise voter content and messaging across our social media channels; and
Conduct routine surveys and user research to help understand individual attitudes to Catalyst and proposal formats.

The proposal is seeking funds to help develop a programme specifically designed to help connect voters with proposals and proposers.
Together these activities form a programme we call the Eastern Townhall Forum. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more. We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, educating, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.
The Eastern Townhall trusted seed are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Listening and engaging with members of the community. Sharing what we learn. For instance Yuta Yuta recently completed one of his many surveys of the Japanese community[1] that this proposal draws upon. We want to do more of this across all the communities. We would like to help improve the user experience for voters. Feeding our collective insights back into Project Catalyst.
Help us improve decision making across the Eastern Hemisphere by making Catalyst voting more accessible.
What Success Looks Like
Participation in Eastern Townhall events has increased and maintains the vibrancy of the new and regular community members. More Catalyst proposers engage with the Asian community. Even if that is just translation of proposals, content, or DApps for the Asian markets. Additionally, Asian proposers find their crowd. They are able to be funded because there is a strong body of Asian voters participating in Catalyst. Survey results show an increase in voter engagement with proposers, the Catalyst process, and deliberations before voting.
Key Performance Indicators
Our primary tool for measuring performance is our voter survey. We will conduct these on a regular basis across Asian countries. Based on the surveys during and after a fund we expect to:

Increase Asian voter participation by 30% from the previous funds.
Increase Asian participation in Catalyst by 20% from the previous fund.
Uncertainty around Catalyst and voting decreases 25% from the previous fund.

The Eastern Townhall Meetup is our primary stage where Ada holders and people interested in Cardano can come and meet community members. Through that platform and social media, people learn and feel comfortable going further. Therefore key engagement metrics indicate our success in bridging voters and proposers together:

The Easter Townhall meetup average weekly numbers increase 25% for each Fund.
Catalyst Proposals available in four languages (ID, JP, KR, VN) increase 50% for each fund.
Eastern Townhall Social Media accounts increase followers by 1000 new followers in six months.

After One Month:

Completed our first pan-Asia voter survey across four Asian countries (ID, JP, KR, VN)
Language-Specific events – Voter Education & Catalyst Swarm

After Three Months:

Produced our Voter Education videos
Translated Catalyst voter materials in four Asain languages (ID, JP, KR, VN)
Held the first formal language specific Eastern Townhall - Catalyst Swarm IdeaFests. (A test run for Fund 6 is being done to find our feet).

After Six Months:

Completed six voter surveys across four Asian countries (ID, JP, KR, VN)
Completed a retrospective on our activities.

After Twelve Months:

We have incorporated the content and practices need to engage with Asian voters and proposers.
Our monthly surveys continue and show forward momentum.
Our content continues to engage members of the community
We have translated our content and Catalyst material to more languages across Asia.

The voter-tool (https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/) was developed as an experiment in pre-funding development by three active Community Advisors: Lucio, Victor and Phil.
After developing the Community Tools for Fund 5, a set of tools aimed at CAs, vCAs and Proposers to facilitate the Assess / QA process (successfully funded in the same fund), we focused on something that could facilitate and improve the voting experience in Catalyst beyond Ideas Scale and the official Voter App.
During the previous funds the need emerged for the voters to have a more user-friendly interface to explore the various proposals in a given fund in a user friendly way. We wanted to provide access to detailed information not present in the official Catalyst Voting App (like the rationale behind each Community Advisor's reviews) and a mechanism to keep track of the voting choices.
For this reason the tool was developed and released to the public for Fund 4 and further developed and widely used in Fund 5.
A total of approximately 3000 unique visitors have visited the tool over these two voting periods.
The proposal will cover the development of the tool, the maintenance of the current features and the update of the data for the next funds until the end of 2021 (F7 included).

Team
Lucio Baglione: Developer with 9+ years of experience (mainly focused on web/mobile. Languages and frameworks: PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Python, Ruby - Laravel, Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, Angular.js, Vue.js, Node.js). CA and vCA, co-creator of the Community Tools (Proposer/CA/vCA/Voter Tools).
Victor Corcino: Veteran Community Advisor (vCA), Proposal Mentor, CAs' elected representative for the 1st Catalyst Circle, co-creator of the Community Tools (Proposer/CA/vCA/Voter Tools), Catalyst Swarm core member, engineering/science/developer and 'hands-on' teaching background.
Phil: Veteran Community Advisor (vCA), co-creator of the Community Tools (Proposer/CA/vCA/Voter Tools and Community Landing page), front end UI/UX designer and finance and business background.
Technical Specs
The main part of the Voter Tool is a SPA (Single Page Application) based on the JavaScript framework Vue.js and published as a static website using Github Pages.
A side series of tools, written in python, were developed to parse and transform IdeaScale exports, Community Advisors and QA process outputs into a unique format to be consumed by the Voter Tool.
The outputs from these tools, that basically include all the Catalyst Information for each specific fund, are published as JSONs in the voter tool repository.
The Vote Pick List feature relies on browsers' LocalStorage function to save the voting choices locally in the user's browser.
The second part of the tool consists in an REST API developed in Laravel to store and serve the Vote Pick lists shared by the users.

Reimagining Decentralized Voting
---------Thesis---------
The theory of one person, one vote or delegation of vote to a trusted surrogate is fairly new on the world stage. Although it has managed to draw in a greater diversity of voter and greater representation of the voting block, it has not proven itself to be the most efficient in evolving complex systems.
According to available literature, concepts around building and maintaining decentralized distributed  systems or spontaneous order systems go back over a thousand years.  Since that time there have been many attempts from governing bodies to engineer evolutionary, optimized social and economic regimes.  
Several new ways of thinking about maximizing self-organized systems have been explored offering a catalogue of theses to tests.  Decentralized DLT systems and game theoretic incentives can be used to evaluate the viability of stigmergic, spontaneous order, and human archetypal decision making mechanisms thereby exposing the tradeoffs between the various systems and illuminating use cases for each.
 
---------The Solution---------
With the funds requested from the community in F6, I would like to author a set of opensource voting designs.  These designs can be applied to collective collaboration flows on the Cardano Blockchain.  The greater hope to be realized over the next two funding rounds is to develop opensource voting primitives that can then be used in Catalyst and Cardano Dapp decision making streams.
 
---------Impact---------
---------Feasibility---------
---------Auditability---------
 
 
Solutions
 - Explore stigmergic systems and their potential to improve decision making in Cardano.
 - Identify multiple systems and extrapolate out their potential for sustainable governance in blockchain networks
 - Produce a whitepaper documenting the findings
Consequences
 - A richer understanding of how decentralized, distributed ecosystems can evolve through modeling natural stigmergic systems.
 - Examples of how stigmergic systems can be used to manage and maintain decentralized, distributed systems

AIM Community Tools
The AIM Community Tools were first developed and used in Funds 4 and 5, and our first proposal was funded in Fund 5 ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350981-48088 ). These tools were created to facilitate the process to the different Catalyst roles: Proposers, Community Advisors and Veteran Community Advisors, as further explained below.
 
Catalyst Assessment and Review Phases Overview
In the current Catalyst process, after proposals are finalized, there are three phases that make up the assess and QA processes before community voting:

Community Advisors (CAs) assess the proposals and give them a rating between 1 and 5 in three categories: Impact, Feasibility and Auditability, along with a rationale explaining each rating given;
Proposers review the CAs assessments, when they are able to flag low quality/unfair assessments to be checked by the Veteran Community Advisors (vCAs).
vCAs review assessments of proposals, using those flagged by the Proposers in the previous phase as a potential starting point.

 
Previous problems that the Community Tools are helping to solve
Previously, during the assessment phase, CAs had to navigate through IdeaScale website and search for proposals to access. In order to better distribute the assessments between proposals, CAs had to manually search for the least assessed proposals, which was inefficient, tiring and time consuming. During Fund4, to assist with this task, a document was created by IOG indicating the proposals that were missing a minimum number of CA reviews.
The assessments' review done by both Proposers and vCAs was performed using an Excel sheet, which was functional to perform the job, but in the case of vCAs reviews, there was no coordination during this phase. This led to an imbalance in the reviews of assessments: some assessments receive lots of reviews, and others receive none.
As seen in Fund4, CAs and vCAs got overloaded with the amount of proposals they needed to assess and assessments to review. Considering the expected exponential increase in Cardano Project Catalyst's size, it is crucial to improve the efficiency of CAs and vCAs work over time.
 
Our solution: AIM Community Tools
To solve these problems, the AIM team has developed three tools:

A CA Tool, to automatically suggest a proposal to be assessed by the CA based and his challenge preference and the least assessed proposals. Link: https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool/#/
A Proposer Tool, to make it easier to go through all the assessments, set them as 'checked' and/or flag them. Under development.
A vCA Tool, to automatically suggest an assessment to be reviewed by the vCA based on his filter choices and the least reviewed assessments. Link: https://cardanocataly.st/vca-tool/#/

These tools aim to make the process of assessment and review easier, and also to improve/create coordination between CAs and vCAs during these phases.
The CA and vCA Tools were already developed and used in Funds 4 and 5, and received very positive feedback from the CAs and vCAs, who mentioned that the tools improved their productivity and made the whole process a lot less tiring.
Since the CAs and vCAs work is paid by Project Catalyst as well, we believe these tools are already increasing the Return on Intention related to these activities.
 
This proposal's goal
The development of the AIM Community Tools was already funded in Fund 5 ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/350981-48088 ). Although, Catalyst is an ever evolving experiment and these tools will need to be updated probably every Fund in order to keep them relevant and bringing value to the process.
As an example, during Fund 6, the IOG Research team presented a new rewarding scheme for CA's assessments, which changed the way that vCAs reviewed these assessments. These changes need to be included in the Community Tools, otherwise they will become outdated and cannot be used anymore.
Therefore, this proposal is a request for funding for updating and maintaining the Community Tools for two more Funds (6 and 7).
 
Technical Specs
The current version of the tools, developed for Fund 5, are three Vue.js SPA (Single Page Application).
CA Tool: the app will be updated with the new data for F6 and F7. The mechanism to keep track of the assessed proposal will be improved with a self-checklist for the CA that will include some guiding questions to help him to better prepare high quality assessments.
Proposer Tool: the initial version developed for Fund 5, was based on the R&Y Card system and all the data structure of the tool included all the criteria mentioned in the document.
In Fund 6, the new system includes different criteria (excellent/good/not valid), and the data structure will be updated according to it.
vCA Tool: the initial version developed for Fund 5, was based on the R&Y Card system and all the data structure of the tool included all the criteria mentioned in the document.
In Fund 6, the new system includes different criteria (excellent/good/not valid), and the data structure will be updated according to it.

Exploratory Data Analysis
In statistics, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ""refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations."" ( https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15 ). 
A EDA gives an overview of the main characteristics of the analyzed data and many times it's useful to provide insights, and it is usually the first step in a Data Science analysis, before applying more advanced methods, for e.g., machine learning.
 
The data of Catalyst
Project Catalyst has just completed one year of existence and 5 complete Funds. During this time, lots of data were generated, such as:

Voting results
Proposal data
Community Advisors (CA) assessments
Veteran Community Advisors (vCA) review
Challenges budgets
Voting Power participating in Catalyst
Unique wallets participating in Catalyst

Although all this information is available to the community, it is still not being used to bring value to the process.
 
Catalyst: Exploratory Data Analysis
An EDA for Catalyst can provide many information and insights based on previous Funds, for example:

Influence of CAs Scores in the voting results.
Relation between Score, % of Challenge Budget requested and voting results (proposal funded or not, approved or not).
Statistics of Funded, Not Funded and Not Approved proposals: average score, minimum score of a Funded proposal in each challenge, maximum score of a Not Funded proposal in each challenge, absolute numbers and percentages of Funded, Not Funded and Not Approved proposals.
Number of CAs assessments rated as 'Excellent', 'Good' and 'Filtered Out' by vCAs.
Variance of CAs scores in a single proposal.
Analysis of Voting Power vs Unique Wallets, looking for the influence of whales on the results.
Alternative voting results: ranking by Unique Wallets instead of Voting Power.
Evolution of Catalyst over the time. Numbers of: proposals, active CAs, active vCAs, challenges, voting power, unique wallets.
Many more information and analysis that the community might be interested in.

Some examples of these plots and information can already be seen in the attachments of this proposal.
 
Why submitting this proposal in 'Distributed Decision Making'?
Why is this Challenge important? Because 'high-quality and decentralized decision-making will increase treasury ROI and legitimize decentralized governance.' Also, the leading question of this Challenge is 'How can we help the Catalyst community to get better at distributed decision making within the next two Catalyst rounds?' ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26104 )
This proposals aims to provide a better understanding of how Catalyst works through information such as what are the weak point, what could be improved and what proposers should aim for in order to have higher chances of being funded. All this information and many more generated via the proposed EDA analysis will increase significantly the evolution of Catalyst and strengthen the this Distributed Decision Making process in the Cardano ecosystem.
 
Deliverables and Milestones
After funded, I will provide EDA Reports for 4 Funds (Funds 4 to 7). These Reports will include the topics mentioned above, and more information and analysis that the community might be interested in. Not only the plots will be included, but also a comprehensive explanation and discussion on the analysis results will be provided.
In alignment with the Challenge goal to support the Distributed Decision Making in the next two Catalyst rounds, the analysis of Funds 6 and 7 will support the process during Funds 7 and 8, respectively. Also, recent data of Funds 4 and 5 will help to understand the evolution of Catalyst process and to support the analysis of current state.
EDA Reports will be delivered at the end of the following Funds (dates may change according to Catalyst schedule):

Reports analyzing Funds 4, 5 and 6: 2021 Q4
Report analyzing Fund 7: 2022 Q1

 Therefore:

After 3 months: 3 EDA reports delivered to the community.
After 6 months: 4 EDA reports delivered to the community.

 
Data Sharing
The raw and treated data, as well as the JupyterLab Notebooks used to generate the charts and plots, will be shared with the community through a open repository in GitHub.
Also, a partnership with the Community Landing Page ( http://cardanocataly.st/ ) might occur in order to create interactive versions of the charts presented in the EDA reports generated through this proposal.
 
My Background and Experience
I joined Catalyst during Fund 3, when I was a CA for the first time and since then. Also, I'm a vCA since Fund 4. I actively contributed to the project also by support the creation of community guidelines, as a Proposal Mentor, and more recently as the CAs representative in the 1st Catalyst Circle ( https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/08/introducing-the-catalyst-circle ). I know many aspects of Project Catalyst and I can communicate with the community in order to maximize the Return on Intention of this proposal.
Regarding my academic background, I've got a BSc. in Chemical Engineering, a MSc. in Chemical Engineering and Software Development, and a specialization in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Also, I'm currently a PhD candidate researching the field of Machine Learning applied to Fluid Dynamics.

Catalyst Interactive News Journal (CINJ)
 
Newspapers and journals typically work from top to bottom, from writers and editors to readers. The publisher decides which articles should be read by the public. The printed stories are often hard to prove and trust––the information is diluted with words that sell––sources are often scarcely available. Stories from the grassroots that could share their learning and wisdom from their unique position, all the way to the top, are not acknowledged. Because of this, readers are told what to consume without an opportunity to contribute in a meaningful way to their informational environment, even as they are the ones who live, experience, and see with their own eyes the world around them up close and first-hand.
Our proposal aims to explore alternatives––possibilities that give the readers the choice of how much they would like to participate in what they are reading––with a format that seeks to start small, evolve, and increase over time. We will focus on ""out of the ordinary protocols,"" putting in place easily repeatable mechanisms that are agile: adjusted and adapted as needed, the overall design focuses on a flexible and dynamic design and evolution.
Most important is that over time, the readers are empowered to become voters, writers, and perhaps, if the community decides, they will also edit and perhaps build video pieces out of the stories later on that can improve and enhance the experience for all. This helps to blur the lines between the top and the bottom so that this truly becomes an effort of distributed decision-making.
Design.
The design of CINJ will be based on an interactive website. The community itself can submit content like articles, documentation, or videos. Site users can vote on submitted content to decide which stories or articles should appreciate a continuation.
The Journey of an article by Voting.
The process is quite simple. Submitted articles will start in the Backlog (A.1). The highest voted articles in the Backlog will be published as short stories (A.2). The highest Voted short stories will become Brief Stories (A.3). The highest voted brief stories will become main stories (A.4) and so on…. As submitted short stories may need support in being edited on their journey, the CINJ Team will support submitters in editing their articles to ensure that the voters receive high-quality stories and articles.

In this news journal, everyone will be allowed to submit their articles. All submitted articles will be visible to everyone in a news journal backlog. The submitted articles in the backlog will pass through a voting round. In this first round, the voters decide which backlog stories will be published on the news journal website. The submitted article's journey on the site will pass through the following categories.
Categories.
(A.1) Backlog ( Character limit = 1000 Characters )
(A.2) Published as short stories ( Character limit = 1000 Characters )
(A.3) Published as Brief stories ( Character limit = 2500 Characters )
(A.4) Published as main stories ( Character limit = unlimited Characters )
(A.5) Published as Movies/Reportage ( Character limit = unlimited Characters & playtime )
(A.6) Archive of highest voted stories ( Character limit = unlimited Characters )
(A.1) Contains max 30 articles per epoch
(A.2) to (A.4) contains max. 10 articles per category
(A.5) Contains max 1 Movie per month
(A.6) will not have any contain limits as it serves as Archive.
 
(B) The Journey of an article by Voting.
The process is quite simple. Submitted articles will start in the Backlog (A.1). The highest voted articles in the Backlog will be published as short stories (A.2). The highest Voted short stories will become Brief Stories (A.3). The highest voted brief stories will become main stories (A.4) and so on…. As submitted short stories may need support in being edited on their journey, the CINJ Team will support the submitters in evolving the articles over iterations to ensure that the voters receive high-quality stories and articles.
(B.1) Voting on submitted stories in the backlog
(B.2) Voting on short stories
(B.3) Voting on brief stories
(B.4) Voting on main stories
 
In the beginning, the website will be set up on WordPress, where several already existing voting plugins are available. Over time the goal is to bring the news journal voting process on-chain.
 
(C) Criterias - Transparently Verified information & content
All submitted articles have to fulfill several criteria as we want to make sure that submitted content follows a trackable, accountable and transparent process.
(C.1) Each submitter has to submit their articles via the CINJ git
(C.2) Each submitter has to link direct sources to verify submitted content
(C.3) Each submitter needs to hold a Daedalus, Yoroi, or other ADA based Wallet
 
(E) CINJ Voting Epochs/Cycles
The Epoch of a voting process lasts 5 days. This timeframe is chosen as Stake Pools operate in the same timeframe, and we definitely aim to set up a CINJ Stakepool in the future. Getting used to this time cycle allows us to adjust reward distribution by a matching timeframe to Stakepools. Rewards can be easily distributed.
 
Epoch duration
(E.1) voting on (A.1) last 5 days
(E.2) voting on (A.2) last 5 days
(E.3) voting on (A.3) last 10 days
(E.4) voting on (A.4) last 10 days
The described voting process is a first mature draft and will be adjusted and evolved over time and earned experience.
 
(I) Incentives for submitters - the CINJ Treasury & Rewards
As we want to reward the community for their engagement by submitting articles to edit and add content on the article's journey, CINJ aims to establish its own treasury from which engaged submitters will receive rewards.
The treasury will be located on a Yoroi Wallet, the wallet's balance will be public and transparent. Everyone can see how much ADA the treasury is holding at any moment, as the balance will be shown on the CINJ website.
As we want to start small, the incentives for submitting articles might be quite low but will definitely rise over time if the treasury allows.
(I.1) Submitters receive 5 USD when their submitted articles in (A.1) are voted to be (A.2)
(I.2) Submitters receive 10 USD when their submitted articles in (A.2) are voted to be (A.3)
(I.3) Submitters receive 15 USD when their submitted articles in (A.3) are voted to be (A.4)
(I.4) Submitters receive 25 USD when their submitted articles in (A.4) are voted to be (A.5)
 
Rewards per Epoch ( available )
10 Articles from (A.1) to (A.2) = 50 USD
10 Articles from (A.2) to (A.3) = 100 USD
10 Articles from (A.3) to (A.4) = 150 USD
10 Articles from (A.4) to (A.5) = 250 USD
total = 550 USD
Rewards per Month
total = 3300 USD (6*550)
Rewards for 3 Months ( 1 Catalyst Funding round )
total = 9900 USD (3*3300)
All rewards will be distributed in ADA
For future Catalyst Funding rounds, we definitely aim to include an NFT Business model and own tokens for the CINJ if the project leads to a successful project and requires a more complex rewarding system.
 
Logo NFT Competition: 
Be part of history in the making - Create an NFT logo for the Interactive Catalyst News Journal (CINJ)
With the current CINJ Logo/Profile image as a temporary one, we will launch a competition allowing the global Cardano community of creatives to submit their ideas for a logo that captures the imagination, vision, and mission of CINJ.
Entries would be free of charge and require sign-up on the website (1 entry per wallet address). The submission would have to be sent as an NFT and meet certain pixel dimensions for optimum usage across platforms.
Submissions will be accepted within a time window (First month of Fund 7), with the community voting for their favorite ones!
Using smart contracts, the prize funds of $1000 worth of ADA will be sent to the wallet that submitted the NFT and received the most community votes by the deadline!
 
Impact.
The impact of this project is definitively defined as the design of the first distributed news journal on Earth, which is built in a way hoped to create a certain influence on the journalistic environment of the future. In other words, the impact is seen as we eventually use the Cardano Blockchain and ecosystem as the platform for the Renaissance of the Newspaper; in this way, revolution is defined as a new transparent, trackable and measurable impact itself.
Feasibility.
This proposal is quite easy to realize as the design is based on already existing off-chain applications & plugins (WordPress, GitHub). The growing Team is committed to steering this proposal through its evolution successfully.
The rewarding model is easy to realize as ADA Wallets are available, and the distribution of rewards can be made manually in the beginning by the CINJ Team.
Auditability.
As the news journal will be designed on a website, the achievements and evolution can be constantly tracked and documented. We offer as well to provide a bi-weekly breakout room in the Catalyst After Town Halls to allow the community to interact directly with the team.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revisiting the Problem Statement
One of the main reasons distributed organisations or cooperatives cannot transition to a sustainable reward system is the lack of a trusted & working mechanism to track, to attribute value and to successively reward contributions of individuals.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Experimental Solution
To develop an open-source attribution, valuation & reward system - we are going to set up, configure and test a SourceCred instance in parallel with a contribution survey. We will also prepare guidance materials to onboard new users and document the results of the experiment.
SecretDecks will use

GitHub to track task items, to create written content, to maintain a wiki (Gitbook), to record ideas and meeting minutes.

 

Discord for informal and formal communication

 
SourceCred instance
We will setup a SourceCred instance to aggregate data from GitHub & Discord. SourceCred is a tool for communities to measure and reward value creation (https://sourcecred.io/).
Using SourceCred we will distribute ""Can-D"" (a community currency) according to the amount of positive or negative contributions or reactions each individual member has impacted within the community.
This proposal will trial how and for what ""Can-D"" can be exchanged or redeemed in the future.
A parallel Contribution Survey
In parallel to the SourceCred instance SecretDecks maintain a manual process for core members to attribute value to their work via a monthly ""Contribution Survey"" (Example : https://github.com/SecretDecks/Documentation/issues/43).
Each survey will be validated & reviewed by two other team members for final approval.
Test runs
SecretDecks will conduct test runs for 4 weeks over December 2021 and January 2021.
Core contributors will be rewarded first and the remaining ADA will be distributed evenly to everyone that has enough ""Can-D"".
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Off to On-Chain Self Governance"" proposal
This proposal will inform and provide support materials for SecretDecks ""Off to On-Chain Self Governance"" proposal.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Problem Statement - Extension:
Governance and decision making are made mainly by two methods: discussion and voting. This is why the institute where nation-states representatives gather and decisions are getting made is called - ""parliament"": The place to ""parle"" - to speak, to talk, to discuss. Discussions allow the participants to express different opinions and perspectives and to take into consideration the pros and cons, the benefits and the risks before decisions are made.
But discussions are not scalable. Discussions create noise, and when there is too much noise it is hard to identify the signal, i.e. the data that is relevant and contributes to the process. This is why only a small group of a few hundred people, at most, can take an active part in parliaments, and the other millions of people can only delegate their voice by voting.
In the Catalyst project, the governance is being made by voting on proposals on-chain. Problems/needs are often identified by community-wide discussion. Solutions often are not. The focus on proposals leaves outside wider policy challenges that are relevant to the community, such as process guidelines, community code of conduct, monetary policy etc. Discussions on issues regarding the future of Cardano and Catalyst are disconnected from the voting process and spread around on different platforms: ideascale, google-docs, telegram, discord, reddit and others.
This situation makes the decision-making process ineffective and creates a risk of getting decisions that are not in the best interest of the community and its members. Also, it may discourage many members from taking an active part in the process.
Our Solution:
Consenz is a platform that was created to address those problems and offer a proven solution.
The discussion in Consenz is different from other platforms in a few aspects:

Instead of an endless and chaotic thread of comments, there is a focus and a product to the process: A document that can be discussed and edited by the participants and reflect their agreements.
There is a clear structure to the content: comments are attributed to a specific section and function as arguments for or against it; sections are attributed to a specific topic; topics are attributed to the document.
There is a voting system that allows the users to express their opinion without adding more noise to the discussion.
The voting system also creates a method to deal with conflicts and determine which opinion has the majority of participants' agreements.
Those agreements are separated from the noise by a simple algorithm that determines which section received enough support and can be added to the document automatically.

See the demo: https://app.consenz.co.il/document/catalyst-demo/welcome
This is how the discussion in Consenz works (see also the diagram attached):


The discussion can begin with an existing draft or on a blank page.   


Users can publish new section suggestions to the document topics. 


For every section or section suggestion, users can suggest improvements by editing the section text.  


Every new section suggestion or improvement suggestion stands for discussion and for a vote:
4.1 Users can comment on the section, or comment on other users' comments.
4.2 Users can vote ""for"" or ""against"" the section suggestion.   


When the sum of ""for"" votes minus the ""against"" votes reaches a predetermined threshold, the suggestion changes status from ""in a vote"" to ""approved"".
5.1 New approved section suggestions are added to the document automatically.
5.2 Newly approved Improvement suggestion replaces the existing section.    


Every time that the document is changed (i.e. a new section or an improvement suggestion is approved) The approving threshold for new and existing suggestions is updated according to those parameters:
6.1 The number of participants in the process at the time of the change.
6.2 The consensus that the current draft has reached so far, i.e. the for/against votes ratio of the approved sections.
6.3 This calculation is made by the ""consensus meter"" algorithm.  


 
 The Project Status
Since 2018 we have been building a prototype of Consenz (until lately it was available only in Hebrew) and in 2020-2021 we have completed a proof-of-concept phase. The app prototype has been used by diverse groups for different purposes in Israel, among them:

Schools' teams used Consenz to create teaching guidelines during the covid19 restrictions.
Protest movements used Consenz to create demands lists.
Environmental organizations used it to collaborate with government and municipality workers to create plans for dealing with the climate crisis.

Now we wish to configure the platform to the Catalyst and Cardano community needs and processes, and ultimately expand to serve all sorts of DAO's in the crypto ecosystem.
In order to do that, we plan to:

Implement a new UX/UI design based on the lessons and experience that we have collected during the proof-of-concept phase
Add a gamification layer on top of the existing user interface
Add a delegation layer on top of the existing user interface, that can be used for reputation representation as well
Create infrastructure for future integration of the platform voting mechanism to the Cardano blockchain smart contracts for high security, immutability and transparency.
Open the code by adding proper documentation and improving accessibility for new developers, and invite the developers' community to take part in building and improving the platform.
Reaching out to other initiatives that are working to improve decision making processes in the Catalyst community for potential collaboration.

Key Metrics to measure
Quality success metrics will be measured by the use of the products that will be created by the Consenz platform, i.e. the documents that will be discussed and created by the community. We wish to see during the first 3 months after a launch of the MVP at least 5 documents that will be used as guidelines, policy shapers and other purposes that answer the Catalyst community needs.
Quantity success metrics will be compared to the overall community participation in the current governance process of project Catalyst, i.e., the number of wallet addresses that cast votes using the official voting app. The metrics will consider exposure (unique user traffic according to google analytics) and onboarding registered users on Consenz.
For Fund8:

Exposure to 15% of voters
Onboarding 5% of voters 

For Fund9:

Exposure to 25% of voters
Onboarding 7% of voters

Intro
The number of proposals as well as their complexity is growing fast and it's becoming harder and more time consuming to vote on a proposal's merit and and one's personal interests. While reviewers do give ""star"" ratings, that help with quickly judging the overall quality of a proposal, a vote - especially when it's going more in the direction of governance - is always also a choice of personal preference and between trade-offs.
See a summary in this presentation: [ https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k7ggfI_sIO_A6N9ogUbHS2h3IlP2c1vxMXvJbCIixMU/ ]
Competing Interests and Trade-offs
Let's look at an example: While one user might be interested in proposals that are all about NFTs and Gaming, another user might be much more interested in API development. I think we can find a small number of such ""competing interest descriptors"" that can capture a good portion of the diversity of interest of voters in an easy format.
Following the example above we could call this ""competing interest descriptor"" the Entertainment descriptor. It has, for example, a range from -10 (boring) over 0 (neutral) to +10 (entertaining). It would be only a small overhead for reviewers to rate every proposal based on such a descriptor, similar to the current star-rating. In essence a tag with a numerical value.
 A number of different such ""competing interest descriptors"" come to mind: Whale-friendliness, Adoption-orientation, Local-Global, Scientific, DeFi*-oriented*... Now, I'm fully aware that such simple words don't capture the full depth and would provide ample space for differing interpretation and also the choice of number and quality of these descriptors itself is something that should be done carefully, which is why I think this should be a fluid community process, where community members can propose and improve descriptors and vote on their usefulness (which may change over time, as Cardano matures).
For example behind each of these descriptors there should be rationale, why it was chosen, what the extreme opposite ends of it represent, with examples etc. It is important the this representation is well balanced, with clearly laid out trade-offs. I imagine that each descriptor eventually becomes enriched with links, calculations  etc. that allows users to find their own position based on solid, objective information and to engage with others in constructive dialog about advantages and disadvantages of various positions.
Rather than compartmentalizing, this should allow users to orient their opinion in relation to others. For example an NFT/Art descriptor could make an argument that in the entire blockchain industry XX% of trades are for NFTs while it's less on Cardano, so this should be strengthened. The counterargument could be, that a solid base protocol without specialization will attract this automatically, so a special emphasis is not necessary.
 
Immediate Usefulness - Smart Voting
So what's in it for the voter? Let's assume this set of descriptors exists and we have, say 5 that do a reasonably good job to describe every individual proposal. Now all a voter has to do, is to locate his personal interests on these 5 dimensions to get an automated voting list, ranked by alignment with his interests right down to those that are opposed to his interests. 
So answering literally 5 statements with ""disagree""-""fully agree"" or dragging 5 sliders on a web interface (maybe complemented with filtering options) could give a user his personal voting lists in seconds. This would not diminish the voter's ability to dig deeper of course, or make different choices etc. 
(If voters have records of their voting history, this could also work the other way round - bases on past choices, the voters' personal interest descriptors could easily be calculated.)
 
Incentives & Business Model
While I see this more as a community driven effort, a well kept webpage, the data recording backend, moderation etc. will need a sustainable financing model. One way to achieve this, could be this model: via dApp integration users could earn a token or small amounts of ada by providing data for the system (descriptors for ideas for example). On the flip side, some advanced functionality (e.g. proposal ranking with more complex algorithms) could cost a small amount of the token or ada - maybe in the price range of the voting rewards. Balancing these for a small gain, could generate the income for keeping the system running long time. 
 So basically: Someone who puts information into the system (CAs, community members, ...) gets rewards, someone who uses that information (voter using an algorithm, interest groups looking for information about voter opinions, ...) pays for it. (In the case of voters maybe about as much as the voting rewards)
 
Roadmap, Costs, Stage-Gate etc
For the scope of this funding round I only do ask for initiation costs to follow up on the ideas presented here. That includes engaging with CAs and vCAs, finding scientists who published about VAAs (Voting Advice Applications) to map their experience into DAO scope, maybe commissioning a short report, estimate back- and frontend costs and to find a group of people wanting to start this - respectively integrating with one or more of the groups also working on Cardano Distributed decision making.
I'm fully aware that this might seem to be too much on the edge between idea and project, still, you got to start somewhere and winning a small funding, would go a long way to motivate to pursue this in earnest. I also do not see this as a business opportunity as such, that justifies personal investment (of time and other resources) but as the start of community effort for a new way to govern a system.
Weeks 4-6: Scout for team to support this ideas. For this I'd liase with CAs, vCAs but look around in genereal to find Cardanians with a skill set around back/front end programming, survey and data-science specialists and maybe marketing. In parallel work with other teams of this and previous funds and map out how and if it makes sense to integrate (for example: keep a separate webpage vs. integrating with an existing group) to maximize impact.
Weeks 6-10: Put together a plan with the team to outline all elements necessary to put things into practice. This includes cost and time estimations of database backend, frontend programming, server requirements, security measures, marketing costs etc. For some of these parts, payed estimates, or little studies might be necessary - for example to estimate user numbers, storage requirements, design a database scheme etc.
Weeks 10-12: Based on the previous phase and the most promising avenues, put out a fully budgeted and detailed proposal to fund the next stage. The next stage would probably target the functionality of finding and improving Opposing Interest Descriptors only and turn out simply ranked voting lists for individual users. Things like algorithms, DID, user and wallet integration, dApp connections and algorithm would come at a later stage.
The budget I ask is to cover any out-of-hand costs during these 12 weeks. Like buying a domain, little assessments, maybe a logo etc. and generally incentivize the time and effort collaborators (and myself) are investing to build this idea.
 
Looking further (beyond the scope of Fund 6)
It might seem overly complicated to find this descriptors via community choice, maybe on a dedicated homepage, with examples and arguments and information versus just sitting down a committee and churn out a simple list of such descriptors (though at the beginning this might actually be the solution of choice), so why am I proposing this?
Simply because such a mechanism could have much broader usefulness and implications in the future, so that setting up a robust mechanism might be worth the effort.
Imagine hundreds of thousands of voters voting on thousands of proposals (including Catalyst, but maybe also CIP and even Cardano network parameters). Currently Cardano docs say, that in the future, votes may be delegated to experienced and trusted community members who's interests align with one's own (not dissimilar to politicians). My proposal would lay the ground work for something new: algorithmic voting.
(Going a bit technical now, sorry.) The descriptors for anything that is put up for a vote, place this thing in a n-dimensional space. There are algorithms that can cluster such information and calculate the (n-dimensional) distance between the personal set of the 5 descriptors and single ideas or clusters of ideas in this n-dimensional space (see here for example (no affiliation): https://github.com/chriswernst/dbscan-python or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering ). Clusters in this space are nothing but interest groups - basically mathematically emerging parties. So instead of delegating their vote to a ""pool operator politician"" for voting, pool operators could have their very own algorithmic ""Pool Party"" (so to say).
A concrete example again, using the interest descriptors from above: There might be a cluster of ""Gaming & NFT interested in local communities"" or a cluster of ""Developers into DEX and trading"" etc. It is conceivable that such clusters and their operating parameters would allow users to delegate their vote to an on-chain algorithm or consult such an algorithm to assess even highly technical decisions that are put up for voting based on their personal interests. 
From a simple set of descriptors, a complex ecosystem of interest groups, parties and voting could emerge that would allow voters to find their place among competing interests, assess how their personal interests align with voting choices and hopefully also get a better understanding of opposing positions, leading to constructive governance that accurately reflects the interests of all participants.
 
How success looks like
For Fund 6: Found a team of engaged and knowledgeable individuals who want to build this. Have a solid battle plan out to make it happen via the next funding round.
For the next Fund: Have a own or integrated website that allows CAs / users to propose and improve Opposing Interest Descriptors and rate Ideascale Funding Ideas bases on these. Have a system in place that gives users a personalized, ranked voting list based on their interests after answering simple questions.
For the Fund after that: Integrate everything with dApp connection, DID and add algorithmic voting, automated interest group clustering and other advanced functions. Users will be able to connect their wallets and delegate votes to algorithms.
 
Impact
My proposal will make it very easy and fast for voters to vote on hundreds of proposals based on their interests about the blockchain's development direction even if they have little understanding of the individual proposals. It will therefore be able to engage users that would otherwise shun voting due to the perceived effort or their lack of technical understanding. This will result in a much better mapping of voter's interests onto the proposals than otherwise possible. Taking 5 minutes to vote will make many more people vote than needing to invest hours and hours reading through proposals.
It will also enable users to find their position towards future blockchain development amongst all the other interests that are out there, which will make it easier to engage with like minded people by finding interest groups. This will also foster cooperation among opposing interest groups since they can be seen as groups with degrees of difference as opposed to total antagonism. There will be no ""users vs miners"", but voters and interests groups who acknowledge each other's position because they are just differences on a scale. This should allow for more fluid cooperation, bigger engagement and more clear leadership and direction of Cardano's development. 
I think this addresses all the guiding questions of the Campaign Brief. To quote the main point:
The community is consciously improving decision-making processes while growing a group of committed and collaborative leaders.
 
META / Remarks
Thank you for the comments and the many discussions with fellow proposers in this fund! I've amended my proposal accordingly and am happy to announce that already there is communication how my proposal can be tied into other proposals like for example Catalyst Compass ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Compass/367154-48088 ) and Voter Tool - AIM ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Voter-Tool-AIM/368984-48088 ) - both of which have nice synergies with my proposal. Voting for them as well as my proposal will foster adoption and further collaboration of all of these.
 A couple of issues that will have to be dealt with in the future: DID and wallets - what is a voter vs. a staking key - how to prevent manipulation of descriptors. Ensuring the quality of descriptors? Will stable, algorithmic clusters emerge? Can useful definitions be assigned to them outside of their mathematical description?
Not all of these issues can be handled in the scope of a single funding round. I expect a team of data scientists, front- and backend developers and community specialists getting involved eventually to drive this to a larger scale.

Cardano's Government system is the largest decentralized voting system in the world, counting about 250,000 active voters within the Fund5 period (regarding a number of voters from Fund2 period counting 24,000).
The number of active participants is steadily increasing and the system is more and more widely recognized by the community. However, it is becoming apparent that it is too difficult or even impossible for the average voter to make a good selection or even just to get a reasonable overview of all the projects and their potential value - that is where we kick in.
Imagine that someone has already been addressed to the troubles of pre-selection from the incredibly large offer and sorting it. What if someone eligibly analyzed and prepared this selection for all the voters to get insight on a general and above on a deepened level? This would give all users of the Cardano Government system a tool of understanding to select projects which they really want to support and which they really understand through our general and in-depth analysis.
As an independent non-profit organization (which shall be merged with the excisting voting structures by the Catalyst Community Advisors (CA's and vCA's) using an edited incentive system), we stay neutral and follow the philosophy of making the Cardano ecosystem easily accessible to all users and allowing them to participate in the voting system in the best informed way as possible. To achieve this, we use sophisticated evaluation keys arranged in more evaluation categories than before. We also focus particularly on communicating the results of our analyses to users and/or voters as coherently as possible while providing further in-depth information for more advanced users and/or voters.
So, why did we decide to establish a non-profit organization? We are utterly aware of the great responsibility entailed by the growing scope of necessary evaluation and classification of the projects. In our eyes, only a non-profit organization might be in the position to act with the right mindset coping with these tasks on the one hand and on the other to be able to represent the claim of acting on behalf of the entire Cardano ecosystem - without having to represent any own economic interests.
It is one of our principles that every project participating in the Catalyst voting is analyzed carefully, unbiased and fairly.
 
The projects available for voting often require advanced technical knowledge and hence, are not comprehensible for everyone. Project details are limited when using the Catalyst App or further information require to log in to Cardano Ideascale. Unfortunately, the Ideascale website is not easily accessible and not clearly structured. It is hard to keep an overview of all the projects available and more often only those which already received a certain amount of feedback will show up on the first pages. Furthermore, the Ideascale website with all its projects is not clearly structured by subclasses of projects, which would allow for a better access for users and voters because of better categorization. It would be a lot easier to find a preferential project when implementing the division into subclasses and the assignment of the several projects to it.
 
The aim of our ""Catalyst Compass"" project is to provide a more detailed evaluated and categorized overview of the current Catalyst fundraising projects for the people. We want to reform the Catalyst project's assessment system by providing a more in-depth analysis composed of a coherent summary and a broader spectrum of evaluation categories. This means we will make the Catalyst projects accessible and comprehensible for all potential users of the Cardano blockchain and for all the voters of the projects, depending on their level of technical, structural, economic, social, etc. understanding.
Hence, the general project's overview, evaluation and summary are to be followed by an in-depth analysis regarding the individual project's challenges, claims and aims. Being as diverse as all the projects are, we will keep in mind the necessary wide spectrum of potential experts (Community Advisors and evaluating Community Advisors) to competently assess all the aspects of the several projects.
Our moderators (composed of the vCA's) will provide a selection of the most promising projects, after the projects were assessed by the CA's. For this, evaluation keys have to be more detailed, e.g. in form of a classified scale to evaluate the economic, social and perhaps even political benefits, the estimated initial and ongoing costs and others like the already excisting category of feasability. Therefore an own point of view has to be defined concerning the community's attitude torwards decentralization, wealth distribution and who might benefit or suffer from a project's outcome. So, the assessement will have a broader classification and hence, will be more significant.
To stay with the thought of decentralization, the rules of becoming a CA and vCA/moderator will stay the same as they already are so, everyone can register as a CA and will not be excluded, as long as he/she is providing proper assessments according to the rules of assessment as there is.
To implement our ""Catalyst Compass"", we will issue and maintain a standalone website which is intended to be linked to the Catalyst Community and the Cardano-ideascale websites.
 
Our analyses intend to ensure that every participant in the Catalyst voting system is provided with coherent enough explanations and information of his/her preferred projects so that everyone is able to compare the projects with each other and by that, vote for the very project which in his/her eyes deserves it the most.
We aim for an understanding of the several projects, no matter what the educational or technical background of the voters might be, so that everyone can give his/her vote with the highest possible level of awareness.
Therefore, to underline our claim to provide coherent access to the several projects for all participants, we further aim to implement our website as a multilingual platform to reach even more potential prospects. Everyone should have the opportunity to dedicate his/her valuable vote to the project that deserves it. Our general and in-depth analyses and a clear presentation of them with many comparison parameters are key in the process.
 
We as Catalyst Compass offer a web platform which describes and evaluates the different projects for each current fund. The evaluation will be done rolling from fund to fund.
The evaluation methods like the analysis method will be standardized and given to the community advisors.
so that a comparison of the projects will be possible.
The following will be the tasks of Catalyst Compass team:
- Provision, maintenance and upkeep of the website
- Manage / pay staff (moderators / community advisors)
- Create / predefine / analyze and if necessary adapt evaluation methods
 
The members, staff and helpers stay in contact with each other via internet. For collaboration we will use platforms and services like e.g. Discord. This type of networking is completely sufficient for the demands of our work and as a result the acquisition and management of a central office is unnecessary.
 
The staff is composed of about 10-25 moderators who are taken from the pool of vCA's, CA's and/or others. Furthermore, experts will be needed who assess the projects and above that, give a coherent summary of the evaluated project. The experts act much like the already excisting CA's.
The tasks of the moderators is to assign and register the experts (CA's) to the projects assessed by these experts. Moderators also ban or remove experts in case of gross violations of agreed rules and/or inappropriate formulations (the basic agreements are to be taken from the already established Catalyst Community agreements).
In addition moderators are to formulate a single, aggregated summary of a project based on the information/summaries provided by the experts assessing the specific project. The summary is to be formulated as coherent as possible for the Catalyst Voting participants and it shall be broken down according to criteria like e.g. economic, social, political benefits, costs, technical and personal requirements, beneficiaries and disadvantaged parties, environmental issues, aspects of decentralization, and others.
Another task for the moderators is to place the projects according to individual topic into groups, so that voters and potential users of the Cardano blockchain projects can access them in the easiest way possible, without having to navigate through an opaque and confusing jungle of projects like there currently is.
The experts registered and assigned by the moderators are given the main task to assess the projects by the mentioned criteria which are organized in more than the already excisting categories (impact, feasability and auditability) and above that, experts will give a coherent summary of each assessed project which is to be aggregated by the moderators to form a single summary which will be presented on the ""Catalyst Compass"" website. The summary must be comprehensible in general and furthermore give a detailed explanation concernig information in regard to technical, economic, political, etc. requirements.
The summary will be to give the Catalyst voters sufficient information about the specific project in order to let the voters make their vote with the highest possible level of awareness.
The incentives for experts (former CA's) and moderators (former vCA's) shall be processed through the fund raising budget and have an upper limit. This should prevent the number of potential experts to rise too high by limiting the payment for them either by an absolut maximum of payment or an absolut maximal number of engaged experts.
 
We aim to reform the Catalyst Community's assessment system based on the Cardano-ideascale website, to provide a more detailed and thus more accessible evaluation and presentation of all the upcoming projects set to be voted for by the Cardano community.
Hence, we want to merge with the Catalyst community and all the dedicated vCA's and CA's from there, to process the projects on an own website, but still keep the Cardano-ideascale website as a basis from which all the on our website assessed and presented projects are to be picked.
The internal collaboration shall be processed by the common and already established gateways via internet like for example: Discord.
 
Thus, we expect to get our project working within the first 1-3 months after the current Fund6 period. It only depends on the speed of the transition process adopting and appointing the moderators and experts from the pool of the current vCA's and CA's to our Catalyst Compass projects assessment system. A preliminary website has already been established (https://github.com/Catalyst-Compass).
 
We are currently cooperating with the Cardano Smart Voting proposal (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Smart-Voting/367168-48088) and try to merge both our ideas into one project. By implementing the proposed Smart Voting the assessing CA's shall be clustered into groups formed by consensus of interest and know-how. This would give rare assessment classes (e.g. because assessing a certain proposal needs knowledge which might be pretty rare) a higher value than others, which are more common and coherent for most advisors. By that, positive assessments of proposals, which suffer from a lesser attention only because the technical insight might not be as coherent and easy as those of other proposals, will become more valuable and thus receive a greater attention.
 
The number of participants in Catalyst voting is increasing rapidly, thus there is a need for user-friendly processing of the projects' evaluation and presentation which continues to grow accordingly. The benefit of our project is therefore beyond question and our ""Catalyst Compass"" team is working diligently and dedicatedly on its implementation. Basically, there is no question whether the project can be successful - it is an absolute must and will be a very useful tool for all users of the Catalyst Voting to orientate and appropiately evaluate the presented projects for themselves.
With 70 proposals funded in the Fund5 period and about 250,000 total votes from about 33,000 unique wallets (compared to 12 projects funded with about 24,000 votes in the period of Fund2), we have already reached an extent which needs to be managed by a dedicated group of people, specially composed for this very reason.
 
We are looking for active members who would like to share their ideas of how to make the voting easier for everybody. Thus, we would like you to become a member of our team if you are dedicated to support our project either with your ideas or by implementing our ideas. There is a lot of work to do and we are currently incapable of doing all this on our own. We need more active members who are willing to contribute to our project by co-creating, leading and supporting the ideas and the processing of this proposal. Every member will receive an allowance for any kind of useful input. To join our project, simply write a comment down below and we will invite you to our Discord channel, which is arranged for this very project. We are already looking forward to any additional kind of cooperation and support from you!

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
The Photrek and West Africa Decentralized Alliance (WADA) teams will collaborate to design and simulate a detailed voting and funding system that enables balancing of influence across a diverse decentralized autonomous organization and flexibility in the allocation of funds. While the focus will be a system for the Cardano Catalyst and Voltaire governance, the results will be applicable to the broader Cardano community developing DAOs. Key features of the system will be the ability to detect correlation in voting preference across wallets, use of the correlation measure to form virtual cliques of mutual interest, and use of power-law weightings, such as quadratic voting, to ensure that dominant cliques and/or individuals do not gain oligarchic control of decision making.
Proposed Outcomes 
(1) To model agent-based opinion, voting, and funding dynamics within the framework of the complex network;
(2) To use computer simulations for the time evolution of interaction network in the opinion, voting, and funding process;
(3) To analyze power-law voting designs and their generalizations for their ability to balance the voting influence, including the role of correlated cohorts of voters.
(4) To design and analyze methods of providing flexible funding levels so that well-supported projects are not eliminated by marginal differences between proposed and available funds.
(5) To design a voting and funding protocol, such as square-root voting across correlated cohorts, for implementation by Cardano Catalyst and other DOAs in the Cardano ecosystem.
Methodology and Impact
To investigate Cardano voting systems Photrek will employ Agent-based Models & Simulations, Voting & Funding Design, and Power-law Statistical Analysis. The outcome will be an evidence-based recommendation for a Diversified Voting & Flexible Funding System.
Agent-based Models & Simulationsconsist of a computational model that simulates the actions and interactions of multiple agents or individuals to re-create or predict the appearance of complex phenomena, where ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"". It represents the natural choice for our computational simulation scenario for uncovering the natural laws of voting and expressing opinions. On the other hand, the complex network framework ensures the substantial and non-trivial geometrical features representing the interaction between agents in voting assemblies. The key aspect of the complex network approach relies on the patterns of connection between their elements that are neither purely regular nor purely random, as the real-world networks of people are structured.
The Monte Carlo method is a statistical method that uses a sequence of random numbers to simulate the evolution of a physical system, especially useful for modeling social voting dynamics. The process is applied to a series of replicas of the same experiment (samples) to determine averaged configurational quantities as a physical result. The Monte Carlo method is exceptionally efficient for the simulation of systems with many local interactions, such as in problems of disordered materials, voting dynamics, consensus formation, disease spreading, and others.
Voting Design & Modelling. From our previous investigation (Cardano Catalyst Fund 4: Diversify Voting Influence), we identified the following power-law voting mechanics worthy of further investigation: Square Root Voting and Quadratic Voting and their generalizations with different powers. These designs empower us to build more effective and balanced voting mechanics for the Cardano ecosystem and to specify flexibility in the funding level of awarded projects. First, we can compose a voting power for each individual that depends on the size of their wallet and the selected power-law weighting. Secondly, the literature indicates that it is important that the voting influence be treated as a budget that the voter allocates across proposals as pseudo investments. This allows voters to concentrate their influence on proposals about which they have strong preferences rather than trying to evaluate all the proposals. Finally, the ""voting investment"" received by a proposal will be used to both rank and specify a degree of flexibility in the funding level awarded. The result is a Voting & Funding Design that balances influence and provides flexibility in assuring broadly supported proposals are awarded an appropriate funding level.
Power-law Statistical Analysis. The output of the voting design, modeling, and simulation will produce a rich collection of information from which we will extract valuable knowledge, noteworthy conclusions, and evidence to support diversified decision-making for the Cardano Catalyst Community. The evidence, conclusions, and knowledge will be formed using careful statistical analysis including statistical moments, such as the second moment and kurtosis. Additionally, because power-law systems have undefined or infinite moments, we will also utilize the innovations of Nonlinear Statistical Coupling, which was developed by Dr. Nelson for the purpose of estimating, generating, and analyzing the statistics of complex systems.
Diversified Voting & Flexible Funding System. In this stage, we share with the community the crucial points of our design and research regarding the implementation of an efficient, mathematically refined, and diversified voting and flexible funding mechanics for the Cardano Catalyst and other DOAs in the Cardano ecosystem.

In this work, we investigate how the presence of individuals with strong voting opinions affects a network of social interactions based on the majority-vote model. We find that such a weighted voting mechanism weakens the consensus of the network, imposing a fragile social-ordered regime, where opposing voting states dominate.

In this work, we propose a heterogeneous agent-based two-state sociophysics model to simulate the opinion dynamics on financial markets. Focusing on stock market trader dynamics, we propose a model with two kinds of individuals in which local and global interactions govern the dynamics of buying and selling investors. Despite its simplicity, our model presents such stylized facts of real financial markets and provides us insights regarding the voting dynamics influence on the stock market prices.

Often we have great team members behind us who we would like to pay properly, but would they accept less money if the budget was a bit tighter... probably yes. Do we need to get 100 t-shirts printed for our event, or if the budget is tightened, wouldn't 50 do the trick? Projects being submitted to Project Catalyst are often in the early stages, and therefore the budget is really an estimate, why are we penalizing proposers who miss the mark by amounts amounting to 5% or less of their total ask?
Project catalyst should start offering proposers the possibility to submit a minimum amount for funding as well as their actual budget (and possibly cap this number at 5%of the total proposed amount). This way once voting happens it allows projects that ""passed"" to be funded as long as the remaining amount is within a usable amount for their projects.

The world is full of creators and doers who don't want to sit back and watch, they want to create the future.  The hub for these creative souls are the 30,000+ co-workspaces  scattered around the world. From Lagos to HoChiMinh to London and San Francisco creatives can be found pouring over data trying to think of the next big idea. These individuals can and should build on the Cardano blockchain.  
Data on co-working spaces can be found here --> https://www.statista.com/statistics/1189761/coworking-footprint-americas/

Creative in the 30,000 workspaces across the globe frequently have low budgets but where they may be lacking in funds they make up for in boundless enthusiasm. If there is a way to get something built they will find it. This project is about reaching out to workspaces across the globe and providing them with a low cost No-Code Platform that supports building applications on Cardano.

Citizen Developers are are people with little to no knowledge of programming who build software using No-Code platforms like QModeler. The advent of No-Code has created a sea change in the way software is developed by allowing Citizen Developers to build software and communities to work collaboratively to create software solutions to problems. Citizen Developer is a new term to describe someone who is participating in building software products despite having little or no technical knowledge.The growth of Citizen development is estimated to be 30% per year and will overtake programming development in the next 3 years.

--------------------------------------------------------
5.1. Before going to the implementation plan, we would like to present some reasons for Establishing Vietnam Technology Startup Club on the Cardano blockchain platform.
As international integration deepens, all products on the market face stiff competition from domestic and foreign competitors. It is extremely important to ensure goods of good quality, clear origin, and reputable brands, directly affecting competitiveness. And the search for technological solutions to help trace the origin as well as protect the brand quickly, accurately, etc. has become a trend in the manufacturing field in general.
We will never forget the painful lessons of Vietnamese agricultural products when being ""victims"" of ""brain thieves"".
In 2000, Trung Nguyen coffee had to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get the domain name back in the US.
In 2008, Ben Tre coconut candy was branded stolen in China, causing export volume to plummet, from 900,000-1,000,000 tons/year to only a few tens of thousands of tons/year.
In 2011, Buon Ma Thuot coffee was registered for exclusive protection by China for 10 years in China, and was registered for exclusive protection by France in 10 other countries.
In 2011, Phu Quoc fish sauce was branded stolen in China, Thailand, Europe, and Australia.
And most recently, right in this 2021, are the pressing concerns related to the ST25 rice brand that 5 US businesses and 1 Australian business applied to register for ""protection"" of the brand.
The ST25, the Trung Nguyen coffee, the Phu Quoc fish sauce... are the clearest proofs of the disadvantage of Vietnamese agricultural products.
But it also shows the weakness of enterprises when they do not know, or do not drastic in ""asserting themselves"", ""protecting themselves"" in the domestic as well as international markets.
--> That is also the basis for us to help them find solutions based on Cardano in particular and Blockchain in general. For example, Traceability solutions and services for Vietnamese exports, or applications in the fields of Education and Health...
To do that, we should gather together into a Startup Club on the Cardano platform.

We find that the edited videos about workshops are more efficient. All the videos can be found under the Catalyst Swarm youtube account. Viewers have the ability to jump between contexts they are interested in using video chapters. From video descriptions, viewers can find open-source material to practice proposal ideation on their own.
 
We succeed if we empower proposers to pick up the mini-proposal template and create get their ideas out without a help of a facilitator.
Content starts to be published just before Fund 7
 
Measurements we track and want to reach
How many views are there on video 2 weeks after upload?
Goal to get an average of 40 views per video from 17 views
What is the average percent viewed per video?
Goal to reach 10% of video watched by everyone from current 3%
The time it takes in days to make ready video public since the session ended
The goal is to get videos out in 3 days, right now it takes about 6 days without any major edits.

To answer the question of how to gain more proposals from outside the current community, and involve all stakeholders at the root level, we need to:

Understand the behavior of all the stakeholders
Develop a Proposal Road Map that helps each group of stakeholders have:
an easy entry point
dissemination point &
certification & contribution point,
as well as a maintenance & audit layer that allows us to validate the onboarding process & fund sustainable paths towards onboarding new community members who lead to high quality, high impact proposers.

 
Easy Entry & Dissemination Points & Contribution Points: The simplified answer to the problem of attracting more & higher quality proposals is undertanding it is a behavior & engagement based question. To scale, Cardano needs to use an already established, user-friendly, community based platform such as BuddyBoss on Wordpress. We shouldn't re-invent the wheel when there is already a validated platform and the Cardano ecosystem can easily plug features such as ADA login from FUND1 into the platform and connect it to the blockchain.
We need to recognize by the various confusion of community members not knowing how to support other then buying ADA. And the recent issue of FUD going around, that the current channels and forums commonly used by developers is not sufficient for a broader wholistic community approach and is blocking us from receiving more & high quality proposals. This community platform includes an eLearning environment, connecting through visual based media & online/offline events to drive engagement. While allowing the community to develop certifications based on learning & experience to recognize more experienced members and build out a Mentor program to help onboard new Proposers.
 
Cost of the Problem: Total Crypto Market Share / Total Users = User Value (2.48 Trillion / 330 Million Users = $7,515 per user acquistion.
The Community is the most valuable asset of the Cardano ecosystem and needs to be strategically grown or Cardano will not be able to scale. The detailed solutions below are based on peer reviewed research and allow us to be more strategic about growing the Cardano Ecosystem and receiving higher quality propoydrom outside the current community. This challenge Solution is critical to achieve Cardano's mission.  Plenty of better technology has lost out because of lack of community adoption...Tivo as a great example. 
 
Deeper understanding of the Problem
Community Members feel a strong, loyal, shared identity with organizations that develop meaningful stories that help them believe in the world they want to live in. This not only means translating the language, but understanding the emotions and feelings in the stories that are being told. This is why UI/UX are CRITICAL Decisions and First Impressions are Everything. This is also key to understanding core values, beliefs & behaviors which are key to global scaling.
This means strategically developing the culture, so all stakeholders can be seen, felt & heard within an organization and find a sense of belonging within it. Currently, the Cardano Culture is not reaching the appropriate stakeholders beyond the crypto and development world. And this means we cannot truly have a decentralized government if the whole community is not involved because the appropriate tools are not available.
Science validates that Emotions, not facts, are the key drivers for buy-in to a new system, technology, transaction or relationship. Cardano lacks the feeling of Community outside the tech & crypto world, and many change agents are left unaware of the power of the Cardano Eco-System and how it can help them create the world they want to live in.
As these Change Agents discover Cardano and the community grows, it is clear by the copious comments, repeated questions and low % of community that is using the current forums, websites, multiple channels on various platforms; that the true power of the community is under-utilized and the Growth is far exceeding the capabilities of the current systems in place.
While Forums & chat channels are common for developers to use daily, they are blocks to wider spread adoption and means community talent is not finding the right entry-points to discover where they can best fit into the growing community and find a sense of belonging. As evidenced by the current community which is not fully diversified but predominantly male and tech heavy. There is a huge opportunity for improvement.
Currently Cardano lacks the User Friendly Hub to act as the central point, to attract in new members & projects and ensure they know the who, what, when, where, why & how to become an active contributing member within the Cardano Eco-System and submit high quality proposals. Currently greater than 12.5% of the submitted proposals are lacking basic requirements.
 
Deeper Understanding of the Solution
The Cardano Community Campus will allow new Cardano Community Members to have a welcoming place of entry and quickly find the mentors, tools, resources and sense of belonging that is needed to drive not just more proposals, but high quality, high impact, world changing proposals.

In order to attract in new members, we must have an entry point that is not only welcoming, but contains a UX design that is recognizable and easy to navigate for all user types.
We must also have an effective way to share the values & principles of the Cardano Eco-System that is friendly to users of all levels & backgrounds. It must resonate with their ""Why."" It must not only be available in their language, but also told in a way that makes sense for immediate buy in and drive engagement. Engaged users submit proposals.
We must be able to quickly identify and segment new users to be able to direct them to the appropriate people, places, events & areas of contribution, so they can quickly feel a sense of belonging in the community.
Once it can be felt, it can drive mass scale adoption to people of all different backgrounds. Feeling Trust begins with being able to feel it in a diversified Cardano Community Campus. The leading way that Community Builders, Marketers, Sales, Growth Experts and even Multi-National companies look at diversifying and growing their clients is by segmenting them into Cultural Archetypes, mainly 12 core archetypes (https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/cultural-archetypes). These 12 Archetypes as a whole are representative of a healthy community, so when we serve each of them, we gain a more well-rounded representation of the people that will benefit from the Cardano Eco-system. And become the leading blockchain that ALL people trust and want to create projects with.
These Archetypes work because they primarily consist of a common set of core values & behaviors. This allows the Cardano community to communicate the benefits of how the Cardano ecosystem benefits them in a way that each Archetypal segment can feel & understand. Ae can preemptively identify challenge areas. And it will allow the Cardano community to segment itself into natural and psychological core groups, where the new members will quickly feel a sense of belonging and connect with the people and projects that are most aligned with them.
This type of hub invites in entrepreneurs, marketing experts, social change agents, artists, local community members and project owners to get a more well-rounded real life community that is looking to change the world.
This not only leads to increased proposals in Catalyst, but more diversified ideas that can affect the real world and better the ENTIRE community. This drives mass user adoption.
Many of the initiatives that are proposed in this round under this challenge and in the other challenges will benefit from this initiative. Because they can be accomplished on top of, enhanced by and with the support of this initiative. By creating white listed media, marketing & eductional materials that is already organized based on the archetypal end user stories, we create stories that have network effect.
Even for the Language challenge, we must not only get the language correct, we must also get the way in which it is told correct. As an example, what does the word ""Padre"" mean to you? While the literal translation is ""Father,"" each of us will have a very different image appear in our head as an S. American Father, is different from an N. American Father is different from a Middle Eastern Father, etc... This hub then is a foundational tool because it not only helps us reach farther, but it ensures that the Culture, Values, & Beliefs we want to maintain as a community are transmitted with the reach as well.
This is what will differentiate us from the competition and allow us to gain worldwide adoption and work on High-Impact projects that will change the world.

Recruitment of other key Roles
Roles
Roles will be solicited from the community 1st and voted on using a shared governance.


Project Manager - Sourced from Community and/or Myself


Community Manager - Sourced from Community and/or Myself


Development Team - Contracted & Used on Previous Projects and/or Sourced from Community


Server setup & Optimization


2 BuddyBoss Developers


IT Maintenance


Content Creation - Sourced from Community and/or Myself (Archetypes)


Estimated Timeline
We aim to do quality peer-reviewed approach to ensure this Community Hub is a foundation upon which the Cardano Community will grow. So we will spend the 1st month doing a proper needs assessment, current culture assessment, and GAP Analysis while also recruiting initial stakeholders who will be instrumental in growing the project. And establish a sociacracy for sustainable long term self-governance of the project.
By the end of 2nd month we will launch the initial MVP and ensure we are rapidly iterating on the feedback every 2 weeks with the initial invested stakeholders. We will also be creating re-usable content that will be focused on material to increase the awareness of the Catalyst, Certification for Proposers, the Core Culture of Cardano and how to use Cultural Archetypes to tell stories that will drive Mass User Adoption (Outside Proposers).
By month 3 we will deliver the 1st phase of the Community Hub with its core functionality such as the User Profiles, User Roles, LearnDash, EventsPro & Zoom Integrations. This will allow us to start using the platform with a wider audience and do another assessment during our staged 1 invitation phase. We will also have the new community member onboarding roadmap and content complete. This includes the Cultural Archetypal Education to ensure the culture of Cardano & Catalyst is being told in a way it can be received by ALL community members. This will allow us to do another deep assessment round and find any gaps.
By month 4 we will have stage 2 invitations and compile our up-to-date Gap Analysis. We will have a functioning site ready that will be able to invite the current community forward and recruit additional stakeholders to improve the deficiencies found in the Gap Analysis. We will develop a Continual Improvement Processes so that the project can be fully self governed & decentralized.
By the Start of month 5 we will be able to open up the Hub for all new users as they come into the Cardano Community and ensure everyone can be welcomed in a way that feels welcomed to them and quickly find their sense of belonging where they can contribute their unique skills & talents to the community.
Month 6 will be inviting in new stakeholders and finalizing the governance model that will make the project fully self sustainable, including compiling any documentation, training materials and allowing for a month of hand offs or training for any new role transitions.
Month 12 User Growth over 1 Million! with 10% proposing! 
 
Cardano Eco-System Value
Wordpress allows for easy integration of dApps that be integrated to work with the platform. We will seek out partners to use for things like sign in, personal data control, events from this challenge, payments & reputation tracking for users.
 
Sustainability
Since Cultural Archetypes are the key ways to understand users when developing products, we have a wealth of information from the Cardano Community that can be used through an Opt-In model to help partners in the Cardano Eco-system develop products, road maps, customer journeys, marketing stories, and user adoption & growth paths that benefit the Cardano Community as a whole. We will look at a transparent way to monetize this data to benefit the Cardano Eco-System as a whole. This will also make Cardano a household name as it becomes the recognized place where the new world is being created that we all want to live in.
Various paid levels or other profit models can be assessed once self governance fully established

Plan
Since this portal will be managed & sustained by the community, we want to make it, so Admins only have to have Medium level Tech Knowledge. The BuddyBoss Wordpress Platform & Mobile App will be used to create a community hub to welcome new members, determine their cultural archetype and help them connect with the right people & projects.

The Reasoning & Research Behind Visual Media, Community Based & eLearning Platforms
Visual content
Visual content has to be a focal point in any marketing strategy, because of its strong relation with the human nature. The important impact of images and videos, along with the ease of today's production of graphical content, are critical factors in favor of marketing engagement through visual content. With the help of images, in any form they present themselves, brands can achieve the desired reach and recognition, making marketing investments more efficient. (Manic, 2015).
Community Platform
Branded co-innovation communities are an important sub-segment, mainly serving brand-related purposes, such as equity (Brady et al., 2008), loyalty (Kuo and Feng, 2013) and recruitment(Wallace et al., 2014).
Stanoevska-Slabeva, Schmid (2001) discovered key community specific modules of media & community platforms were identified. These are: modules for management of participants, common vocabulary, shared history as well as for enforcement and mapping of the organizational structure of the community. All this should be created by the community through interaction on the platform. Platforms that do not provide facilities for communication between users will have difficulties to establish a community.
The transaction cost theory can shed a light on a particular aspect of online communities, namely, social interaction structure that links individuals to collective arrangements (Ciborra, 1996; Resca, 2006; Kallinikos, 2011). Based on the transaction cost theory, Shirky (2008) views the social inter- actions in the virtual world as populated not only by collaborations (i.e., peer production) but also by information sharing and collective action. These three distinct structures provide a basis for developing the purpose and scope and the principles of form and function of DPsOC (Digital Platforms that Support Online Community (Pradhan and Odugbemi, 2011; Obar et al., 2012). This Solution addresses all three.
eLearning
A CoP (Community of Practice) is a group of people who share concerns, deal with complex issues concerning a certain topic, broaden their knowledge and experience in the professional field, as well as interact on a regular basis (Lave and Wenger, 1998). According to the latest definitions given by Etienne and Beverly Lave, J. and Wenger-Trayner, E. (Wenger-Trayner and Wenger-Trayner, 2015), a CoP is a spontaneously emerging group of people who share a concern or passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly, and it is seen as an innovative way to create and share organizational knowledge (Wenger and Snyder, 2000). The concept of the CoP has evolved from the explanatory framework to its practical application through the construction and sharing of stories, and through joint problem solving.
eLearning within CoP for sustainable development presents synergic effect of two knowledge management tools and proves the selection of learning strategies on: competitive test-driven learning process through the developed curriculum which meets the learning needs, experiential learning where participants have ""space"" to acquire knowledge and demonstrate their ability to apply this knowledge and skills of strategic managing by projects and the very project management as tactics to implement the organization's mission, as well as cooperative learning where participants are emotionally involved in the co-creation, by performing new skills and sharing feelings from the experience in the CoP. Thus, a well-designed combination of two knowledge management tools – eLearning and CoP – promotes:

• learners' ability to understand and work with assessment criteria for applying in best way their knowledge in PM;
• learners' authentic academic practice as a sponsor during peer review for advancing one's skills, reflections and insights, through articulating judgments and giving constructive feedback;
• possibility to get quicker and more individualized feedback from peers for improving their project concepts;
• experiencing personal success and avoiding learners' reliance only on tutors' opinions; triangulation – the original submission, peer reviews, tutor assessment and self-assessment can be compared, giving learners new perspectives on their submission, the criteria and the reviews they have written and received;
• feeling ""in control"" of the learning situation while practicing newly acquired knowledge, feeling arousal and mobilization to act, as well as excitement and satisfaction of one's performance; and
• learners' emotions and feelings in the learning process as an important element for memorizing new information, developing competence, sharing best practice and personal professional growth (Katernyak, Loboda, Kulya 2018).

The asynchronous nature of online communication and the potential for disconnectedness has focused attention on the issue of community. In support of this perspective, there is evidence that a sense of community can be created online, although this is not a trivial challenge (Rovai, 2002 & Thompson, McDonald 2005). It has also been shown that sense of community is significantly associated with perceived learning (Shea 2006 & Henry, 1996).
One of, if not the first, framework that identified both social and cognitive dimensions for studying online learning was provided by Henri 1996). This work inspired Garrison, Anderson and Archer (200) to develop a comprehensive framework as an online learning research tool (see Figure 1). The framework consisted of three elements—social, teaching and cognitive presence.
 
The Reasoning & Research Behind Cultural Archetypes
In 2015, cultural archetypes was established as an alternative approach to the cultural distance construct, introduced by Geert Hofstede in the 1980s. Archetypes thread together the universal, group & individual, and thus can create discourse and relationship between universal, community, & individual visions, beliefs & behaviors. This human resources can leverage on[Cultural Archetypes] driving force to extract the best of it, so that people satisfy their needs, and so does the organization, reaching a mutual benefit.
According to Solberg (1997), the decision according to which a company should begin an internationalization process or further strengthen its position in international markets shall be pondered considering two dimensions: industry globalism and the company's preparedness for internationalization. The former indicates the competitive structure of the industry, while the latter encompasses all company's capital to manage the internationalization, be it physical (financial resources), social (relationships) or human (management's experience, language skills, cultural knowledge and sensitivity, and so) (Hollensen, 2007).
With the rising competition in recent decades, companies have basically the following two options: get into a price war or seek to differentiate their products. Many of the companies that seek this latter one try to conquer their customers giving life and meaning to their vision, creating a relationship between users, technology and company vision(Martins, 1999), since differentiation based only on physical characteristics of the product is no longer enough. To effectively identify and leverage the essential elements of the brands it is necessary to become fluent in the visual and verbal language of archetypes (Mark & Pearson, 2012).
Archetypes are story characters – prototypes of culturally important figures to create healthy communities – that are learned and recognized implicitly and whose historical and personal significance evoke emotional reactions (Faber & Mayer, 2009). Archetypes are commonly understood as the universal themes of our shared human existence evident in the communality of characters and story that cross culture and geography (McPeek, 2008). Thus, the archetypes can be used by organizations, addressing both the concept of the companies vision and the effective and in, effective communication that grows community. Brands can capture the essential meaning of the category to which they belong and communicate this message in a subtle and refined way (Mark & Pearson, 2012) if they are conscious of it and cultivate it.
Using circular based economies as a relative example, since they both contain disruptive and decentralized based economies similar to the vision of Charles Hoskinson vision of the blockchain. We can learn from this research the challenges to their implementation. The research shows that limited progress in CEBM im- plementation by companies has been associated to various barriers ranging from cultural, regulatory, market and technological aspects (de Jesus and Mendonça, 2018; Kirchherr et al., 2018). (The same challenges the blockchain faces to mass adoption(. Although technological barriers are dominant in literature, Kirchherr et al. (2018) show that cultural barriers are the most pressing type of barriers according to companies and policy-makers. In particular, a hesitant or- ganisational culture and limited awareness, information, and in-house competencies are considered core barriers for the implementation of CEBMs by companies (de Jesus and Mendonça, 2018; Guldmann and Huulgaard, 2020; Kirchherr et al., 2018). Companies require support to reinvent the way they innovate, with a more holistic and business-oriented perspective (de Jesus and Mendonça, 2018).

Develop a platform where proposers can find skilled mentors from the Cardano's community that help to deliver solid proposals.",18,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 04:00",Alex Pestchanker,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Alex-Pestchanker/3096845-48088,Philip Khoo,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Philip-Khoo/3057724-48088,39000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The current Cardano's proposals funding process is attracting more and more proposers each fund, with an aim to reach more and more outside proposers out of brilliant entrepreneurs and purpose driven enthusiast to reach our goal to impact 1 Billion people.
During Fund5 there were around 316 proposals received, with 112 (35%) securing funds. 143 (45%) of those proposals were not approved by voters (negative votes vs positive votes spread) and 214 (67%) got less than a 4 score assessment by CAs.
This situation creates an increasing frustration among proposers, and this has the potential to worsen as more proposals are submitted and Cardano's growth accelerates. Increasing complexity of the space means that it is vital to keep proposals quality high by increased understanding of challenges and proposal's feasibility criteria and other key factors of the proposal process.
This situation is significantly harder for new proposers and outsiders. How can we make a difficult space easier. How can we help onboard the proposers that have been encouraged to join the space?
The Solution
We propose to facilitate proposal creation, promotion and execution, by enabling proposers to find help among skilled members of the Cardano's community that are willing to mentor projects and proposers. Working towards the achievement of outstanding results, value and increase the chances of being funded.
A dual sided market platform will be created to generate a Mentor Marketplace, where proposers can find, engage with or get matched to mentors.
This platform will serve as a unique directory of ranked mentors, that offer their help to proposal building, promotion and even execution (after funding). Mentors profile and success metrics will be visible at the platform, with certain key attributes that help the proposer to select/be matched to the relevant mentors who can help bring their ideas to become reality.
Mentor's will be able to monetize their advice, agreeing with the proposers during the process - a coming together to an agreement. We see that this might be in the form of pre-funding payment, post funding payment, equity interest or some mix or other in kind payment. The platform will help facilitate the agreement process.
In this initial stage we will experiment with this open option to learn what are the different monetization needs from the community. Later the platform could leverage smart contracts to help with the monetization of the efforts and the marketplace itself, and maybe helping also Cardano's to send and track funding for proposals.
We plan to leverage other projects that can help to increase our delivery speed, as well as to standardize the platform so many new functionalities can be built upon this marketplace, such as a possible partnership with the Community Members profile site (https://projectcatalyst.org/api/graphql).
The Team
The proposers have extensive experience in creating value added projects, and are committed to the Cardano's community as Community Advisors. Phil has a business and design background and has already successfully funded proposals in funds 4 and 5 funded which are: Community tools (https://cardanocataly.st/en/tools)and Community Landing Page (https://cardanocataly.st/).
Skilled developers and UX/UI designers will be hired to execute the technical aspects of the project. We have a understanding that Blace.io (a Catalyst spawned marketplace base layer https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Blace-io-Marketplace-Creator/368797-48088)) is under pre-funding development. We are in discussion with the team responsible for the project as a possible base layer for out market place.
This project also has the support of the Cardano AIM team.
Estimated Timeline
We aim to reach a first MVP within first two months, giving us time to get the team together and for blace.io releases their first versions for testing. We then plan to work towards a new release each month (each 2 Sprints).
This first phase of the project will last around 4 months, to deliver a first version of the platform, with core functionality such as having mentor's profiles searchable, with filter criteria functionality, and a way to produce the match/communication between parties.
After the first 4 months, we will aim to produce new evolution based on the insights obtained during the first phase, the type of business model that end up being selected and the willingness/approval/adoption by the community.
Sustainability (Business Model) and Challenge fit
In this phase we want to provide a free version of the platform to help build up momentum and give back to the community the funds obtained to jump starting the platform.
If the experiment is successful we can either continue to provide a free version (funded by the community) or produce a fee based model - we are considering perhaps a small percentage of funded proposals. So in both models the Cardano's ecosystem will benefit from more and higher quality proposals and more proposers (specially from outside the ecosystem), thus aligning with this challenge goal. By facilitating better ways to be involved with developing value on top of Cardano. Also by generating a source of income for Mentor's we will incentivize that mentor's participation and in the future work towards bring more projects to Cardano through referrals.
Key Metrics
These can be measured by engagement fund to fund:
Number of mentors actively on the platform
Number of proposals onboarded through the platform
Number of successful proposals mentored through the platform
Costs structure
3 Developers/UX - USD 3000 per month each - USD 36.000
2 Founders/Project Leader fees, USD 2.000 each.
Infrastructure and other platforms costs, USD 1000.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We need to think bigger, beyond our small but growing ecosystem, in relation to the majority of people in the world who are currently unaware of Cardano and Project Catalyst. Myself, my co-proposer and our entertainment industry partners have been working behind the scenes to structure a viable plan with the end goal of creating a large scale film project.
Our goal is to reach a global audience by tapping into pop culture's action/adventure film entertainment market. Action/adventure films are one of the leading genre films and bodes well as the backdrop for our hero product of CARDANO.
HOW WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS
We will tap into the several relationships we have built in the filmmaking industry ranging from studio relationships, global distribution channels, top tier talent including writers, actors and directors to put together a feasible total film package. Some of studio connections include but not limited to Tyler Perry Studios (Atlanta GA), Nu Boyana Studios (Sofia, Bulgaria). Distributors such as Lionsgate's Grindstone Entertainment Group. And Production companies that specialize in foreign sales such as Crystal Sky Pictures, AAA Entertainment (Johannesburg, South Africa).
GOALS: Short/Mid Term
Attracting Proposers - While this proposal falls within the realm of entertainment/filmmaking which carries a longer than average time horizon, the short/mid term goal will be to facilitate maximum community involvement within the Cardano community. This includes yet-to-be proposers who may have not yet submitted a proposal who wish to have product placement. The goal is to expose the creative spirit that this community possesses in addition to telling an interesting and compelling story.
With that, looking forward to Fund7 and beyond, we would collaborate on specifics and initiate separate ""sub-proposals"" for those interested parties looking for product placement and allow the Cardano community vote on the ones they would like to include in the film. This direct interaction would give anyone looking to gain exposure the opportunity to do so, with the community voting as they do currently on standard proposals.
*Interest and engagement within these film-specific ""sub-proposals"" would be one easily measurable KPI
Long Term
While a project of this scope has never been done before, it has never stopped anyone in IOG, Cardano community members, pioneers and everyday dreamers who find themselves drawn to this project and all it offers the world, from making history. Our long term goal beyond seeing this grow from idea to final product with worldwide distribution and high production value would be to facilitate the onboarding and education of any mainstream entertainment professionals looking to create and interact with Cardano and it's vibrant community.

Hello, thank you for visiting our proposal,

Bridging the Digital & Analog Worlds
This proposal is in essence to create a bridge between Cardono Catalyst and industry organisations, business advisors and entrepreneurs around the world.
These organisations could be general ones such as Chambers of Commerce and also industry specific organisations offering help, advice and support to members of their business community.
Educate & Give Use Cases
We also propose to identify potential synergies between different companies to create a new project where both entities would support each other to create new proposals.
While introducing the concept of catalyst, there would be an element of education about what we are calling crypto venture capital (CVC). The education would also include proposals as to how a particular industry all business could benefit by connecting with the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry to make their business more efficient and profitable.
Business Students
Another area where we were would proactively approach would be business students around the world who presumably are planning to enter the business world and may have ideas that could be launched on the cardano blockchain.
Corporate Advisors
We would also like to run an outreach campaign to accountants, company formation agents and lawyers because they are quite often a first point of contact by entrepreneurs looking to start a business enterprise.
People of Influence
In all cases of outreach, we will be looking for gatekeepers, or influencers to substantial groups and communities in order to efficiently get the message out to as many people as possible.
Multi-Lingual & Multi Country
To make this fully effective we would translate all of the current fund's challenges into various languages in order to inform each target country about the current opportunities. We would also give guidance as to how to apply from the currently running fund.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

The Eastern Townhall wants to establish a growing network of East Asian entrepreneurs. Where they can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other. Thinking global, acting local.
PLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE
Current Problems and Limitation
Recall a moment when you realised if you poked something, pushed it or moulded it, something new and interesting popped out the other side. We're here again and this time on a global scale. We, the Cardano Catalyst community are pioneers in a new mindset. A new way of governing and funding. But to make a dent in the universe we need entrepreneurs. People are willing to take a risk, to poke, to push, and to mould new ways of doing.
Reaching Entrepreneurs is difficult when language and cultural barriers exist. Local context may also have undeveloped startup funding programmes too. This can result in unrealized startup funding opportunities. Few East Asian entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities and the technical, economic benefits of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology within local communities to address local market opportunities. We want to change that.
The Team
A collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:

We are working with Venture Centre[1], IdeaFest[2], and Catalyst School[3]; as part of the proposal, we aim to work with Enterprenerdy[4], Emurgo[5], local Universities, and IOG's Catalyst Team.
Proposed Solution: Cardano StartUp Week
This proposal is about running virtual events in January/February 2022 to develop entrepreneurs in Vietnam and Indonesia. The event aims to upskill entrepreneurs to develop market opportunities based on Cardano.
The purpose of the event is to build startup founders and Distributed Autonomous Organisation (DAO) collaborators. We are not building startups! Our intent is to educate. Focusing on experience-based learning by providing a soft way for the general public to access entrepreneurship and blockchain technology without risk.
The event will happen over four weeks:
Virtual Networking (Week 1 & 2): The first two weeks of the event is about Networking. Getting registered participants to meet each other, discuss their ideas and aspirations. Tutorial sessions will be held to help upskill and familiarise people with business design tools.
Pitch and Team-Up (Start of Week 3): All participants come together for the opening event where individual participants can give a 60-second pitch of a project idea they want to pursue. People vote with their feet by choosing to join a team.
Learn and Work (Week 3 & 4): Over the next two weeks, teams start working together. Mentors are assigned. Special sessions are run with experts. Teams are encouraged to validate their ideas with potential customers. Throughout the two weeks, each team will have four 30min pitch sessions with a panel of mentors that help them refine their pitch and Catalyst Proposal.
Pitch (End of Week 4): All participants come together for the closing event. The pitch! Each team is given five minutes to present their market problem and their solution to a panellist that ask questions. To pitch every team must have submitted their proposal to Catalyst. When all presentations are given the audience will pick the winning teams. Prizes will be awarded. We all celebrate! At the conclusion of Fund 8, Catalyst Voters choose who to fund.
The event will focus on Cardano Blockchain solutions and place emphasis on using Business Model Generation, Customer Development approaches and the use of analytical tools like Lean Startup, the Platform Design Toolkit, and Wardley Mapping.
By the time proposals are submitted in Fund 8, entrepreneurial teams will have formed, worked together, finished customer testing, and developed robust business models.
What Success Looks Like
The event is planned to finish on conclusion of the second week of Catalyst fund 8, Feburary 2022. Teams will be submitting proposals to Catalyst Fund 8 as part of their work.

Various studies have shown that audiences ​lose their attention after seven seconds. Visual creativity has the power to engage and attract new users. In general, graphic design in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space is a very similar style, which causes visual fatigue.
Since we aim to target and recruit new followers of Cardano, we need to think strategically about user behavior. The user journey usually starts with awareness (engagement), then perceptions are changed (users learn more), and finally, affinity is achieved (users become proposers). 
 
HOW IT WORKS
Social media is a great way to deliver the latest Cardano projects and encourage adopting initiatives developed in previous funds. We have seen many ADA creators use meme images to enhance ADA's exposure. We also have a great community, and members support most ADA topics.
We will work with talented illustrators with international experience to plan the social media calendar and editorial illustrations together.
We expect to deliver Cardano and Catalyst news innovatively, with a digestible visual style. Social media posts will be direct, straightforward, humorous, and inspiring. The objective is to reach more potential audiences and encourage higher engagement.
 
Social Media Monthly Calendar Plan to have:
Three quality posts every week. Each post will come with a series of at least five images.
 
Budget Proposal

Co-op with 1-2 illustrators to create editorial content | $3,000*6 months = 18,000
Social media push | $200 per month*6 months= 1,200
Digital Marketing Coordinator | $800*6 months= 4,800

To attract entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano community, we need to grab their attention. Times Square represents the most vibrant commercial project on Earth, guaranteeing exposure.
Our organization specializes in conducting interactive digital out-of-home (DOOH) campaigns on Times Square. We are proposing to develop a similar campaign for Cardano ADA to be screened on Times Square billboards.
This exposure will incentivize young entrepreneurs to invest in ADA. We will provide ADA proposers with the opportunity to select the most compelling ideas for funds 7 and 8. We would also encourage young entrepreneurs to endorse the Cardano community and share the campaign on their channels. 
Interactive DOOH Campaign
Phase 1
To start, we will launch an interactive DOOH campaign countdown clock for funds 7 and 8 to generate a buzz.
Phase 2
During phase two, we will show the real-time status of the submission using dynamic graphics to make the process more fun, competitive, and exciting.
Cardano's official social media account can post the billboard live feed to amplify the event.
Phase 3
Finally, in phase three, we will announce the most exciting ideas of 2021.

Organize a bi-monthly discussions in a small concert hall here in Moundon - Switzreland (ragular dates, always same place) - around 20-30 people/session
Take the time to explain what are blockchains, how blockchains are already working in our society and the positive potential impacts.
I'm David Blanchet, a 50Y old guy, in import/export industry since too long! 
My hobby, since more than 20 years, is to organize music events. I deeply think during these very scyr times, Caradno can bring a positive message to people who are not yet clear with world changes.
Wish to share my vision of today and tomorrow's world with local people and why not, make this movement growing in the future.
To be explained to people during those sessions:
- what is the utility of cryptos and what is behind a crypto such as team people, project & aims (speaker: Youtuber i.e.)
- how Cardano is built, who is the owner, why Carano exists (speaker from Caradono Foundation ZRH)
- why the Swisspost is in (speaker from YUH or Swissquote)
- what is a wallet (speaker me)
- what is a DEX (speaker me)
- CDBC: what they are, which countries have launched a project, which is already working with CBDC etc.
 
Starting end of October, after the first 3 month of sessions, more people should enter in the new world.
I am not someone who comes from IT. So I would need to create a small team to create an application to:
- confirm their presence during the sessions
- confirm or not their interest in Cardano or cryptos 
- allow them to have a direct link with the YUH application 
- allow them to have a direct link with the YOROI/DEADALUS applications
- allow access to the vaccine certificate if needed (by these times, we never know...)
This last point may have impact on the funds request.
Today, funds are structured like this (and subject to be reviewed):
I considered that all speaker are coming for free as the aim of these sessions is only the ""mass"" adoption of cryptos.
- Hardware material (projector, screen(s), recorder) 1800$ (or made available by the Cardano Foundation)
- Room rent (20 events) 2600$
- Marketing, communcation (20 events) 6000$
- Backstage and welcome of the speakers 2000$
- Reserve 1000$
Piece by peace the world will change:)

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The idea is separated into a three parts:
1. Gather a following by producing good crypto content and working with crypto projects in the space. Part of the first part is that I like to invest games which show people different crypto concepts. For instance, a card and dice game that explains IPFS or a drinking game that explains how centralized vs decentralized stores of value work or a drinking game that explains Bitcoin Mining. (an excellent three month goal would be to make over 100 videos and have over a thousand followers)
2. Leverage that following to earn collabs with non crypto content creators. Specifically ones with 200,000 to 500,000 followers. I believe that people dive into their interests on the internet so we must bring crypto to them - not in the main stream media, but in our internet communities. Then theme crypto concepts around their channel. If it's a guitar channel, then explain bitcoin mining by randomly picking a note to play on the guitar and have two guitarists dual it out to try to play the random note that keeps changing when they hit it. The goal of this outreach isn't to teach blockchain, many people already know the concepts fairly well. It's to translate it and show them how simple, easy to understand concepts can come together to create something powerful and liberating. (an excellent six month goal, at this phase, would be to partner with at least three youtube channels with followers between 100,000-300,000 and earn over 100,000 followers)
3. After the channel has grown and more people are starting to geniunely understand blockchain, I want to use the revenue generated from the channel to go towards setting up stake pools for underpriviledged communities. I want black communities to be able to generate enough money from their stake pools to hire their own police force. It may be small, but they're not going to hire people who will kill their kids. I want community run initiatives like local radio to put their savings into stake pools and allow people to delegate instead of doing charity. After people are educated, we can start to set things up for people and raise up the 99% (an excellent twelve month goal would be to create at least one decentralized organization behind a charitable cause)
*note, the goals referenced above would be much longer but I am guessing that receiving Project Catalyst funding from IOHK is something that might help attract a lot of viewers to the channel
 
I ask the funds for my project simply be a donation to my stake pool that you'd hold there for a year. I'd then use the money my pool generates to fund the content creation on top of side hustles. Would also be looking to grow the team if at all possible. On my own I don't need much, honestly. Maybe $50,000 a year and i can honestly get most of it on my own. What's cool about the money being handled through a Stake Pool is that it'll be very transparent. I will be using the money to purchase food, internet, and electricity while I make nonstop educational crypto content.
 
Success, for me, will be determined by follower count. While I think BitBoy cryptos success is probably well deserved, I think his channel has become quite the centralized party. Since it's hard to put a metric on success educating the entire globe, I think a good goal would be to become the largest cryptocurrency channel on the internet.
 
Launch date already happened because I've already started making videos.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Problem Statement (In detail)
Compared to the size of ADA holders, Japan has less involvement in the community, especially the number of Catalyst proposers. The reason is that most Japanese holders already have their main business and cannot afford to participate as proposers. In addition, they are getting enough rewards from staking. That's why they are not ambitious to raise funds in Catalyst. Therefore, it is difficult to increase the number of new Catalyst proposers from the current Japanese community.
 
Solution (In detail)
To increase the number of new Japanese proposers, it is necessary to attract new proposers who have plenty of time and are highly motivated to raise funds—for example, young entrepreneurs, including students on the outside. However, at present, Catalyst is not well known in Japan. Therefore, we will hold an online seminar to explain Catalyst's potential. And we will gather young entrepreneurs interested in Catalyst and support them to propose their new idea in the next Fund.
 
Related Experience (In detail)
We hosted an online meetup for the Japanese community at Pretix in July, attracting more than 100 participants. In that meet-up, for those who are not familiar with the potential of Cardano, I explained the mechanism of blockchain and the features of ADA in comparison with BTC and ETH. In addition, we attend the Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall Meeting every week to promote Catalyst. I am explaining the potential of Catalyst and how to participate there. And every time, 40 to 50 participants are gathered in the breakout room in Japan.

Ranket: A community member familiar with cryptocurrencies (Supervision of seminars)
* Miyatake, Issa, Yuta: Support after the seminar
 
The Main Target is Young Entrepreneurs
Our goal is to increase Japanese Catalyst proposers, especially young entrepreneurs, including students interested in using blockchain. There are two reasons to make the main target a young entrepreneur.
First, since I am a sophomore, I can use various campus resources, such as club activities and entrepreneurship training programs, to approach students who want to become entrepreneurs.
Second, if young entrepreneurs can use Catalyst's resources, they have a high probability of succeeding in their business. For example, Catalyst can provide the following resources.
1, Catalyst funds proposers without investor connections
2, Catalyst gives various feedbacks of the proposer's ideas
3, Catalyst provide proposers with Cardano blockchain technology
If we can teach young entrepreneurs about the existence of Catalyst and how to use it, they will definitely participate as proposers.
 
How to Attract Young Entrepreneurs
To achieve our goal, it is necessary to approach a wide range of people who are even a little interested in Cardano ADA. Therefore, we take the following approach.
・ By holding online, we can gather participants from all over the country.
・ We will share the seminar archive with those who applied for the seminar from the event portal site. Therefore, even those who could not attend on the day can see the seminar contents.
・ The members who participated in this proposal are well known in the Japanese community and are connected to many SPOs. Therefore, we will ask them to spread our seminar.
・ At Waseda University, where I attend, there are several entrepreneurship training programs, and I have also participated. Since such programs have frequent events and lectures, we will also aim to cooperate with such programs. If we can work together, we can bring many students to our seminar.
 
Roadmap
Our strategy is divided into two. The main seminars attract new proposers from the outside. And the sub seminars activate the current community. Details of each strategy will be described below.
・ Holding the main seminars
We will hold a two-day online seminar every month using the event portal site and zoom. We are planning to hold a total of 4 times. And the first seminar will be held in November. After each seminar, we will recruit people interested in Catalyst proposers and create an SNS group with them. In that group, experienced proposers, including myself and Yuta, will fully support them from proposal to implementation in Catalyst and increase the number of Catalyst proposers.
・ Holding and continuing the sub seminars
1. Activities at the Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall Meeting
We attend Eastern Hemisphere Town Hall Meeting every week and promote Catalyst in our breakout rooms in Japan. We will continue these activities in the future.
2. Cardano blockchain promotion activities in rural areas
We will also work on promoting the Cardano blockchain in rural areas. We have already received a request for a lecture from the general incorporated association ""Kittamu,"" which is working on regional revitalization in Yoshinogawa City, Tokushima Prefecture.
 
KPI
・ Gather more than 50 participants at each seminar
(We will gather all people interested in Cardano ADA, including students and young entrepreneurs)
・ Gather 5 or more new proposal participants in one seminar
(Increase 5 proposal participants, including team members, not increase 5 new proposals)
・ Increase the number of Japanese proposal participants by 20 or more in 4 months.

Self-Introduction
My name is Issa Ichikawa.
I am a sophomore at Waseda University in Japan and plan to start a business related to Cardano blockchain. My father was one of the Official Cardano Ambassadors, and I heard about Cardano from him. When I heard Charles Hoskinson's speech at TED, I was so impressed with his vision and decided to start a business related to Cardano. After studying Cardano for several months, I am currently working as a presenter who lectures the basic knowledge of Cardano for beginners together with Toshiaki Miyatake: IOG Japan Campaign Manager.
I have two strong points in implementing this proposal.
First, I am good at explaining difficult content in an easy-to-understand manner, and the participants highly evaluated the past three presentations I actually gave. Since I studied blockchain from scratch, I understand the points that are difficult for beginners to understand.
Second, I'm familiar with the problems and needs of student entrepreneurs because I'm actually a student. Therefore, I can provide more appropriate support to student entrepreneurs than others. In addition, if this proposal goes through, I can share my funding experience with them. As a result, they will be able to imagine how to participate in Catalyst concretely.

提案の日本語訳（Japanese translation of the proposal）
タイトル
『日本人の若い提案者を育てる』
問題提起
日本コミュニティの問題点は、Catalystの提案者が少ないことである。その原因として、日本人ADAホルダーの多くは一般投資家であり、資金調達に意欲的な起業家ではないことが挙げられる。
解決策
解決策は、私たちがモチベーションの高い若い起業家を集めて、育成し、彼らが次のCatalystに新しいアイデアを提案するのを支援することである。
関連する経験
私はブロックチェーン起業家を目指している学生であり、日本のコミュニティでCatalystについて講義をした経験が十分にある。
 
詳細な計画
問題提起 (詳細に)
日本はADAホルダーの規模に比べて、コミュニティへの関与が少なく、特にCatalystの提案者が非常に少ないです。何故なら、現ホルダーの多くが既に本業を抱えており、提案者として参加する余裕がないからです。加えて、彼らはステーキング報酬を十分にもらっているため、Catalystからの資金調達に意欲的ではありません。そのため、現状の日本コミュニティの中から新しいCatalyst提案者を増やすことは難しいでしょう。
 
解決策(詳細に)
日本人の新しい提案者を増やすためには、時間にゆとりがあり、資金調達に意欲的な提案者、例えば、学生を含めた若い起業家などを外部から呼び込む必要があります。しかし、現在、Catalystの存在は日本ではあまり知られていません。そのため、私たちがCatalystのポテンシャルを解説するオンラインセミナーを開催します。そして、Catalystに興味を持った若い起業家を集め、次のFundで彼らが新しいアイデアを提案するのをサポートします。
 
関連する経験(詳細に)
私たちは今年の7月にPretixで日本コミュニティ向けのオンラインミートアップを開催し、100人以上の参加者を集めました。そのミートアップで私は、Cardanoのポテンシャルをよく分かっていない方に向けて、ブロックチェーンの仕組みとADAの特徴をBTCやETHと比較しながら解説しました。さらに、私たちは東半球タウンホールミーティングに毎週出席し、Catalystの普及活動に努めています。私はそこで、Catalystの特徴とその参加方法について説明しています。そして、毎回40〜50人の参加者を日本のブレイクアウトルームに集めています。
 
提案のチームメンバー(役割)
市川一茶(リーダー)：早稲田大学生 / 2年生(セミナーの講師)
宮武俊明：IOG日本キャンペーンマネージャー(セミナーの開催)
Yuta：公式カルダノアンバサダー、Fund2の Catalyst提案資金調達者(セミナーのアシスタント)
市川雅男(私の父)：公式カルダノアンバサダー、コンテンツクリエイター(セミナーの監修)
Ranket：仮想通貨に精通するコミュニティメンバー(セミナーの監修)
*宮武、一茶、Yuta：セミナー後のサポート
 
セミナーの主なターゲットは若い起業家
私たちの目標はCatalystの提案者増やすこと、特にブロックチェーンの使用に興味のある学生や若い起業家などの提案者を増やすことです。主なターゲットを若い起業家にする理由は2つあります。
1つ目は、私は現役の大学2年生なので、サークルや起業家養成プログラムなど、学内にある様々なリソースを使って、起業家を目指す学生にアプローチすることができるからです。
2つ目は、若い起業家がCatalystにあるリソースを使えば、彼らが起業で成功する可能性が高くなるからです。例えば、Catalystは以下のリソースを提供することができます。
1, Catalystは提案者に対して、投資家との繋がりなしに資金を提供してくれる
2, Catalystは提案者のアイディアに多様なフィードバックをしてくれる
3, Catalystは提案者にカルダノのブロックチェーン技術を提供をしてくれる
などが挙げられます。もし、私たちがCatalystの存在とその使い方を若い起業家たちに教えることができれば、彼らは間違いなく提案者として参加するでしょう。
 
若い起業家をセミナーに集める方法
私たちの目標を達成するためには、Cardano ADAに少しでも興味のある人に幅広くアプローチする必要があります。そのための方法を以下に示します。
・オンラインで開催することで、全国から参加者を集めることができます。
・イベントポータルサイトからセミナーの申し込みをしてくれた方には、セミナーのアーカイブを共有します。そのため、当日参加できなかった人もセミナーの内容を見ることができます。
・今回のこの提案に参加してくれたメンバーは、日本コミュニティ内でも知名度がとても高く、多くのSPOとも繋がっています。そのため、彼らに私たちのセミナーの拡散をお願いします。
・私が通う早稲田大学には、起業家養成プログラムがいくつかあり、私も参加したことがあります。そうしたプログラムは、頻繁にイベントや講演会が開催されているため、そうしたプログラムとの連携も目指していきます。もし連携することができれば、多くの学生を私たちのセミナーに集めることができます。
 
ロードマップ(事業計画)
私たちの戦略は2つに分かれています。 メインセミナーは、外部からの新しい提案者を引き付けます。 そして、サブセミナーは現在のコミュニティを活性化させます。 それぞれの戦略の詳細は以下のとおりです。
・メインセミナーの開催
イベントポータルサイトとzoomを活用して、2日間に渡るオンラインセミナーを毎月開催します。合計4回の開催を予定しています。そして、最初のセミナーは11月に行います。各セミナーの終了後に、Catalystの提案者に興味がある人を募集し、彼らとSNSグループを作成します。そのグループでは、私やYutaさんを含めた提案の経験者が、彼らの提案から実行までを全面的にサポートし、Catalystの提案者数を増やしていきます。
・サブセミナーの開催と継続
1. 東半球タウンホールミーティングでの活動
私たちは東半球タウンホールミーティングにも毎週参加し、日本のブレイクアウトルームでCatalystの普及活動を行っています。今後もこの活動は継続していくつもりです。
2. 地方でのカルダノブロックチェーン普及活動
私たちは地方でのカルダノブロックチェーンの普及活動にも取り組んでいきます。既に徳島県の吉野川市の地方創生に取り組む、一般社団法人""Kittamu""さんから講演の依頼をいただいています。
 
KPI(数値目標)
・毎回50人以上の参加者を集める
(学生や若い起業家を含めたCardano ADAに興味のある人全般を集める)
・一度のセミナーで5人以上の新規提案参加者を集める
(新規提案を5つ増やすのではなく、チームへの加入を含めた提案への新規参加者を5人増やす)
・4ヶ月間で日本人の提案参加者を20人以上増やす
 
セミナーの内容
Prat1(1日目)：「ブロックチェーンとは？仮想通貨とは？」
・ブロックチェーンの仕組み
→クラウドデータと比較しながら、初心者向けにブロックチェーンの仕組みを復習する
・BTCとETHの特徴
→仮想通貨の代表例であるBTCとETHの特徴を解説する
・電力問題とスケーラビリティ問題
→BTCとETHが直面している問題について言及する
・Cardano ADAの概要
→これらの問題の解決策になりえるCardano ADAの概要を説明し、ADAのポテンシャルを理解してもらう
Prat1を見ることで、ブロックチェーンや仮想通貨に興味のなかった、あるいはマイナスなイメージを持っていた人たちにも、ADAのポテンシャルが理解できるようになります。
 
Prat2 (2日目)：「Cardano ADAの独自性と起業のチャンス」
・ステーキングプールと委任制度
→Cardano特有のステーキングの仕組みについて説明する
・Catalystプロジェクト
→オンチェーンガバナンスという新しい概念を説明する
→Catalystには、起業家を目指す人にとって、最高の環境が整っていることを知ってもらう
・ETH2.0との比較
→ADAとETH2.0の性能や将来性の差を説明する
・Catalystの提案方法
→提案〜資金調達までの流れの解説、そして実際の資金調達の事例を紹介する
Prat2を見ることで、仮想通貨に詳しい人もCardanoブロックチェーンの独自性を理解することができます。また、Catalystのポテンシャルも理解してもらうことで、学生や若い起業家を新規提案者として呼び込むことができます。
 
予算
・メインセミナーのスライド準備＝40時間×2本×時給1500円
・サブセミナーのスライド準備=30時間×4本×時給1500円
・メインセミナーの給料=2.5万円×4回×3人
・メインセミナーのスライド監修＝2万円×2人
・サブセミナーのスライド監修＝3万円×2人
・セミナー後のサポートの給料=20時間(月平均)×4ヶ月×時給1500円×3人
・オンラインセミナーの環境整備=11.7万円

合計＝117.7万円
↓
しかし、人件費の計算はあくまで見積もりです。また、一部のチームメンバーからは人件費の決定は後回しでかまわないと提案されました。そのため、提案リーダー以外の人件費はFund7以降に請求します。
Fund6の合計＝63.7万円
 
自己紹介(おまけ)
私の名前は市川一茶と言います。
私は早稲田大学の2年生であり、Cardanoブロックチェーン関連での起業を目指しています。私の父が公式アンバサダーの一人で、Cardanoのことは父から聞いて知りました。TEDでのチャールズ・ホスキンソンのスピーチを聞いて、私はそのビジョンに大きな感銘を受け、Cardano関連での起業を決意しました。私はCardanoについて数ヶ月勉強した後、現在はIOG日本キャンペーンマネージャーの宮武さんと一緒に、Cardanoの基礎知識を初心者向けに解説するプレゼンターとして活動しています。
この提案を実行する上で、私には強みが2つあります。
1つ目は、私は難しい内容をわかりやすく言い換えて説明することが得意なことです。実際に私が行った過去3回のプレゼンでは、参加者から高い評価を得ることができました。また、私自身が0からブロックチェーンを勉強したため、初心者が理解しづらいポイントなども把握できています。
2つ目は、私が学生起業家たちの抱える問題や要望に精通していることです。なぜなら、私自身が現役の学生であり、起業家を目指しているからです。そのため、私は他の人よりも学生起業家に適切なサポートを提供できると考えています。さらに、仮に今回の提案を通すことができれば、私の資金調達の経験をセミナーの中で紹介することができます。これによって、セミナー参加者はCatalystへの参加方法をより具体的にイメージできると思います。

Wkipedia with Monetization on Cardano!
 
Catalyst helps to form communities and drive innovation in the Cardano ecosystem.
If we want to bring proposers in from other areas, the best way is to bring the same solution to their domains.
Developing countries have huge opportunities to leap ahead in productivity, just by upgrading their technology to current standards. But resources and knowledge is often not available in understandable terms or their language.
What we propose is to start building an open knowledge base, like Wikipedia, but with the goal to replace patents as motivation to fund and curate our technological knowledge.
By crowdsourcing both prior art and infringement determinations, we can create a system where litigations are completely unnecessary, and instead help companies find the best available technology to help improve their products and manufacturing. 
 
This is very connected to my proposal for the Atala challenge, https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/BIT-Basic-Income-Token/367219-48088
Success Metrics
3 Months: We will build the core token functionality, as detailed in the BIT proposal. Publish progress reports on blog. 
6 Months: A prototype platform to publish and develop ideas. Catalyst integration?
12 Months: Integrate this solution in e-commerce platforms, that provide kickbacks to idea owners (affiliate like)
Budget: $6000
I hope to start developing full time for the Cardano ecosystem, on this and related projects.
Thanks for supporting my vision despite this rushed proposal :)

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


What is Innovatio Community?
The Innovatio community is aimed at entrepreneurs and developers in the services area, the community goal is to foster mutual collaboration, the emergence of new start-ups, and the adoption of blockchain technology to different business models.
The Innovatio community has a discord server, where members can make a brief presentation of themselves, self-assign roles (area of expertise), and start an entrepreneur networking.
On the server, you will find channels oriented to show emerging projects, search for collaborations, ask for help to solve a problem, publish freelance offers, blockchain technology adoption, business educational content, etc.
 
Catalyst's difficulties to attract entrepreneurs/developers from outside the blockchain world.
Project Catalyst seeks to improve the quality of proposals submitted in the following Funds and increase their visibility in the entrepreneurial community.
Currently, the Project Catalyst community is not attractive to entrepreneurs and developers outside the blockchain world due to the:
1) Lack of communities focused on the implementation of blockchain technology as a business value proposition.
2) Lack of incentives to attract projects and entrepreneurs outside the blockchain world to implement this technology.
3) Lack of simple and practical content/information to guide and attract new entrepreneurs/developers.
 
Key features of Innovatio's Community
1. Content and daily use of social networks to encourage entrepreneurs/developers to adopt Cardano Technology and join to the Community. (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
2. Interviews to Cardano community projects focused on showing the implementation of the Cardano technology as valuable implementation.
3. Community managers with general knowledge of the Catalyst ecosystem to refer members to other communities with different focus (Technical knowledge, governance, local DAOs, etc.)
4. Periodic activities in conjunction with other communities to encourage new proposals for the next Funds.
 
How will the Innovatio community achieve this proposal?
1) The community administrators will prepare daily multimedia content to be published on social networks, explaining blockchain technology and exemplifying it in real use cases, so the developers/entrepreneurs can see the potential and current use of this technology.
2) Discord community moderators will encourage the exchange of ideas and discussions of all kinds and guide members within the ecosystem.
3) The Innovatio community will be kept up to date with news on the development of Cardano and the activities of the other communities, to publicize them and encourage participation in the ecosystem.
4) The development of explanatory videos to understand the technology is very important to capture the attention of entrepreneurs/developers outside the ecosystem.
 
How does success look like?
1. Entrepreneurs and developers actively discussing business ideas and value propositions for both the ecosystem and the development of new start-ups.
2. Daily posts on social media to attract and engage new members to the community for promote and adopt the Cardano's technology.
3. Members interested in getting to know more Catalyst communities to get involved in the development of the ecosystem.
4. Periodic interviews with influencers and community projects to attract developers/entrepreneurs to use Cardano's blockchain technology.
 
KPIs
1) The number of verified members in the community.
2) Proposals submitted to Catalyst have arisen from the Innovatio community.
3) The number of mutual collaborations fostered by the community.
4) Proposals that have achieved success thanks to the support of the community.
5) Interaction and visibility of content on social networks and YouTube.

Please note: This is a continuing funding request! Originally funded in Fund4!
Please note: We did not have a chance during Fund5 to amend the Fund5 submission due to the closeness of Fund4 and Fund5.  We did receive overwhelming support for this project in Fund5. Sadly, we did not receive funding in Fund5 due to a lack of available funding left over in the proposer outreach category.
 
Goal:
The goal of this project to reach out to as many students/graduates as possible to raise awareness of Cardano and the opportunities that exist for both developers, professionals and business owners. We want to drive the targets to Project Catalyst and assist them in submitting ideas and earn Referrer fees (to be self funded). We also will deploy a website (request already sent to CF Foundation to request permission to use ""Cardano"" in the website name using a .org extension).
Addendum: A clarification, we plan to request additional funding for a few months until we can be self-funded. During these next few months, as we introduce student and graduates to the Cardano ecosystem, we hope to help candidates develop Catalyst ideas; Steer them through the process of developing ideas and refining them for submission to the project thereby earning Referrer Rewards. When this conduit matures, we will be able to sustain the project without further funding from the Project (ideally by Fund8).
KPI:
1. Number of people Engaged (200/day, responses, learning, referrals)
2. Number of people Attended (100/day Zoom/Twitch)
3. Number of Ideas Submitted. (30 per Fund, adjusted from 100)
 
Campaigns:
Social Media: Twitter, Telegram, Zoom etc. Daily Twitch Streams
Email: Lead Nurturing and CRM During lead nurturing we will continue to engage the targets by drip marketing and steering them to learning resources that will be helpful in ensuring their adoption of the ecosystem. A sample drip would include a short 1-2 min video with the learning resource of the day. A link to register to twitch stream/zoom call. A reminder email/text sent to the target 15 mins before start and at the start of the call.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano currently hosts large platform medical enterprises such as AskTheDoctor. It is my opinion that, if the stated goal is maximal adoption, it would do well to focus efforts on attracting independent medical practitioners and small practices. 
In my interactions with hundreds of doctors over the past seven years, and in particular within my close circle of confidants, a common thread has been the frequent expression of wishes to be free of the need to be employed by academia or large corporate practice, which increasingly represents the totality of available employers. The emotionally taxing and physically draining bureaucratic dehumanization one often contends with in these environments is no secret these days. Unsurprisingly, burnout is a scorching epidemic in the medical field, as readily available data in major medical journals (as well as copious personal experience) shows. The bottleneck keeping miserable doctors in their toxic circumstances is largely financial. In recent years, the business and regulatory environment of medicine has reached levels of such complexity and cost that the independent medical practice is now rapidly becoming an antiquated concept - to the detriment of both doctors and patients. Medical school debt of exorbitant principle and usurious interest is also a ubiquitous factor weighing heavily into these painstaking tradeoffs involved in taking or remaining in such personally unfulfilling jobs.
It seems clear to me that, if there were a simple way to supply a doctor the ability to ""hang their shingle"" via a direct to patient online portal, maximally automating all the complex and costly processes, with a published up-front startup price tag, the demand would be astounding. 
In this regard, I am hoping to now pursue the development of such a practice platform for myself. I am a physician in a position to ""take the leap,"" and I like the idea of it being an open and collaborative process, as this is a fundamental precondition for demonstrating proof of concept. Our strategies and struggles would be public information. Incompatibility and conflict with regulatory bodies is inevitable, and should be anticipated. With studied foresight, conceptual adaptation and continued growth is a feasible goal, as is maintaining the simplicity of the direct to consumer platform. It follows that successful execution of one such business plan, with concomitant execution of marketing and outreach strategies, will attract other physicians to take the leap, with the hopes of sparking a new front of novel, independent patient care offerings. 
I am aware there are many broad strokes in the above paragraphs, and many finer points and vagaries are worthy of addressing. I am open to further discussion and education.

Purpose of Proposal: WADA will host a second proposal workshop (follow-up to WADA Catalyst Conference 2021) in order to encourage and inspire people throughout Africa and the Diaspora to submit their projects to Project Catalyst for funding.
After a successful funding campaign in Fund 4 we are looking to continue with another proposer outreach event Spring 2022.
----------IMPACT-----------
How does the proposal fit into this challenge?
This event will be geared towards educating and engaging local communities to get involved in Project Catalyst as Proposers, Voters, and Community Advisors.
How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?

This virtual event will also be hosted in-person at three of our WADA hub locations. This event we will look to host in different local WADA hub locations to continue expanding our outreach (Cameroon, Nigeria, and Senegal).
Events will be made accessible via translation services in English and French as well as Portuguese, Spanish, and other languages based on initial sign-up interest and questionnaire feedback.

----------FEASIBILITY-------
Past Successes:

In August WADA completed a widely successful virtual and in-person Proposer Outreach event, significantly increasing our visibility as the go-to for mentoring and onboarding new developers and entrepreneurs from Africa and the Diaspora. https://twitter.com/jaycidiq/status/1432106218923888640

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardonex is a club for university talent from start-up hubs like India and many other developing countries focused on solving some of the most pressing issues in developing countries with the help of Cardano's Blockchain and instilling a culture of product creation through project catalyst. We are planning to start with India and then expanding further.
 
Key features of Cardonex:
1. Weekly webinars
2. Conducting workshops about Cardano's infrastructure and Plutus.
3. Creating Student Ambassadors for Cardano in their respective universities
4. Conducting Hackathons for Cardano's Blockchain
5. Project Catalyst guidance
6. Encouraging universities to build stake pools.
7. Dedicated youtube channel with all the recording of events, webinars, etc.
 
How Cardonex will achieve this?
We will be achieving our goals in phases with keeping a focus on fund 7 and fund 8 in the short term and overall expanding the Cardano ecosystem in the long run. We will keep adding more and more as our club grows.
Phase-1: Getting students from different universities onboard by conducting live webinars and Q/A sessions about Cardano and its ecosystem.
Phase-2: Conducting live trainings and workshops about Cardano's basic infrastructure, Plutus and Project Catalyst.
Phase-3: Organizing multiple hackathons in the Cardonex club and get them all ready for project catalyst.
Phase-4: Best students will be made student ambassadors for Cardano in their respective universities to spread further awareness, getting more and more students on board, and encouraging university management to build stake pools. 
 
How does success look like?
1. We are aiming to reach a user base of at least 2k students by the EOY.
2. We are planning to bring at least 3 proposals for each fund by the winners of our hackathons.
3. At least five student ambassadors in different colleges before fund 7 in top tech universities.
4. Raising awareness about Cardano and Project catalyst among students.
5. Bringing hundreds of skilled student developers to Plutus Pioneer Program.
 
Why are we the right persons?
We both have gained a significant amount of experience of the Cardano's ecosystem, from running a stake pool [SKRPT] to developing a dApp on Cardano's blockchain (deqree.in) and as we are university students ourselves, we are very well versed with the tech student community in startup hub countries like India. Also, we are currently having an outreach of around 10,000+ tech students from different universities all over India, some parts of UAE, Sri Lanka, etc. through different channels like Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Reddit, etc. as we all are part of an online degree program in India's top technical institute.
 
Roadmap
We will be launching Cardonex in October 2021. Our primary focus for the upcoming months is on creating quality proposals for fund 7 and fund 8 in project catalyst by skilled university individuals with all the phases rolling out one by one for each fund.
 
FAQ
1. India is very skeptical about cryptocurrencies then how is it possible?
A. Govt of India has clearly stated they are completely open and encouraging about blockchain solutions in the country, they are just skeptical of crypto trading due to high volatility.
 
Expenses

I would like to work with a Small Employee Incentive Company to build a Cardano defi app and create a whitepaper documenting the process.",+,"Thursday, 19 August 2021 17:26",Zachary Hunsaker,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Zachary-Hunsaker/3092961-48088,,,25000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The big issue that employee incentive companies have is ""bank runs"" that happen generally around the holiday season, this frustrates clients as the bills get much higher during those months. Using blockchain will enable us to create a workflow that when an employee receives a reward his/her position is calculated at the time of achieving goals and not at the time of redemption, this will make the system more sustainable than current models, and creates a more sustainable relationship between the incentives companies and their employees. Distributed systems also provide a level of audibility, integrity, and resiliency that is difficult to find in the small/medium sized businesses. 
 
After 3 months the problems that are best tackled by cardano technology will be identified and a paper about the process of discovering those challenges will be released to the community on a website I will build for this purpose. 
 
After 6 months the initial code for tackling the problems will be released on github for analysis and pull requests.
 
After 12 months the system will be completely built and a Case Study on the usage of Cardano in Small/Medium Businesses will be released. Including budgeting numbers, graphics, ROI, customer satisfaction, etc. 
 
Budget breakdown
2500 for dedicated machine for development.
2000 for project managers time to work with small businesses to define business problems and create a statement of work.

HEY CATALYST COMMUNITY!
It is proven that short, energetic videos attract attention and interest. That's why we're applying for some resources to increase our capacity to get people excited about Project Catalyst.
Have you seen our trailer for Fund 6 yet (see video above)? 
You can also re-watch the Town Hall Meeting intro from August 18, where we played it, as well (starts at 1:30): 
 

 
 
 
_______ I M P A C T _______
How does this proposal fit into this challenge?
Despite a very active Community around Cardano, Project Catalyst is still very unknown. Raising awareness about Catalyst through a marketing campaign will increase meaningful participation and attract new entrepreneurs from the community and from outside the Cardano ecosystem, which is the primary goal of this challenge 'Proposer Outreach'.
How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?
Currently Catalyst has about 30k+ members on Ideascale. The goal is to grow to 100k members by the end of 2021 (see town hall video of April 21st). This campaign is going to reach +250k views and +15k clicks and interactions. Therefore, this campaign will have a huge impact in reaching the set goals and will help our community to grow not only in size but also in quality, because the campaign will also support entrepreneurs to create successful proposals (see more details below).
Outlook and future challenges?
This proposal includes the possibility to apply for further funding in the future. Since the content (video and landing page) is already created then, the funds can be used more efficiently to leverage our contribution in order to reach the set goals (100k by end of 2021).
 
 
______ F E A S I B L I T Y _______
BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL ONLINE MARKETING CAMPAIGN
A successful online marketing campaign consists of two key elements:

increase awareness through great content
a strong call-to-action plan

Great content is the foundation of any online campaign. But the reach and therefore the success of the campaign depends mainly on the way in which the content is implemented and whether the attention can be turned into call-to-action. Therefore, the creation of content, the generation of traffic and the call-to-action part must be linked together.
 
CONTENT CREATION
1)Trailer
 A short 30 second video clip (see Fund 6 trailer)

Landing page

As Ideascale might be an overwhelming experience for newcomers, the trailer will link to a short landing page that will introduce the Catalyst process and also link to important resources like documents and other community sites. It also contains a strong call-to-action by encouraging entrepreneurs to propose their ideas on Catalyst and providing assistance to do so successfully. Furthermore, the landing page will give us the opportunity to measure and analyze the traffic which is important to run a campaign successfully.
 
CAMPAIGN STRATEGY
Great content will eventually be found organically, but we should obviously do everything we can to make sure our video gets the attention it deserves. That's why a paid ad strategy is important to get the reach we want. For this purpose YouTube ads are a perfect channel to raise awareness about Project Catalyst. This channel reaches 90% of internet users worldwide and has a very active crypto community. The given options for setting a campaign on this channel enable us to effectively reach our target group, because the trailer will be shown next to blockchain-related content. A further advantage of YouTube is the low cost-per-click ratio. And thanks to real-time tracking, adjustments in the campaign can be made at any time.
ORGANIC REACH
In addition, we as a community can share (post/retweet) the created video on other social media channels (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, etc) to expand the impact of this campaign. I also encourage the community to contact me if there are other use-cases for the video.
TEAM
Dominik: campaign management, story board
Experience: 10+ years in marketing, 4+ years as entrepreneur and business consultant
Website-link: see proposal description
Thomas: video creation
Experience: Conception, design and composting for more than 100 trailer for Animal Planet, Discovery Channel, etc
LinkedIn-profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaszuchtriegel/
BUDGET
The budget is divided in two parts: content creation and advertisement
 
Content creation: $2.610
Video trailer (incl. ideation, storyboard, effects, editing, cutting, sound): 30 hours a $45 = $1.350
Landing page (incl. content, design, hosting, SEO): 42 hours a $30 = $1.260
 
Budget for Advertisement: $10.080
YouTube Ads: $300 per day for 28 days = $8.400
Campaign Management: 56 hours a $30 (2h per day for 28 days): $1.680
 
 
____ A U D I T A B I L I T Y _____
 
ROADMAP
1 month after funding:
Voting results are expected to be announce at the beginning of November, followed by the launch of Fund 7 directly afterwards. As it takes some weeks until the rewards are distributed, we will launch an 'organic' Fund 7 campaign based on the already created trailer for Fund 6. Therefore, we will share the Fund 7 trailer on various social media platforms (Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.) in collaboration with IOG and Cardano Foundation.
2-3 months after funding:
In regards for the Fund 8 campaign, which is expected to launch in February, we will place ads yon YouTube in addition to the 'organic' campaign to increase significantly the reach of the campaign. We will also create an update for the trailer to show something new to the world. 
 
TRANSPARENCY
After each campaign, we will publish any figure that is related to the success of the campaign. This information will be available on public community sites (like projectcatalyst.org) and on my website (link in proposal description).
 
METRICS & KPIs
The goal of this campaign is to raise awareness about Project Catalyst among the Cardano Community and the blockchain industry. The following metrics and indicators will measure the success of this campaign. The targeted figures are based on experience and are to be regarded as realistic.
Media coverage:

Total views of ads: min. 250k
Total clicks: min. 15k
Landing page visitors: min. 20k
Landing page interactions: min. 250 (measured as subscription or using contact form)

Participation in Catalyst:

Increase the number of submitted proposals
Increase the quality of submitted proposals (average CA rating)
Total number of voters (registered wallets and registered ADA)

 
_______ F A Q _______
How do we reach the right target group?
Reaching the right audience needs to be carefully built up. The best way to ensure this, is to track conversions which mean that we constantly monitor the impact of different keywords. With the landing page as second part of the campaign, we can easily track with different metrics if we attract the right people. Also we are currently asking Ideascale what data they can provide us because they can see the activities of new users who sign up through our campaign (e.g. how many new accounts are created, etc.).
Why only YouTube ads?
Yes, there are other ways for online marketing. In my experience, YouTube and Google Ads are a very good way to start building a campaign in most cases. Results are easy to manage and costs are much lower compared to other channels. I chose YouTube over Google Ads because video content reinforces the memory of the content being conveyed much more than text or photos. And since we have already created a trailer, this will increase the effectiveness of the funding.
I will limit myself to one channel here because it takes time to build a campaign. Every campaign is different and you always have to check again the effect of the different keywords. If you don't make this properly you can easily waste money which of course we want to avoid. So if you divide the budget between different channels, the overall impact of the campaign will decrease because you have less budget to use the collected data and feedback for improvements.
How do ad blockers affect the campaign?
Many people are not familiar with the mechanism of online marketing. The answer here is simple: ad blockers don't affect the reach of the campaign, because you only pay per view or per click (depending on the campaign settings). So for example: Your ad budget is $100 and the cost per click is $1. Then YouTube shows the video to as many users as it takes to reach the 100 clicks. So if someone blocks ads in general, it won't affect the reach. It just means that you don't reach everybody. Which is acceptable, because the target group is much larger than our budget for ad spendings. In addition, this video will be shared on different social media channels. So eventually we will reach those people organically.

OUR MISSION
""The SWARM is a community-driven ""grass roots"" initiative, supporting Cardano in its mission to build a universal decentralized system that provides access to a global society and economy.""
 
CONNECT: We bring the community together to unleash its full potential.
INCLUDE: We build bridges to ensure the diversity of the Cardano community.
EMPOWER: We encourage everyone to act and lead by creating space to do so.
 
WHO WE ARE
""The SWARM is a dynamic organism. It is the result of its individuals and groups. Each new individual brings a new quality to the swarm. A healthy swarm is constantly evolving.""
The active parts in SWARM are categorized in three groups that are related to engagement, trust and endurance. The Swarm doesn't give roles, roles are rather establishing themself over time in proved participation. Example: How to become a bricklayer? By laying bricks.

Hive: Those taking the highest personal initiative and responsibility in the total Swarm actions.
Swarm Veterans: Highly dedicated supporters that have been constantly following the events over a period of time, taking action by hosting rooms and moderating sessions and discussions.
Swarm Supporters: Engaged supporters who are repeatedly active in meetings and discussions.

 
WHAT WE DO
Swarm operates and interacts in and around the wider Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals, projects and communities to Project Catalyst. Our activities are characterized by the following qualities:

Listen to the community and gather data and opinions from an unbiased perspective.
Host different events and meetups where the community members come together, share their ideas, connect, listen and get inspired from each other.
Reach out to underrepresented groups in the community, exploring ways to lower entry barriers and offer continuous support and advice.
Integrate local communities to enrich a diverse, multi-cultural Catalyst Community.
Moderate the community discussions in our events and Discord server in a way that empowers individuals to further engage.
Explore novel ways for decentralized governance within our community, based upon practice oriented methods.
Document and track our activity to build trust and transparency.
Reproduce ourselves by creating new swarm groups to have a diverse co-existence and collaboration of several swarms.

 
I M P A C T
Detailed Problem Description:
Town Hall is a weekly event organized by IOG and serves as one of the main entry points into the Project Catalyst. Town Halls are attended by hundreds of people every week and the recordings on YouTube average 2000-4000 views. Difference in YouTube views and live Town Hall participation is obvious. We see YouTube views as leads generated by Town Hall that we would like to convert to proposers. Currently, almost all of the Town Hall participants stay and actively participate in the After Town Hall events which shows community interest in this format.
Significant number of entrepreneurs and developers in other blockchain ecosystems are still underestimating or are not familiar with possibilities on Cardano. We believe that an interactive format like After Town Hall can be a great introduction to knowledgeable and constructive people within Cardano. We believe that these interactions can lead to significant inflow of outsiders into the ecosystem because we recognize the power of the Cardano community, as we have witnessed it on many occasions so far.
Detailed Solution Description:
We are organizing and delivering:

Weekly moderated Zoom Events with multiple, content dependent break-out rooms
Well established community moderators who facilitate breakout rooms and guarantee high quality conversations
Depending on the topic, breakout rooms visual support by the use of Miro-boards to help facilitate an engaged and lean discussion
Engagement of participants during the week by establishing communication to Newcomers
Tracking the progress of ATH growth & success of breakout rooms

We would like to add new things:

Professionals to hold breakout rooms on relevant subjects where they will present and answer questions from participants
Influential figures from Cardano and crypto space to present and engage with the community

Impact on Challenge and Cardano:
We want to include and onboard active participants of other blockchain ecosystems as well as provide a platform for people new to the cryptocurrency world. We want to demonstrate openness and power of our community because we see it as our most precious resource and a definite differentiator from other crypto projects. If we successfully onboard only a couple of entrepreneurs or developers, we expect the word to spread out quickly. By adding more proposers to Catalyst, we increase the quality of the proposals, we increase the ADA transaction volume and finally, the adoption of Cardano itself.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revisiting the Problem Statement
Voting is possible when deciding which proposals should be funded through Project Catalyst, but there are no systems in place for the projects themselves that allow for voting on and recording operational decisions in a transparent and immutable way.
Subjective interpretation of past events can cause conflict and dissolution, which in turn can lead to organizational fragmentation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introducing the Solution (How we address the challenge question).
A off2on chain voting mechanism will resolve conflict for self governing communities building on Cardano by creating an immutable record of agreed upon decisions.
By providing a frame of reference that moves subjective arguments to objective consensus we can encourage more meaningful participation in Project Catalyst from community members going forward.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed Solution
1) Voting Power
SecretDecks aim to introduce a tightly coupled on-chain voting system by minting voting tokens and distributing them based upon a SourceCred cross-reference.
SourceCred is a tool for communities to measure and reward value creation (https://sourcecred.io/).
2) Structure
The structure of the process will be a binary Yes/No decision option.
3) Mapping
These Yes/No decisions will be mapped to the SourceCred data
4) Presentation
Vote information presented on one page where vote can be made by clicking either ""Yes"" or ""No"" to initiate voting transaction.
5) Voting
SecretDecks members with voting power signal their decision with their wallet.
6) Results
Voting is tallied and results recorded & displayed.
7) Publication
Results are minted as an NFT.

Building an easy to use Google sheet based toolkit to offer the Vietnamese community an inclusive service to read, understand and evaluate submitted proposals in project catalyst.

Easy
Fast
Fair
Exact

Users can make a copy of the toolkit and start to evaluate.
Background:
We started to build, grow and maintain a Vietnamese Cardano community 4 years ago, here in Vietnam. Currently our social channels ( Telegram and Facebook ) include and inform more than 4000 Vietnamese community members about cardano and catalyst related news and content. One of our main goals is to include the Vietnamese community into project catalyst and to become part of a diverse and global community. Some very first steps in regard to including Vietnamese stakeholders in project catalyst, is to offer some easy tools with which the Vietnamese community can be included in the catalyst process.
One of these tools is presented in this proposal and we hope to get your support for our mission. providing tools and access to Vietnamese people to the Cardano ecosystem.

Bringing Catalyst to a Wider Audience
Even though Cardano seems to be well on its way to producing valuable content through the Cardano 360 and the various town halls we believe that content that is more entertainment and motivating, and available around the clock, would help develop Catalyst participation.
Video: 
Addressing the Challenge
This proposal has the aim of creating 24 hour a day programming seven days a week in several languages.
To address this challenge the initial content and focus would be on international Chambers of Commerce and various industry organisations where we could expose the opportunity for what we are calling ""crypto venture capital"" (CVC).
In order to attract projects and involvement from outside the crypto industry we would produce content outlining potential project ideas or use-cases for new industries to use Catalyst to raise funding and Cardano within their business.
This would also show how dApps and DeFi can be employed in their business or industry.
Broadcast Content
We would be Streaming programming about Catalyst past, present, and future challenges and projects.
We will try to involve as much information as possible about ongoing projects. We would also like to include Cardano news, Roadmap reports on projects and proposer interviews.
All streamed content would also be available on-demand (VoD), we would include multilingual translations including dubbing, closed caption, sub-titles and country specific productions.
We would encourage and accept user generated content, edited highlights of town halls, meetings, meetup events all re-edited post-production to create a slick broadcast experience 24/7.
We would create a broadcast control centre for programming allowing presenters to work remotely, this would be an Over-the-top media service (OTT) Available on any device connected to the internet.
Film & Program Funding
We would expand this into Crypto Film Funding for special productions, documentaries, shorts and full feature films.
The Monaco Streaming Film Festival
We have supported the team at the first international streaming film festival in August 2021 https://streamingff.com/ which was delayed due to COVID restrictions, in future it will be held on dates around Cannes Film Festival. We plan to build our involvement with this event and others due to be held around the world.

Co-operation and collaboration
We have noticed a number of proposals that are similar or in the same multimedia space, we will be reaching out to hopefully create many joint productions that can be incorporated into our programming.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We intend to create one educational video per month. 5-8 minutes long.
This documentary series is about the fundamentals of Cardano explaining the real basics combining real life experience and real life use cases where possible.
We are filming in the studio in Prague, Czech Republic.
The interviews filmed here are the main part of the project. It will be combined with some online interviews as well.
It will be bi-lingual: in Czech with English subtitles and vice versa.
Furthermore the educational content will be subtitled also into other languages.
We plan to test all this within the first episode that will be released in October.
The trailer and the first episode is funded by Adatruth, produced by Petr Smělík.
We are currently seeking funds for episode 2-4.
The first episode is featuring Cardano Ambassador Jaromír Tesař.
Watch the trailer here:

 
The format is structured as an educational and inspirational programme. The Cardano community and a global audience can learn about blockchain technology and about the unique approach Cardano brings.
The plan is to deliver 3 videos in total after the Fund 6 winners announcement.
The first one will be delivered in November, the second one in December 2020 and the last one in January 2021.
If the Blockchain Class is a success, we'd ask for more funds to create more stories in Fund 7.
I have a small crew of TV professionals who are working with me on the project.
 
Distribution:
The videos are distributed on our website via Vimeo and then organically to the viewers.
I need help here. I'm not a Youtuber, never will be. In essence I'm a documentary filmmaker and I intend to stay one. So I can create the content, but I need a marketing specialist who knows how to deliver the videos to a wider audience.
I still see the best option in IOHK's YT channel or as a part of Cardano 360. Not sure whether this is possible.
In the future I'd like to broadcast my work on TV but it's too soon at this stage.
Your thoughts?

What does success look like?
A strongly motivated team willing to reach out to a minimum of 193 countries and 500SPO's. Plan to inform and direct new participants towards providing a contribution that improves Catalyst's ROI.
 
Sustainable ADA will be focusing on all the language groups within the Cardano ecosystem and aiming to get a story written by a writer, at least one person representing each country in the world, and talking about their connection with Cardano, blockchain, and sustainability. 
 
We plan to provide resources for educators and activists to confidently introduce blockchain technology into people's lives; highlighting the sustainable advantages and positive impact to ripple and create meaningful impacts within the broader community.
 
We will be focusing also on Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), especially Mission Driven Pools (MDPs) as they are a group currently lacking broader spotlighting, with their stories told about their experiences and contributions to the ecosystem. 
We plan to have an article/interview with all the major alliances and their members and work our way through the SPO list once funded.
 
During Fund 6 Sustainable ADA will be researching and contacting each SPO group and alliance to get a database of contacts for each continent of SPOs so that we can interview, and write an article that showcases them and their alignment with Sustainability, SDGs, and more. 
We will also commence outreach activities with each national government in the world (institution, civil society, and more) to get writers ready and interested in joining the Sustainable ADA team.
 
Our Impact, Feasibility, & Audibility
 
Impact: creating global impact by onboarding stakeholders into the community with their stories and participation engaged. We seek to engage and involve the participation of Cardano's global multilingual, multicultural community in our Sustainable ADA news story telling.
Feasibility: We have global links and a globally diverse community that are supportive and open! If someone can visit all the countries in the world at least once, then we believe our proposal is achievable as we are committed and engaged community members!
Auditability: we will commit to sharing updates on the project through our social media channels like Twitter, Linked In, etc.
Host break out rooms in community meeting.  Sharing a page on our site with a countdown from our target of total countries connected with (193 Member States according to UN - https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states , we can go beyond this measure!)
 
Experience & Tools:
The Sustainable ADA team has experience working with Figma, Canva, Wix, Final Cut Pro, Da Vinci Resolve 17, Adobe CC, Microsoft Products (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc).
Sustainable ADA has the experience and a background in Sustainability, Economics, Humanities, Social Sciences. Along with work with NGOs, Social Enterprises, Freelance journalism, and blogging.
Sustainable ADA Platform: (https://www.sustainableada.com)
 
We plan on keeping track of our impact, while looking to increase meaningful participation from proposers, advisors, and voters through storytelling across the 193 countries, and the experiences from SPO's helping make contributions within and outside the Cardano Ecosystem.
 
Key metrics to measure:


Calculate the total number of new participants from different countries (sign ups on site, sign ups of newsletter, map of site visits, social media locations engagement etc)


Track % of these new community members who become community advisers?


Track % of these new community members who watch town halls?


Track % of these new community members who vote?


Track % of these new community members who proposes?


Track % of these new community members who become referrers?


Using our site, input forms, and social media channels to track the above

Use smart contracts to store customer reviews that are verifiably associated with monetary exchange. Experts build reputations they control.",2,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 06:17",Sam Gralla,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Sam-Gralla/3097990-48088,gabe.gralla,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/gabe-gralla/3100257-48088,5000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.
Our business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.
This approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services

COST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.
MATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.
TRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?

We solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. 
We solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a the decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.
Another great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.
The key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.
Technical approach
The web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.

Timeline
Development of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.
The definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.
The definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.
The definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!
Campaign suitability
Since our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal will support our efforts to customize Tutorchain for use with the Catalyst process. Interacting with the Catalyst community, there is clearly a need for expert proposers to connect with newcomers, but it is relatively disorganized (mainly some scattered discord servers and channels) and mainly limited to volunteer efforts. While we are all for pro-bono, community-based work, we think that injecting a modicum of capitalism may lead to huge improvements in results. We think a properly-incentivised expert marketplace could really help. The success of an expert marketplace relies on an initial critical mass of high-quality experts, good marketing to in-need learners, and good customer service to work out the kinks. We are requesting $5k to support these efforts for Catalyst.
Why should Catalyst voters support this project?
While the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good ""geek out"" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.
We think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common ""lack of developer buy-in"" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.
More information
We will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824. You can also contact us using the contact form on our website tutorchain.io.
We hope to earn your trust in this exciting experiment in decentralized grantmaking!

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Kepler SCS is building a business incubator for blockchain startups. Using the experience gained from supporting five Catalyst proposals by small teams, we will articulate and test a model with a set of guidelines to support the growth of other decentralized incubators in the Cardano community. Over the course of the next year, we aim to test a model for decentralized blockchain startup incubator and then develop a similar model for an accelerator. These models, together with an honest assessment of the strengths of weaknesses of our approach, will be shared with the community with the aim of stimulating the growth of a collaborative network of incubators and accelerators.

SNC Langbassadors create a series of 8 podcasts narrated in at least 10 languages, teaching How to participate actively in Cardano",3,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 04:07",Rik,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Rik/3069291-48088,,,9500,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Langbassadors have noticed that the best way to mass adaption is SSL : Simplify - Summarize - Lift the Language barrier.
We use white board animation videos to apply mind-mapping techniques that help understanding and remembering education given in our What is/ Why is ? program.
Most proposers in Catalyst have discovered ADA the crypto, and came for the money, then stayed for the Mission.
So to help facilitate Value onboarding the Langbassadors aim to make a ""How to ?"" series of 8 podcasts, but all narrated in at least 10 different languages all explaining the basics in simple language.
How to :

Create a Yoroi wallet
Create a Daedalus wallet
Stake on Cardano stakepools
Vote in Catalyst
Become a Catalyst referrer or Community Advisor
Inform yourself and get in contact with the Catalyst community
Submit a Catalyst proposal
Follow some strategic guidelines in entering your proposal

 
Check out the Roadmap on our SNC website and the Proof of Concepts already established during the Fund5 campaign we ended up getting funded for a team of 12 LangBassadors  for creating African narrated animations for a period of 3 months.
But the Langbassadors aim to bring our content in as many languages spoken in the world as possible. The languages will be chosen in function of availability of collaborators, and size of the respective language. We have had several candidates coming from the developing countries had to retract due to Covid, and also due to economic catastrophies happening there due to lockdowns. Our core team of hubs have actually managed to grow, and collectively more than 3000 hours have been put in the planning and execution of our plans
Language YouTube Channels already created with first native spoken content available are :

Arabic : 260 million people speak Arabic, biggest African language community 
Filipino : spoken by over 130 million people
Russian : top 20 world language
Luganda : biggest native language in Uganda ( country of 44 million people ) 

Soon to be launched : Dutch, French, German, Czech, Portuguese, Spanish and several other languages
For being eligible for funding any Languages will need to have at least 1 million speakers to be a candidate for translation, but priority in first phase will go to the larger Language communities.
The problem with Education is the KPI dilemma:
It's impossible to tell when the youtube channels will become popular in which country at what time :
that will depend mostly on : 

the Cardano foundation
where and when will the projected 100 million of Africans on Cardano by end 2022 and the 1 billion people on Cardano in 2026 be implemented
when will blockchain become a hot topic in a specific country

Now in order to do effective Crypto risk Prevention and education, one needs to have enough quality content available to become interesting enough to subscribe on : who subscribes on channels with just a handfull of videos ?
But given that creating our first What is ? animation ( duration : 4 min 15 ) , namely : ""What is blockchain ?"" took roughly 40 hours in combined efforts to create and translate and narrate in (almost ) 10 languages so far, it will take an enormous time to make sure the moment blockchain adoption skyrockets through Cardano foundation contracts the channels will be starting to skyrocket in subscribers because so far in many native languages there is hardly ( if any ) information available.

The Uganda LangBassador translating the script took 10 hours for the What is Blockchain ? translation in Luganda ( biggest native community in the country with 44 million inhabitants ), because many cryptocurrency concepts simply don't exist in those languages yet, so he is creating a new crypto lingo.
The Japanese, Arabic & Filipino Langbassadors took 3 hours to translate that same script.
The European Languages have help of machine translations as a basis so editing took on average 30 minutes for the same script.

It doesn't matter when exactly the implementation of the government contracts will take place, once the videos are created they will serve their purpose for years to come. 
So the question is simply : do you think IOG and the Cardano Foundation can onboard those hundreds of millions of Africans through Atala prism ? If so, crypto risk prevention and high quality education takes so much time that the Langbassadors hope there will be enough time to be ready for when adoption in Africa & around the world explodes.
And the fact that Cardano is now being promoted, and several Langbassadors Local Hubs are formed and growing, show the Langbassador concept works.
So as KPI, we intend to create 8 How To Cardano & blockchain podcasts , each in at least 10 languages ( Japanese, Filipino, etc... ) so basically we will create 80 videos in total in the 3 months of funding asked

Target 3 months : min 2 podcasts in 3 languages
Target 6 months : min 3 podcasts in 5 languages
Target 12 months : min 8 podcasts in 10 languages

Video editing , uploading, narrating and translating etc takes roughly 3 hours per European language & 5.5 hours for Japanese and Filipino and other non european languages. This comes to 35 hours to make an animation in 10 languages.
So 8 videos in 10 languages takes 280 hours for translating/narrating.
Script writing and video creation & project management takes roughly 12.5 hours per podcast ( roughly 5 minutes long ).
So creating the 8 videos itself takes 100 hours.
Total : 380 hours - all tasks renumerated 25 USD/hour, total budget asked : 9500 USD
Cost per podcast : 118,75 USD
Each of the collaborators on translating the How to ? videos is limited to 525 USD/month as reward with an hourly rate of 25 USD if the total time invested is less than 21 hours a month.
FYI : Commercially translations in European languages cost 30 USD an hour ( machine translation as a basis to edit ), and non European languages cost 45 USD per page since they cant use machine translations as a basis : https://blockchain-translation.com/pricing
Project launch date :
immediately after receiving of funding. All of LB Youtube Channels will exist at the start of this project

Have 2 google forms - one for newcomers and the other for experienced members who want to help onboard others.
The connection will be made manually, to begin with. 
 
When connecting the 2 buddies, they will choose the relevant form of communication, whether it be a weekly 20-minute phone call or offline communication, for example. 
 
The experienced member can help guide the new member and answer their questions, along with creating a meaningful personal connection that will leave its mark for a long time. 
 
Success after 3 months - at least 100 buddies have been connected and we can see a 20% difference between new members who have been attached a buddy to those who did not.
 
Success after 6 months - at least 200 buddies have been connected and we can see a 30% difference between new members who have been attached a buddy to those who did not.
 
Success after 12 months - at least 500 buddies have been connected and we can see a 40% difference between new members who have been attached a buddy to those who did not.
 
Ideally, I'm thinking the experienced members should receive a symbolic incentive - but am not sure yet this is the right approach. If so, every buddy should receive 10USD (100*10=1000 USD). Some more will go to the program manager organizing the buddies system to educate, match and improve the program. 
 
Public launch can happen within a month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Solution - providing a context to Catalyst-Swarm
The Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook has been recording the activities of the Catalyst-Swarm from its formation in April 2021.
The evolution of Catalyst-Swarm from Swarm sessions in April 2021 ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/april-2021/swarm-sessions ) through organizing After Town Halls from June 2021 ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/june-2021/after-town-hall#june-16th-town-hall ) to hosting Idea Fest in July 2021 ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/july-2021/catalyst-idea-fest-july-2021 ) is all documented in the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook.
The GitBook provides a useful reference tool for anyone interested in Catalyst-Swarm and its development and a valuable context for a community emerging out of the Project Catalyst experiment.  Catalyst Town Hall videos and slides are embedded alongside related After Town Hall ""open space"" events and activities. A summary of voting results for Fund 4 and 5 is included to provide further context.
In addition details of Catalyst-Swarm's evolving organization are documented in a governance section ( https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/governance/overview ). This aims to provide transparency and accountability to the community that Catalyst-Swarm supports.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this proposal
The aim of this proposal is to fund maintenance of the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook from November 2021 to January 2022. This assumes a single maintainer who collates materials relevant to Swarm and tracks daily activities.
The GitBook maintainer also regularly posts links to updated content on Project Catalyst and Swarm Discord Servers. In context links are also posted in Town Hall chat where appropriate.
A part of the budget has been set aside for marketing - so that the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook may achieve a wider reach and provide insights into Project Catalyst on social media.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Relevant experience (identifying information)
Stephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects. He develops, maintains documentation and provides technical project management support for Catalyst Swarm.
In Fund 5 of Project Catalyst Stephen's QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) submitted a proposal ""Quality Assurance DAO"" in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge that was funded in August 2021.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-whitenstall-166727210
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sustainability
QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) and Catalyst-Swarm are seeking GitHub sponsorship ( https://github.com/sponsors/Quality-Assurance-DAO)) and will also explore StakePool Operator sponsorship. The aim being to become independent of Project Catalyst funding. As it takes time to build up sufficient sponsorship - this proposal seeks to fill the gap.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintenance
Whilst the Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook content is open-source the maintenance is currently the work of @swhitenstall. The reason for this is the organizational overhead involved in sharing the maintainer role and soliciting and reviewing submissions from the community.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roadmap (Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months)
Prior to funding
Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - July 2021 to September 2021 ongoing
The Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis GitBook has been maintained since June 27th 2021. A presentation of the GitBook was given at Project Catalyst Town Hall #16 on July 14th, 2021 and is attached to this proposal below. Sponsorships are being sought.
3 months
Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - October 2021 to December 2021
Once funded Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis will aim to communicate its documentation and tracking via social media to reach a wider audience. Sponsorships are being sought.
6 months
Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - January 2022 to March 2022
In the medium term Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis aims to be self-sustaining and sponsorships will help achieve this aim.
12 months
Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis - April 2022 to September 2022
In the long term Catalyst-Swarm-Genesis should be self-sustaining and sponsorships will help achieve this aim.

.
The Current State
In Fund 5 there were 250,000 votes cast by ~33,000 wallets. This is a very impressive number but it is on average about 7 votes per wallet over all the challenges. (Source: https://forum.cardano.org/t/project-catalyst-fund5-voting-results-official/68424))
What do we know about voter behaviors? Why do some vote for all proposals while some vote only for a few? What else do we want to ask, what else can we know? What could we do with this information?
In order to fulfill the desired goals of distributed governance, we, as a community, will need to work to understand why voters choose to behave in a certain way. The best way to obtain this data is to ask them directly.
 
Our Proposal: Incentivized Voter Survey
The purpose of this proposal is to set up and conduct an Incentivized Voter Survey to get answers from a sample of the voter population. Ideally this would be an ongoing and evolving undertaking.
We aim at getting insights and a better understanding about how the Cardano Community sees, understands and interacts with Catalyst. This information will help all the Catalyst community to improve over time and increase the impact and Return on Intention of the whole process.
 
Roadmap and Milestones
Since the results of this survey will benefit the whole Catalyst process, we aim at delivering the results as fast as possible after Fund 6 results are out. The following roadmap sets some dates, but we are willing to anticipate them when we get funded:

Write and conduct Initial survey for Fund 6 results - November 2021
Promotion of survey - November 2021
Analyze results - December 2021
Produce and share survey results - December 2022

 
Example Information of Interest
Some examples of what kind of information we want to get from this survey:

What attracted them to certain proposal that they voted up and down?
How deep they get with the proposals before choosing their votes?
What is a 'no go' in a proposal?
How much weight they give to Community Advisor scores?
How much they know about how Catalyst works?
What did they like, didn't like about the voting process - how could it be improved?
Do they vote based on someone else's advice?
What other language other than English do you speak/consider important to serve in the ecosystem?

 
Team
Cardano AIM (Assembly Inspiring Masses) is currently made up Lucio, Victor, Phil, Razali and a number of supporters. We are all active Catalyst Community members and currently design and build tools that support the community. These include the popular voter-tool (https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/), the Community Advisor Tools (CA and vCA-tools) (https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool/#/ & https://cardanocataly.st/vca-tool/#/)) as well as the community landing page (https://cardanocataly.st/)

Phil has experience as an accountant, UI/UX frontend and graphic design and business advisor amongst numerous other pursuits. He currently has a lead position in the development and direction of Cardano AIM and is co-creator of the Community Tools.
 
Process
At the end of the voting process a survey will be released. We have set for this first survey an ideal of 200 participants. In future iterations of the survey we can obtain the statistically ideal number to have a relevant sample of the voter population - for now we are looking to test if the idea is feasible and if the community/voters will support it.
After participation in the survey the voter participants will receive a $20 participation reward paid in ADA (calculated based on the time of receipt from treasury).

About the project
The Community Landing Page (AKA Community Site) is set up to be a community operated, edited and developed site for the Cardano Project Catalyst Community. It's been in operation since Fund 3 and with successful funding in Fund 4 has started experimenting with voting on the community voted and submitted Github issues.
The Community Landing Page is designed to offer a launching platform of resources and tools for various stakeholders in the process: Voters, Proposers and Community Advisors. As well as offer information to the casual participant and interested person.
The site links to resources such as community guidelines, communications channels and provides access to data and information such as community statistics, fund timelines and official and unofficial community generated project resources.
The site hosts the popular Community Tools https://cardanocataly.st/en/tools/ 
that includes CA, vCA and voter tools. We are also partnering with Victor Corcino with generating and displaying community statistics. The related proposal can be found here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/368899-48088

Github & the bounty system:
The project repository can be found here:
https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io
We are in the process of building the bounty system, first conceptually, then by building a dedicated software solution. Currently community members can request features using issue reporting in github: https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io/issues/new
Voting can be done by reactions, as explained in this blog entry: https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/
Here is a list, we rank them by effective score, ""thumb up"" +1, ""thumb down"" -1, ""heart"" +2, ""rocket"" +3, the higher the score the more focus it gets, it might result in higher bounty, or changing the category of the bounty. Here is the list of bounties, if you have a github account, come and vote, help us!:
https://github.com/Project-Catalyst/project-catalyst.github.io/labels/bounty-hunter-needed
As the bounty system is implemented you'll be able to submit 'issues' requesting updates, content and fixes to the site through a dedicated interface. These will then be able to be community voted upon. Bounties will then be assigned to most relevant issues and offered to the community to resolve and be rewarded.
Set bounties can increase if not picked up by a bounty hunter. Ideally a cadence is set at the time the bounty is created, depending on it's urgency. In this way a kind of market force is offered.
The amount paid in bounties will depend on complexity and volume of work needed to complete. This is an experiential process and is under continual development and community discussion.

Auditability and tracking of the process is done and will continue to be done in a transparent way, although some of our goals are unspecific, because what the bounty budget will be spent on depends on the community.
Tracking
The tracking of bounties from previous funds can be found in this document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11vywFU4wEh_7aHnBwIL4NHKgXLYKu9MWurICNyloToM/edit#gid=0
We want to make bounty record publicly available on the website, we are also considering submitting the data to the blockchain.
Visitors
Site usage is another live statistic that we would like to include on the site. A KPI to watch would be month on month growth of users of the site. It's difficult to put a hard number, it depends on the growth of the catalyst community as a whole.
Relevance
Search engine results - We want to maintain our high results in search engines for relevant topics. We are currently on the first page of results, usually in top 5. We want to maintain our relevance
Efficiency
We would be looking at ensuring that a bulk of the funds got to community members from outside the steering team. However, internal bounties will be created when necessary and long term open bounties can also be claimed but the steering team to ensure development is continued at pace. At least 80% of bounties done by way of external bounties
Transparency
The setting of bounties is currently done by the steering team but will be explored how to adjust this over time. A bounty can be set in consultation with the implementer and room is viable for them to be adjusted should the estimated bounty be set too low. 
We aim to improve the transparency by providing reasoning for each bounty.
Engagement
We are activating community members and engaging developers, serving as a gateway into the ecosystem. If someone wants to contribute and earn some ADA, they need to learn about Cardano and go through the process of creating a wallet.
We want to engage at least 1 new developer per week. (4 per month)
Bounty Interface & Process
Deliverable: We want to have a well defined and documented bounty system with a MVP implementation so implementation of bounties is streamlined and automated as much as possible. This includes a way for the community to influence the bounty level (ADA).
User Satisfaction
We want to add a simple way for readers of the website to grade their experience with the website/ article and submit improvement suggestions.
80% user satisfactions score (4/5) is our goal.
 
We want to meet all our goals within th 3-6 months horizon.
Public availability
The site is already public, updates from bounties are applied as soon as they are done by the bounty hunter.
Bounty system is currently publicly available through github. 
Budget Breakdown
Internal maintenance/development payments up to (we will aim to make this as low as possible): $3000
These include things like administration, bounty setting, tracking, management of bounty hunters, general management of the site.
Publicly available bounties: $7000
These are the bounties that will be decided by the community, and solved by the community. A mechanism might exist where long term open bounties will be picked up by an internal dev team to ensure that the site development continues.

🔍 Details TBA
Goals:

Increase the representation and participation of an established worlwide arts and culture ecosystem - including queer, BIPOC (black indegenous, peole of colour), and female communities - into the Catalyst Community by curating the program with bookers from the UWS and SOU communities.

 

Establish a vibrant collaboration between UWS, SoU, an NFT maker project on the Cardano blockchain, and Cardano particularly the Catalyst Community. This will introduce Cardano to an established worldwide arts and culture ecosystem.

 

Execute a 'live-workshop' with three established artists and an NFT platform built on Cardano, - streamed on the United We Stream platform and Cardano Catalyst Community YouTube channel - in order to refine and create new proposals for other ideas.

 

Off-shoot profit contributions from the NFTs, closing the knowledge gap for mass adoption by onboarding artist and cultural communities into the - Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC) Hub - and furthermore into the Cardano Catalyst Community.

 

Live creation of unique 1:1 digital art pieces (NFTs) of which only one will be sold for charity and the others given to workshop participants.

 

Create 'local FOMO' and generate a higher demand for the live-created NFTs, and in turn a higher monetary return. Initially the NFTs would only be available to local participants. Then one NFT will be sold to a bidder outside of the workshop - 10% of the proceeds will go to the artist and 90% will contribute to the long-term redistribution channel (Virtual Space of Urgency, GADAC DisCO) built on Cardano.

 
 
 
Background/Overall Mission
During the COVID-19 pandemic, 'Spaces of Urgency' (communities including musicians, artists, labels, independent clubs and organizers, etc.), have suffered economically, becoming too dependent on government assistance. In particular, emerging musicians and artists in the nightlife scene have found it difficult to grow their fan-bases and also to reach wider, international audiences due to venue closures and a decline in international travel. Additionally, there are longer-term factors that precede the pandemic. For years, gentrification has threatened local, physical spaces (clubs, etc.) where musicians and artists have traditionally created and showcased their work.
Cultural spaces, musician and artist communities are under threat and require new approaches to support the growth and internationalization of their careers, and also to establish equal opportunities and fairer remuneration for their artistic and cultural outputs. In order to address the above problems, transparent, fair, nonhierarchical forms of self-organization and governance can help spaces of urgency - communities of musicians, artists, labels, and independent clubs and organizers - adopt disruptive ways of creating, managing, and disseminating their cultural goods, as well as the way these goods are monetized and consumed by audiences.
Since Space of Urgency and United We Stream are part of a vast worldwide network of established artists/musicians, organizers, and those working to preserve cultural spaces, we believe there is a unique chance to invite a few established artists/musicians to mint their goods in real time - or 'live mint' - with the Cardano Catalyst Community. Through this collaboration, other independent cultural actors will be inspired to become active members and join our Hub - Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC) - and in turn, the Cardano Catalyst Community.
The NFTs could include anything from music to commemorative tickets, merchandise, etc. The creation and distribution of these NFTs has the potential to create a sustainable social and economic impact, with the initial profits contributing to the development of a Space of Urgency Virtual Platform and GADAC DisCO.With the Alonzo hard fork and the full release and implementation of smart contracts, NFTs minted on Cardano will undoubtedly increase dramatically in the coming months. It's an optimal time to introduce a range of new, diverse artists and musicians to the Cardano Community, benefitting:
(1) the artists/musicians and other members of arts and cultural communities who are new to the Cardano ecosystem, and world of blockchain more broadly, by onboarding them via an established community and set of processes and protocols built on collective, decentralized innovation and self-determination, values that are also embedded in the cultural spaces and communities SoU and UWS work with; and
(2) the Cardano Community, by forging connections with a broader range of viewpoints and creative input, as well as amplifying Cardano's reach and impact with the onboarding of more established artists/musicians who will act as ambassadors. This will in turn inspire an even greater number of currently underrepresented communities to adopt Cardano and help it amplify its reach and onboarding potential. 
 
The Team:
We're a group of activists, community organizers, entrepreneurs, researchers, writers, and artists working together to establish a Global Association for Decentralized Arts & Culture (GADAC). Through this networked system and platform our aim is to both: 
(1) create tools for autonomous, nonhierarchical, self-organized communities to efficiently and fairly govern, track contributions (especially community care and pro bono work) and remuneration, establish scalability, etc. (detailed in our other F6 proposal, DisCO of Urgency); and 
(2) help these communities generate revenue via the minting and distribution of NFTs, thus creating participatory and/or monetary value (value onboarding). Through this different kind of redistribution structure, participating artists would also have the option to auction their NFT's and distribute ROI to arts and culture communities and the Cardano ecosystem.
After working for 10 years directly with artist and cultural communities, primarily those which have been marginalized by mainstream society and the status quo economic system, we've come to understand that new resilience strategies are needed - strategies that eliminate the need for government dependence and redistribution structures with little ROI. During the last years, we have facilitated substantive dialogue and debates and organized numerous conferences and events with interdisciplinary actors such as political agents, local governments, artists, and cultural communities. Establishing GADAC is a natural next step in the progression of our work.
Space of Urgency (SoU) (Liese Kingma, Lucas Counter, Heather Brown): Space of Urgency´s mission is to empower the visibility and resilience of independent cultural spaces and their communities, by sharing stories, knowledge, and tools for tangible solidarity in times of crisis. Expertise in designing and hosting workshops and knowledge exchange programs, and developing cultural community projects that bring collectives together, build trust, and foster deep knowledge exchange for social impact and community resilience. The project was founded in Berlin by a three-person core team.
United We Stream (UWS) (Anna Harnes and Danaja Volk): Expertise in marketing and global outreach media strategies for social impact. The broader project team includes six Berlin-based members. The cultural platform was initiated in Berlin in March 2020 as the club scene's response to COVID-19 and has since gone far beyond that to advocate for the preservation and sustainable development of club culture, diversity, and equality through streaming, partnerships, and campaigns. The global movement has involved over 2,200 artists in 117 cities. The Berlin-based association is the umbrella for the worldwide network of individuals, clubs, and collectives.

📊 Milestone plan TBA
 Timeline
Three months (December 2021 through February 2022)
We're planning to have all of the above-mentioned goals completed within three months after the challenge is successfully decided upon by the Cardano Catalyst Community.
End of November (27.11.2021)

Launch: The inaugural project launch will be at the Frei(t)räume (Envisioning Free Space) conference in Berlin (27.11.2021) - a nighttime culture conference organized by members of the Space of Urgency project in collaboration with United We Stream and the Stadt Nach Acht (City After Eight) conference. A focus of this year's conference is 'disruptive technologies', and will be our first moment to present the Cardano ecosystem (re: new opportunities) and our project to the cultural community. This is also aligned with our other F6 proposal, 'DisCO of Urgency'.

First week of December 2021

Community Calls: UWS and SoU have a network of over 2,500 Artists worldwide, who will be contacted and invited to a workshop about NFT creation. A communications strategy with targeted posts with visuals will be disseminated throughout the internal network of key players and the wider audience of UWS before and after the live stream, aiming for a viewership of at least 50,000 single click views by young (aged 18-35) arts and cultural participants.

Mid of January- End of February

External Campaign: To close the knowledge gap about the cryptoverse and especially NFTs. To provide the wider communities surrounding UWS, SoU, MitOSt (a Berlin-based NGO for cultural exchange and social cohesion) and Cardano tangible and clear products explaining the cryptoverse and its usage so the audience of the artists who will be interested in buying the NFTs gets the knowledge of how to do so.

 

Workshop: After that, three established artists (music, video, visual media) will be engaged to participate in a 'Live-Workshop' - introducing NFTs, the verification process, and discussing subsequent steps. - that is streamed via the international UWS platforms and the Cardano Catalyst Community YouTube channel. Additionally, we will have an interactive online chat. It will be moderated by two representatives from Cardano and Catalyst and two community managers from United We Stream, to provide community care with established awareness practices and answer viewer questions.

 

Expansion: UWS and SoU have a network of over 2500 Artists worldwide, who will be contacted and informed that the Live Stream NFT workshop for creating and handling their NFT will be held. A communication strategy with targeted posts with visuals will be implemented in this internal network of key players as well as into the wider audience of UWS before and after the live stream, aiming for a viewership of minimum 50,000 single click views by young (aged 18-35)arts and cultural participants.

 

Profit: The idea is that the artists could keep 10% of the profit of the NFT they produce while 90% would be repurposed for a long term contribution channel to aid the development of a Space of Urgency Virtual Platform and GADAC DisCO on the cardano ecosystem. These two instruments are designed to support artist and cultural communities and bring them into the Cardano Ecosystem and Catalyst Community.

 
 
After the three months:

Establish a collaboration with an NFT maker platform on the Cardano blockchain and give maximum exposure to an established worldwide arts and culture ecosystem. To ensure a sustainable feedback exchange between the artists community based on the educational workshop structured in collaboration with the Cardano community. This way the artists will be able to interact on the NFT Platform and integrate the NFTs into their creative process.

🦾 KPIs 
Definition of Success:
Internal campaign

Goal: To inform the global network and everyone we have been working closely with in the past years on the crypto-verse. In that way we can grow more efficiently and the community can adapt to these topics. Through this campaign the public one can also gain more traction since the internal community will clearly know what they are supporting and will also be able to explain and contribute.

 

How: By creating community biweekly calls month from December 2021- February 2022 with representatives from the networks of UWS, SoU, MitOst and Cardano community where these processes will be explained and questions will be answered. With each call the goal is to increase the presence of various cultural actors. All these calls will be moderated with awareness protocols developed by UWS and other partners. Everything will be recorded and then analysed by team members. We are aiming to adopt the concept of the Town Halls so the community will get used to this collaborative tool.

 
External campaign

Goal: To close the knowledge gap about the cryptoverse and NFT. To provide the wider communities surrounding UWS, SOU, MitOSt and Cardano tangible and clear products explaining the cryptoverse and its usage so the audience of the artists who will be interested in buying the NFTs gets the knowledge of how to do so.

 

How: By creating educational and creative posts on Instagram and Facebook released in the span of six weeks, to introduce the community to the upcoming workshops. The campaign will also be designed to be sustainable and long-term so that anyone could at any point come back and learn about these topics as well as share with their peers.

 

 Live-Workshop: executed at the end of February with three artists selected from the UWS and SoU network of 2,500 Artists worldwide, and in collaboration with an established NFT platform on the Cardano blockchain. The workshop will be educational and structured in collaboration with the Cardano community.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Eastern Townhall is a community-driven initiative growing Cardano in the Eastern Hemisphere and across Asia. We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:

We can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other.
Language and culture are not an barrier to participation.
We learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs.
Show how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing.
Enrich Cardano's ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives.

The eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano.
PLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE
Current Problems and Limitation
The Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.
The Team
A collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:
Yuta Yuta @yutazz - Japan: Cardano official ambassador, Community Co-Organiser, Catalyst Fund 2 Recipient, certified public accountant.
Yan Tirta @yantirta - Indonesia: Cardano Indonesia community wrangler empowering his local community with education and encouragement.
Mie Tran @mie.tran.0407 - Vietnam: English and International Business major with experience working with western businesses and translation.
Andy Sibuea @zicozibu - Indonesia: Leading blockchain education beyond cryptocurrencies and across Indonesia.
Tim O'Brien @tobrien - Vietnam: No-code pioneer. Facilitator in East African Townhall (EATH).
Greg Bell @grebel - Australia: IT consultant, writing Catalyst Challenges.
Seomon Blub @seomon - Austria: IT consultant focused on the people-ware infrastructure for sustainable communities.
Robert O'Brien @wolstaeb - New Zealand: Financial systems Software Engineer, Community Co-Organiser and Entrepreneur.
Stephen Whitenstall @swhitenstall - England: Tracks and documents Catalyst. Helping communities like Catalyst Circle and Catalyst Swarm organise.
Felix Weber @felixweber - France: Community Manager building bridges between people. Member of the T&M Catalyst Circle/Swarm/School.
The team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall trusted seed. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. We overlap and collaborate with Catalyst Swarm[1], and Catalyst School[3] and other community groups across Asia.
Proposed Solution: Pool of Funds
To reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture.
We are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:

We make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible.
We host different events where community members come together
We bridges to underrepresented groups
We integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and
We listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand.

We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.
Doing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.
This proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.
Simply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed ondemand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals.
In return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management[3] reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop[4] and FWB[5]. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out.
Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us.
Help us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.
KPI measurement method and goals:
A questionnaire on the number of proposers / voters / advisors is conducted for each **fund** in the community of the target country. The goal is to grow participation by 20% for each fund in the next 6 months. See our work on Catalyst Fund6 submission phase analysis[6] as a base line example.
Activities to reach KPIs

Daily: Inquiries from the community about Catalyst are answered by our members in their respective languages. We will translate Catalyst content and publish it via our website.
Weekly: We hold weekly planning events and meetups, sharing information about our activities with each community.
Monthly: Our spending is reported. We will manage your finances in a decentralized manner using a multi-sig wallet.
By Fund: Surveys will be conducted in each eastern community to count the number of voters, proposers and experts in each region.

Budget Areas

Attendance at weekly project planning meetings that activate Eastern Hemisphere: 20 people x 2 hours x 4 weeks x 6 months x $ 15: $14,400
Financial management, progress management, monitoring and reporting activities, other new member recruiting activities, etc .: $ 500 x 6 months = $3,000
Common expenses: Expenses incurred across multiple projects (domain name, hosting costs, Zoom): $1,000

Total: (1) ＋ (2) ＋ (3): $18,400
▲ Discount: $8,400
Billed: $10,000
Further funding requirements in future funds will be required to maintain KPIs that support Cataslyt's success in the Eastern hemisphere
We have already started this activity and will continue to do so whether or not this funding is raised.We gave a 45.6% discount to free up funds for a wider project.
NOTE: The funds directly required for each activity, such as East Asian entrepreneurial events in the Eastern Hemisphere, meetups, translation activities, theme setting and management, etc., are not in the category of funds required for this proposal.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


.
This is a side proposal to the Catalyst School
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School/367842-48088
 
The Catalyst School website will be a place to offer students a way to establish contact with resources, teachers and other students in an interactive way.
It will consist of an additional layer of features built on top of the resources to enrich the overall experience and provide different learning solutions using different methods and approaches.
The architecture of the website will not include resources and courses/workshops content: they will be stored on a public Git repository with an Open Source license and they will be accessible to anyone.
The website will include a mechanism to import in an automatic way these resources and content linking them with the features aimed at students.
 
Features included in the website:
- Import mechanism from Git and Markdown of resources / courses / workshops

Using a defined standard in the Markdown file organization it will be possible to parse and import the content in the website environment

- Courses and Workshops

Content and resources from the public repo can be reorganized in new courses / workshops
Getting feedback for oneself is very important, we want to build an initial quiz for students to self-test their gained knowledge.

- Quiz & Test

For each course and lesson it will possible to create quiz and tests that the students can use to self-evaluate their progresses and gamifying the learning experience

- Questions

Students will be able to ask questions through the website, contributing to the creation of a FAQ section for each resource.

- Events and Calendar

A specific section of the website will collect all the events related to the Catalyst School (like workshops in the After / Eastern Town Hall)
Students will be able to subscribe to an event in order to get updates
Events could be in a private form and created by the students to incentivize the creation of study groups

- Students registration

Progress tracking of specific courses (tracking by lessons completed, final quiz, test, etc.)
Follow-up emails and Mailing list
Creation of study groups
Certification -> NFT certifications with side-proposal

- Multilanguage support
 
Technical specifications
The website will be developed using the open source framework Laravel.
As described before the website will act as an additional layer of features for the students, and the content and resources will be imported / parsed and mapped from an external Git repository.
Therefore, the domain model of the website will include the ""imported/mapped"" models integrating them with all the entities required for the features.
Here is the Domain Model draft: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l-LVKTI=/?moveToWidget=3074457362542502107&cot=10
According to the last Laravel 8 guidelines, the website will be developed using an Inertia.js frontend implementation powered by Vue.js
The use of Inertia.js allows us to build a fully Javascript SPA (Single Page Application) frontend with Vue.js, without adding the usual complexity of keeping track of two different environments / projects (usually an API to serve data and a JS client for the frontend).
This will be particularly useful in terms of project development and maintenance.
The website will also include a public API, limited to specific resources (e.g. Courses, Events, etc.) which will be publicly available.

Experiment with NFTs as rewards for participation within Catalyst School to determine their effectiveness to increase engagement",17,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 04:49",The Catalyst School,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/The-Catalyst-School/3100487-48088,,,5000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This is a side proposal to the Catalyst School - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School/367842-48088
 
What is the Catalyst School?
The Catalyst School is a place to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles.
We help onboarding and help improving the skills of:

Proposers
Community Advisors
Veteran Community Advisors
General new Catalyst members

Our main proposal in Fund 5, with more details about the scope and goals of the Catalyst School, can be check here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School/367842-48088
During Fund 6, the Catalyst School has already helped onboarding more then 200 new Catalyst members in our live sessions and platforms (Telegram, Discord, YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPvRvMoxhmHLUuPPcsMmmg ).
 
Overview
There are plenty of ways to explore for trying to increase participation and engagement within the Project Catalyst community. Experimenting with different types of solutions will help highlight what the community values and give support to using effective solutions that drive the participation and engagement the ecosystem needs to thrive.
NFTs have proved increasingly popular across the whole of the crypto market. Collectibles of NFT art pieces started a large movement in the crypto space. NFTs are effective for scarcity, being a verifiably owned asset and can be used as a potential reward or gift for someone's contributions or participation within a community.
As part of the Catalyst School we want to experiment with NFTs as rewards to determine their effectiveness to help encourage meaningful participation within Catalyst School.
If successful the Catalyst School would then look at taking this approach and applying it to Project Catalyst itself so that as a community we can increase participation and create an even more engaging experience and an increased sense of belonging within the community.
 
Objectives

Increase involvement from students and motivate a constructive environment in the learning phases
Provide a form of proof that a student has participated in courses / workshops
Engage new participants using NFTs as an advertising and brand strengthening vehicle for the Catalyst School
Determine the effectiveness of NFTs as a reward system and whether it encourages the right behaviours and not ones that could be disruptive or distracting to the educational purpose of the Catalyst School
Determine people's response and preferences towards NFTs as a reward in the process of learning and participating to help provide a case study towards both Catalyst School and other projects considering a NFT rewards model

 
Initial NFT ideas
The following are some initial NFT ideas we are considering to use within the Catalyst School:

""Attender"" NFT - Distributed free of charge to all attendees of Catalyst School live events, such as workshops in the after town hall and Swarm sessions.

 

""Share the Love"" NFT - Distributed to students who bring people into the school through referrals.

 

""Catalyst Builder"" NFT - Distributed to students who help improve the Catalyst School experience by providing feedback and suggestions about the documentation, workshops or any part of the process.

 
 
Other potential NFT ideas
The following ideas are ones that require more reflection and time. We may use them alongside of or instead of some of the initial NFT ideas if we believe they may be more impactful:

""Top Learner"" NFT - Distributed to students who complete quizzes or competitions after a workshop or on the website. We are looking at where quizzes or competitions may make sense before introducing this NFT.
""Serial Asker"" NFT - Reserved for particularly active students (asking questions / offering new ideas and perspectives) during workshops or on the school's Discord channel. A key thought to this idea is whether the reward could drive disruptive behaviour for the sake of receiving the NFT.
""Perceptive Learner"" NFT - In the resources produced by the Catalyst School (documents / video / live events) there will be hidden links, unique for each resource, which can be used to obtain the related NFT. Where possible, like for the resources served by the website, these links will be randomly placed. On this idea we are still thinking how it may be implemented and also how we could prevent it being gamified.

Future scope
If the NFT ideas are successful within Catalyst School we would look at exploring the following areas to produce some NFTs as a reward. We would be looking to help Project Catalyst and helping with the following type of participation and engagement:
Proposers

Creating quality proposals
Increasing collaboration and combining proposals or teams when that makes sense

Community advisors

Leave quality assessments
Complete more assessments

Voters

Read proposals thoroughly and vote on what will help grow and improve the ecosystem
Delegate their vote to an expert to help ensure votes are used well

Auditability

Open source repository for any development and the process used to mint and integrate the NFTs as a reward system
A completion report with our findings from the feedback for the reward system looking at whether it had any meaningful impact to community engagement

 
Development roadmap & milestones
1 month after funded:

Document the reward process for School members to understand the reward system
Finalize the NFT selection and process for distribution

2 months after funded:

Produce graphic designs for NFTs
Mint NFTs
Open source any development work or minting process used to create NFTs

3 months after funded:

Integrate the NFT reward system in fund 7 workshops and any courses
Issue NFTs over the the course of a future Catalyst School funding round and gather feedback to measure against KPIs

 
KPIs

Percentage of students who request to have the participant NFT after completing a workshop
Number of students who had heard about the NFT reward system before joining a workshop or course
Asking students to rank the reasons they joined the Catalyst School and ensure NFTs is part of that list to determine what the key drivers were for their involvement.
Which NFT rewards the students were interested in receiving.
What other areas in Catalyst School or Project Catalyst that students think should also receive rewards and whether they believe NFTs were a suitable solution after receiving them.

 
Budget

NFT minting and distribution - $2,000
NFT Design - $1,500
Management and admin - $1,500
Total: $5,000

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Many things in the Cardano Catalyst project are difficult to understand and hard to explain. Significant thought needs to go into complex concepts to break them down and to communicate them simply. By doing this process and presenting the outcome in nice easy to consume media the community will be able to better on board new members and help them achieve their meaningful participation fast.
 There are three graphics that I'd like to undertake in the first run of this Cardano Aim Education series. They are Voting Explained, Catalyst Explained & Challenge Setting Explained. However for this fund we will create polished version of voting explained (an extension of the draft example video above) and Challenge Setting Explained as these two are the topic in most need of explaining to new community members.
If successful I will look to keep expanding the series over the coming months by seeking additional funds to offer more education material.
The material will be publicly available on the Cardano AIM YouTube channel and could be useful in initiatives such as the Catalyst School and wider.
Team:
Phil has a detailed knowledge of the Catalyst ecosystem being an active CA, proposer and advisor. He has teaching experience and video production. He is a member of the Cardano AIM team and has a number of other proposals for consideration. He will partner with a motion designer who will carry out the design and animation work.
Cardano AIM members will offer support and advice as necessary.
Time Frame:
4-6 weeks for each video. Delivery will depend on existing work load and start time will depend also on workload of the designer. The aim would be to deliver two to three months from funding.
Metrics
YouTube views, comments, & likes
Budget:
Motion Graphic animation: $2500 x2
Montage/edit: $500 x2
Scripting and concept creation: $500 x2
Voice recording and editing: $500 x2

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Challenge Objective: Growth of meaningful participation from proposers advisors and voters.
 
Problem Expanded:
The catalyst community is growing fast and the amount of information a new member needs to grasp can be overwhelming and time-consuming, which limit members' involvement. Education resources are very helpful and important but many times people learn more by actually doing tasks.
Let's make it easier for newcomers (and members in general) to participate and support the community efforts.
 
Solution Expanded:
The idea is to help members engage and support proposals as well as communicate with other members. To do this we will create a simple mechanism that matches members' profiles with tasks. 
 
Benefits: 
The matching platform will increase the support points between members, proposals, and catalysts. It will reduce the time that passes between a member registration and actual support and will make members feel they are contributing to the community and being an important part of it.
 
Examples for tasks:
Task 1: Catalyst advisor.
Between 30-50 hours per fund cycle, entrepreneurial experience, CA compensation
Task 2: Proposal partner.
B2C social media expert, 50% capacity once winning the proposal, part of proposal budget
Task 3: Brainstorming session about the proposal tech development.
1 hour, a blockchain developer
Task 4: Graphic designer.
3 hours, design a ppt
Task 5: Network connection.
For proposals looking for pilot leads with school teachers in Ethiopia, 10 min.
Task 6: Legal support.
an international lawyer, one hour per week, support proposals
 
Catalyst related Tasks will be also included to promote key catalysts matrics such as become a referrer, community advisor, proposer, and any other tasks that catalysts wish to promote and to engage the members
A good example of such a process could be found on GivingWay.com website in the volunteer section which resulted in a significant increase in online volunteering. GivingWay CTO will be advising on this proposal.
https://www.givingway.com/search.give?searchMode=online
Check out causes and tasks - which is an initial search for online volunteer opportunities.
 
Solution includes
1. a task generator - how to integrate generating tasks in the IdeaScale proposal process or for projects
2. tasks center - where all tasks are presented and can be filtered
3. Members expertise - the key points where members could add their expertise and availability
4. communication between members and tasks owners will be using the Catalyst messaging system
5. mutual feedback process between members and proposals (this will be developed in the next phase)
 
In phase 1 we suggest presenting how this solution could be integrated into the Ideasacle platform which is the main platform to manage proposals for Catalyst.
In addition, there are some great community-led projects that provide valuable services for the community and that are very open to integrating new added-value solutions. Here are the platforms we had discussions with:
PACE team https://projectcatalyst.org/community
AMI team https://cardanocataly.st/en/tools
Roadmap:
The main tasks are to develop a working mechanism that will include the tasks generator, tasks center, and members' expertise profiling and integrating it into Ideasacle or/and other community platforms. Ideascale platform already includes the member's registration and has communication features between members and proposals which will make the integration easier.
 
1. research and analysis of the key potential tasks. It will include sending a questioner to proposals and collect feedbacks - week 0 - week 2
2. Analysis of how best to integrate the task generator, task center, and member expertise in the idea scale process - week 0 - week 2
3. UI process for members profile, tasks, and task center week 2 - week 4
4. Development, QA, UI improvements - database, filter & search, task generation week 4 - week 8
5. Run test use case week 8 - week 12 with adjustments and fixes
6. Present results and approve integration with IdeaScale or and other platforms
*0 to be when resources are available
 
How does success being measured:
The objective of the challenge is to meaningful participation and the KPIs therefore
# of tasks being generated
# of community members adding expertise and availability to their profile
# of clicks by members on tasks
# of matching between profiles and tasks
# of actual tasks done related to proposals
# of actual tasks done related to catalyst
 
Promotions:
The solution is done for a very captive audience which is the proposal owners and the community members.
For the task generation, the objective is already to include it in the proposal process. For the members, it could be included in the onboarding, part of the profile setting, and in various communication channels of the community such as Telegram and Townhall sessions under a tag line ""how can I help"" or ""how can I support proposals"".

Budget:
The timeframe for this proposal will be 3 months and will require interactions with Ideascale and Catalysts teams
Here is the detailed plan:
Project manager: USD 1,500 per month for 3 months (about 25% position per month with a moderate salary for EU standards). Total $4,500
UI - UX including design USD 1,500 per month for 3 months (about 25% position per month with a moderate salary for EU standards). Total $4,500
Technical team member USD 1,500 per month for 3 months (about 25% position per month with a moderate salary for EU standards). Total $4,500
Total Budget = $13,500
Requested funds in USD 13,500
 
Challenges:
There will be challenges on the way to success, here are some:
Challenge 1 - integration to IdeaScale
The integration should be fairly simple, but integrating with a third party always holds some risk as not all depend on your side. We count on Catalyst to support us in this process once the community approves the proposal.
 
Challenge 2 - getting attention from the community
This will be a key challenge and key success factor as we need to attract new members or members that are less active 
 
Challenge 3 - getting right the UI and communication
The UI for tasks as well as for member profiles is very important to make sure the process gets adoptions. Making it simple and easy to use
 
Challenge 4 - ongoing solution
The solution might required upgrades, improvements, and integration with the multiple Catalyst platforms which might require additional funding which based on the success could be as part of future funds or maintained by the Catalyst team.
 
Summary:
This proposal aims to better connect members and especially new members to participate and take action. Connect members directly with tasks will lead to feeling useful and part of the community for many more successful engagements.
 
Thank you for taking the time to evaluate the proposal. We welcome any feedback, questions, and suggestions. We also welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the success of the venture. We appreciate the CA, VCA, and voter's time and attention.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


.
The Catalyst School: what is it all about?
The Catalyst School is a place created to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles. We onboard new members and help improving their skills along the way, in any way they decide to engage with Catalyst: as a Proposer, a Community Advisor, a Veteran Community Advisor or without any specific role within the process. In order for Catalyst to flourish and reach its full potential, all these roles need to give their best contribution within the process.
We understand that different people prefer different learning methods. Therefore, the School aims to help the community through:

Live sessions and workshops.
1-to-1 and group support in many different languages.
Interactive website.
Other workshops related to Catalyst.

Today, the main topics covered by the Catalyst School today are:

Introduction to Catalyst
Proposing in Catalyst
How to be a Community Advisor
How to be a Veteran Community Advisor

 
What is the School already doing?
The Catalyst School is already helping the community since the beginning of Fund 6. We are doing that so we can receive feedback from the community and improve our teaching methods and content so we reach the highest Return on Intention we can.
You can check our announcement during a Catalyst Town Hall here:

We have already run several sessions about the main topics described above, and onboarded more than 200 new Catalyst members. Some of these sessions were recorded and are now available in our YouTube channel:

Introduction to Catalyst:

Proposing in Catalyst:

How to be a Community Advisor: 

Catalyst School YouTube channel:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPvRvMoxhmHLUuPPcsMmmg

We have also already ran workshops during the Catalyst Eastern Town Hall and the WADA Conference 2021.
And since the beginning of Fund 6, we are also providing support to the community through some different platforms:

Telegram: https://t.me/TheCatalystSchool
Discord: https://discord.gg/nqxRY59TSp
Twitter: https://twitter.com/school_catalyst

 
Why do we need the Catalyst School?
Catalyst is not a traditional funding platform, it has its own protocol and method of functioning. Therefore, anyone who wants to join this experiment needs to learn about it first.
Until today, learning about Catalyst, how it works, its requirements and the criteria to succeed according to one's role is still not so easy because the relevant information and resources are not easily digestible and findable, in one hub known to newcomers and veterans alike.
There is also no platform to bring together those who are in the process of learning about Catalyst, be them newcomers or veterans, so they can exchange knowledge and help each other.
 
Our Partnerships
As the saying goes, if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go together! With that in mind, Catalyst School will collaborate with other educational stakeholders in the Catalyst ecosystem, building bridges to maximize synergistic optimum impact.
The Catalyst School already has partnerships with:

Gimbalabs ( https://gimbalabs.com/ )
WADA ( https://wadalliance.org/ )
Eastern Town Hall ( https://discord.gg/4xnCdV6Qrn )
Tutorial for Community Advisors ( http://app.ideascale.com/t/UM5UZBiSh )

 
Our basic Website
The Catalyst School will include a basic website consisting of two main parts:
- Gitbook

All the content and the resources used for the Catalyst School will be published in a public Git repository with an Open Source license and presented to the users through Gitbook (https://www.gitbook.com/), a platform for publishing documentation.

- Landing page
The landing page will include:

A subscription form to collect students and engage them with periodical emails and resources
A visual index to helps users navigating through all the resources published in the GitBook
A basic quiz about the ""Introduction to Catalyst""

Link to the Miro Board: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l-LVKTI=/?moveToWidget=3074457362364829276&cot=14
 
The Plan: Roadmap and Milestones
This proposal aims to provide the School sessions, workshops, 1-to-1/group support (in English) and a basic website. When funded, we will provide all these services for the next 2 Funds (Funds 7 and 8).
School Sessions and workshops are planned to be hosted during After Town Halls (every Wednesday) and during Swarm Sessions (every Saturday). Also, the sessions are going to be synchronized with each phase of Project Catalyst, so we increase the value delivered by them.
Our goal is to provide 20 sessions in each Fund, following the Project Catalyst schedule. Therefore, our roadmap (per Fund) is:
 
- Week 1 - Insight Sharing Phase:

2 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)

- Week 2 - Proposal Submission Phase:

2 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)
2 x Proposing in Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)

- Week 3 - Proposal Refinement Phase:

2 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)
2 x Proposing in Catalyst (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)

- Week 4 - Proposal Finalize Phase:

1 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall)
2 x How to be a Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)

- Week 5 - Proposal Assessment Phase:

1 x Introduction to Catalyst (After Town Hall)
2 x How to be a Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)
2 x How to be a Veteran Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)

- Week 6 - Assessments Review Phase:

2 x How to be a Veteran Community Advisor (After Town Hall and Swarm Session)

 
Besides that we aim at providing 30 1-to-1/group support sessions in each Fund. Therefore, in total we will provide a total of 60 support sessions. Each support session will be 30 mins long, and we will encourage individuals who ask for support to make it a group support, so more community members can benefit from them.
 
-> This road map and sessions/workshops schedule can be adapted and changed based on community feedback and needs.
 
Therefore, our milestones and success definition are:
3 months after funded (end of Fund 7):

Learning content created for the School sessions and workshops.
School basic website up and running.
20 School sessions and workshops hosted.
30 1-to-1/group supports provided

6 months after funded (end of Fund 8):

Further 20 School sessions and workshops hosted.
Further 30 1-to-1/group supports provided.

 
Success metrics
We will track the success of this project by measuring the:

Total number of community members who get involved with the Catalyst School.
Number of proposers joining the sessions and workshops.
Number of CAs joining the sessions and workshops.
Number of vCAs joining the sessions and workshops.
Number of 1-to-1 supports provided to community members.
Number of new referees
Number of new voters

The Current situation
In our current wallet software utility and education are separated, creating a barrier for people to enter and to trust the crypto space and Cardano.
The Frustration
Do you recognize this? ""Hey, friend. How do I buy ADA? How much does it cost? Where can I buy ADA?"" YES, we all do and it feels good to help friends and family enter the crypto space, because we all believe that ADA will change the world. But it's not our job to be a crypto wizard and what if our information is not up to date or even incorrect?
The Future Desire
By using digital conversation through a virtual assistant in a Cardano Wallet we can combine utility and information to create a more user friendly and trustworthy experience through interactive content, because ADA holders will be able to retrieve relevant information directly through a trusted wallet. In this proposal we will use Daedalus/Yoroi/Nami wallet features as examples to rebuild digital conversations.
 
Exponential Growth needs a scalable, safer, and natural interface solution.
Cardano´s market cap nearly doubled in February and August of 2021 (statistica.com). A lot of people entering the crypto market are new users and it will be pivotal for the success of Cardano. Digital Conversations support new ADA holders as well as current ADA holders in their abilities to perform the necessary actions to navigate the crypto market as well as to support proof of stake and voting through providing relevant information.
Currently, (new) users have to look up information through a variety of sources and some of them might not be providing accurate information. By distributing information directly into Cardano Wallets, we´ll be able to cut out unreliable sources and enhance trust and knowledge with every person holding ADA. 
Rebuild Wallets as Virtual Assistants 
What if we reinvented Cardano wallet so that it facilitates utility, user friendliness and education as a virtual assistant. If we want to see the Cardano Network grow, to be a highly technical but at the same time a user friendly environment, we should utilize the diversity of Catalyst in the process. We´re looking to get together digital product designers, educators, developers, front end designers and the whole range of our diverse community in a series of UX/UI workshops to create the best user experience possible.
Virtual assistants or conversational agents are software applications enabling users to interact with a smart device through natural language, often with the goal of helping a user to provide information and complete tasks. If applied to the DAEDALUS wallet, a virtual assistant would respond to questions of any user with different experience levels at any given time in any language in a chat-like format.
Who Is This Proposal For?
The Social UX Workshops are for the Project Catalyst community to help:

ADA-holders/Voters who want to use a trustworthy method to onboard their family and friends into the cardano ecosystem.
Proposers that conceptualize and build Virtual Assistants/Digital Conversations for their Cardano Projects.
Proposal implementers; build and train Cardano digital product designers in using the lego toolkit for Cardano Digital Conversations.
Cardano Wallet builders; build and train Cardano wallet teams in building digital conversations and conversational interfaces.
Refers; Create a trustworthy entry point for a family-member or friend who would benefit from joining the Cardano ecosystem.

 
What does success look like within 3-6 months?

We Convinced two Cardano wallet teams that digital conversations delivered through trusted wallets are the key to scaling Cardano onboarding for non-tech family and friends.
We co-created the Onboarding Storyboards for Family & Friends with the Cardano Community (Design with, not for ...)
We onboarded 20 Digital product designers from outside Catalyst.
We doubled the Social Design Academy Discord from 50 to 100 members; Passionate digital product designers that want to co-design and build natural conversational interfaces for cardano/catalyst projects.
We built the SocialDesignAcademy.io website and launched our first Social UX course.

This Proposal will improve the following challenge metrics:
Increased meaningful participation; By introducing a new social design system we enabled the Cardano/Catalyst community to build quicker, safer and more natural designs at scale. We are building a conversational participation network instead of silo-ed apps.
Engagement & Retention; We have proven that digital conversations intrigue people, and are an effective method to scale the Cardano narrative in a safe environment.
Iterative & Trustworthy interactive content; In contrast to page-based software design, digital conversations can be easily iterated, are flexible and can be linked to conditions, we track the efficacy of conversational scripts with UX KPI's. 
Proof of Inclusion and diversity; We successfully showed that we are able to co-design open-source conversational modules with the Cardano Community and interactive content translations can be a community effort.
Conversation Design & Cardano Command line interface; We have proven that digital conversations are a better match for the (changing) Cardano CLI than page-based design.
 
Impact - Benefits of Conversational Onboarding are:

Applications are repetitive, harsh and telling people what to do. Assistants ask, and deliver chat-based conversations that transform static software into a proactive and hospitable ecosystem.
Link conversational scripts to notifications to motivate people into action.
Chats surprise people, build relationships and guide people to new possibilities.
Assistants make it easy to summarize what happened since the last time you visited.
Building Assistants simplifies the technology stack, can control the cli for advanced cardano features, chat-like interactions are flexible, makes a/b testing a breeze, is fun and enables teams to design with emotional intelligence.
An open-source Conversational Lego Toolkit is the start for the no-code conversational solution, is responsive by default, and is the start of chat-based governance.
A new Social Appstore in which people can download new conversational scripts into their Cardano Wallet gives Cardano an immense competitive advantage.
Align intent, purpose and meaning and create mission driven design challenges.
The logical step towards Voltaire Assistant (Assist proposers, support reviewers, start using ADA in the ecosystem, stop Catalyst treasury from leaking into dollars, etc.)
Digital conversations scale the Cardano ecosystem and create a trustworthy and hospitable environment.

 
Feasibility - How do we make sure we deliver on intent?

By keeping this a design education project we will create a visual showcase and interactive design, validating the chat-like onboarding with the Cardano/Catalyst community.
We'll use Social UX Toolkit exercises to systematize our approach toward chat-based interactions in our Cardano Wallets.
Niels is a design and workshop facilitator, and has 15+ experience in digital design, he is on a mission to introduce chat based governance to the Catalyst Ecosystem.
We'll use motion graphics design software (After Effects) to fine tune timings of functional animations (Motion must feel snappy, concise, and secure.)
Social design exercises enable others in the cardano ecosystem to apply the same conversation design methods to their projects.
We'll invite existing cardano projects into social design workshops.
We'll validate and ask feedback from the Catalyst community.
We'll index experience gaps with Social UX exercises.
We'll overcome risk by pre-prototyping experience maps. Join our Discord to learn more.
We'll humanize our Wallet software by combining utility, education and usability.
By growing our Social Design Academy in discord we build a conversation design movement that mitigates risk by diversifying perspectives. (https://discord.gg/BFsrbRgMMF)
We'll review and present progress/design sprints regularly to the community.
We'll do UX research with family and friends with a proof of concept.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Pritesh is a Cardano enthusiast and ambassador, who has spent several years creating content for the Cardano Community. The platform being proposed would contain content that provides value to the Catalyst Community. With how-to videos showing the process to register and give kudos on proposals, all the way to interviewing participants who have submitted ideas.
The content would be a familiar format and have a high standard of quality. Think about a Kaizen Podcast, but for Catalyst proposals. A good mix of tutorial content for onboarding is also a primary scope.
Our format will consist of a series of videos that will highlight the following.
- 3 videos that teach how to participate in Catalyst
- how to register
- how to vote
- how to submit a proposal
- 7 videos that showcase ideas proposed by the community
(Collaborative format)
 
How De We Achieve The Plan
The scope of work outlined involves scheduling meetings with Catalyst participants, editing video and audio, drafting scripts, putting together visuals, and managing social media platforms. 
 
Timeframe
With a proposed plan of 10 different videos, the time capital required is equivalent to 8 hours per video.
Majority of the time required would be for editing and organizing content. At a rate of at least 1 video per week, the proposed plan can be executed reasonably within 2 months. This time horizon would begin at the time of funding, but planning for the content will begin with the submission of the proposal.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Main Deliverable:
A 60-day pilot program for a group of 15 Catalyst members, proposers, and community advisors, testing whether micro-incentives led to an increase in meaningful participation and higher quality of output. A report will then be distributed to the Catalyst community where we can review the findings and if successful, propose a larger trial.
--------IMPACT--------
How does this proposal fit into this challenge?
Recognising the value of new Catalyst members by providing micro-incentives for activities that contribute to the community.
How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?
By providing these incentives, members are encouraged to participate more frequently and in greater ways.
Outlook and future challenges?
A controlled pilot phase is a must for this type of proposal. A small group of 15, from a mix of members, community advisors and proposers will be selected.
The nominal incentives rate applied here will be more effective when applied to members of LCOL regions, hence, a micro-incentive averaging less than (0.x) ADA per valuable contribution is a good place to start. Values to be identified as part of the project implementation.
A key objective for this proposal will be measuring daily activity.
We will do this by tracking the following:

Comments
Daily Logins
Kudos
Upvotes
Proposals Submitted
CA specific metrics
Referrals

At any point it becomes apparent that there is an exploit in the rewards scheme, we will pause the program until it is identified and fixed.
After the pilot has concluded, a review will take place and a larger program may be proposed based on the results.
------FEASIBILITY-------
Reference (Past Successes):
WADA has access to a growing Catalyst member base, as well as developing their own membership platform. Through utilizing its own trusted network, reviewing applicants and using the membership platform to track activities, the pilot program has a high likelihood of successful implementation.
A control group will be created to track unincentivized activities. The group is not strictly a control group as they will know they are observed and may change their behavior, but this will at least provide a comparison.
Roadmap:
After funding is successfully secured:

First 30 days - Program is finalized and rates are set for each activity type
Applications are opened and participants are identified (15 days)
Expected public launch, Jan 15th
60-day duration - Rewards program begins, in conjunction with a new funding cycle, if possible.

Post-program:
(7-day duration) Data is collated, feedback is received from all participants and a report is created for the Catalyst community to review the results and decide whether or not to extend the program to a second, larger trial.
Core Team & Roles:
Josh F - Project Coordinator and Finance Lead @ Wada
Mercy - Community Moderator and Coordination Lead @ Wada
Sidney - Developer Liaison and Diaspora Lead @ Wada
+ WADA Team
Budget breakdown:
Incentives $5000
Admin fees $3000
Developer and platform fees $1000
Marketing $500
--------AUDITABILITY----------
What success looks like:
The right balance of micro-incentives and increased participation will mean that the program can be extended to a larger group.

3 months: Program finalized and launched, rates set, and platform developed 
6 months: Program completed, incentives distributed and feedback gathered
12 months: Second iteration of the program launched, with a larger user base and higher utilization of software tools for both tracking and disbursements

Key Metrics:

Average daily rewards gained (mean and mode)  

 

Average activity metrics (mean and mode) 

 

% difference in average activity metrics, test group vs control group (proxy for increased participation rate) 

 

% Daily contributors

 

Approval rating from participants  

 

No. Likely to participate again 

 

No. self-identified as ' fairly rewarded'

 
 
Risk Management:
Access to Activity Data: Accessing the ideascale API and understanding what data can be utilized will be needed to avoid self-reporting. In the case of missing data points, we have budgeted our developers to build a solution for activity tracking.
Rewards Exploits: We are constantly on the lookout for exploits and will have a moderator overseeing the program.
Scalability: How this program would scale for hundreds and then thousands of members would depend on a series of trials, growing incrementally as our process is improved and the technology becomes available to manage such a program. In the future, we may be able to employ AI to handle much of the moderation and auditing work.
Automation: Getting a smart contract to make daily rewards disbursements would be ideal, but it depends on both scalability and security concerns.
ROI: Measuring the value of contributions remains unquantifiable, however, measuring increased participation rates should account for some of this value.

OUR MISSION
""The SWARM is a community-driven ""grass roots"" initiative, supporting Cardano in its mission to build a universal decentralized system that provides access to a global society and economy.""
CONNECT: We bring the community together to unleash its full potential.
INCLUDE: We build bridges to ensure the diversity of the Cardano community.
EMPOWER: We encourage everyone to act and lead by creating space to do so.
 
WHO WE ARE
""The SWARM is a dynamic organism. It is the result of its individuals and groups. Each new individual brings a new quality to the swarm. A healthy swarm is constantly evolving.""
The active parts in SWARM are categorized in three groups that are related to engagement, trust and endurance. The Swarm doesn't give roles, roles are rather establishing themself over time in proved participation. For example: How do you become a birdwatcher? Well… by watching birds ;)

Hive: The core team that is taking the highest personal initiative and responsibility in the total Swarm actions.
Swarm Veterans: Highly dedicated supporters that have been constantly following the events over a period of time, taking action by hosting rooms and moderating sessions and discussions.
Swarm Supporters: Engaged supporters who are repeatedly active in meetings and discussions.

 
WHAT WE DO
Swarm operates and interacts in and around the wider Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals, projects and communities to Project Catalyst. Our activities are characterized by the following qualities:

Listen to the community and gather data and opinions from an unbiased perspective.
Host different events and meetups where the community members come together, share their ideas, connect, listen and get inspired from each other.
Reach out to underrepresented groups in the community, exploring ways to lower entry barriers and offer continuous support and advice.
Integrate local communities to enrich a diverse, multi-cultural Catalyst Community.
Moderate the community discussions in our events and Discord server in a way that empowers individuals to further engage.
Explore novel ways for decentralized governance within our community, based upon research and practice oriented methods.
Document and track our activity to build trust and transparency.
Reproduce ourselves by creating new swarm groups to have a diverse co-existence and collaboration of several swarms.

 
I M P A C T
 
Detailed Problem Description:
A community-driven project like the Catalyst Fund needs organized events to connect ideas and initiatives, discuss and solve problems together, and initiate collaboration. Without moderation and facilitation, these efforts often come to nothing or the discussions go in circles without reaching a conclusion or being implemented.
Proposed Solution:
To address these issues, weekly swarm sessions evolved out of the community in April. Since then, we have held Swarm sessions every week on Zoom - with different breakout rooms at each event. The weekly topics are related to current issues and events in the community. For example, when it is time for the Community Advisor (CA) to assess proposals, the Swarm Sessions provide workshops for CAs, etc.
Impact on the Challenge and Cardano:
The 'Catalyst Value Onboarding' challenge is seeking ideas to increase meaningful participation in Project Catalyst. By providing and organizing different stages and furthermore moderating various discussions on our Discord server, the Catalyst Swarm directly addresses this challenge already for several months.
 
 
F E A S I B I L I T Y

Provide physical hardware with a cryptographic identity and ""smart"" functionality by creating a digital twin utilizing metadata and NFTs.",4,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:45",NFT Nixie,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/NFT-Nixie/3055748-48088,,,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Summary
The NFT (""Nifty"") Nixie is a custom designed Nixie tube clock.  This is a real hardware product which acts as a proof-of-concept for demonstrating a method of tokenizing a physical asset using metadata, public key cryptography, NFTs, and blockchain.
Technical Overview
Through the magic of elliptical curve cryptography, the NFT (""Nifty"") Nixie hardware can be validated as authentic by providing a unique random signature to an authentication query.  The signature can be verified as authentic by referencing the public key located in the corresponding NFT's metadata. The private key is encrypted and locked inside the hardware forever, but the device can still use the key to generate its own signatures.
Along with the private key, a certificate chain of trust is used to prove that each key is authentic and signed by the same trusted root certificate.  The device and signer certificates are locked inside the device and the root certificate will be permanently added to the Cardano blockchain via transaction metadata. 
The hardware architecture is also designed to allow for secure control over the device which means it is feasible for the system to check if someone owns an NFT before allowing certain functionality.
Cardano is a good fit for this concept because of the low cost requirement for adding metadata to the blockchain.  The security is also very high in that the risk the information needed to prove authenticity disappears is only as big as the risk of the Cardano blockchain shutting down.
For a complete technical deep dive, please review this post on Substack: https://nftnixie.substack.com/p/nft-nixie-technical-deep-dive-part
Real World Parallels
A simple parallel to the ""old world"" would be a car title and the associated physical car. The car title establishes legal ownership of the car. Within the title, there is a VIN number, which links the paper certificate to the physical item because the same VIN number is also embedded into the vehicle. The state holds a centralized database of registered cars and their VIN numbers along with the details of the legal owner. If your personal information is listed on the car title, you can match the VIN number on the paper to the VIN number on the car to prove its yours.
In this project, the NFT would act as the car title. However, the NFT is also capable of acting as a car key. There can also be multiple car keys, each giving the driver a different max allowable speed to drive (for example). The state's centralized database is replaced with the metadata permanently written to the Cardano blockchain.  And finally, having access to the wallet holding the NFT replaces all of the personal information of the owner listed on the title.
Inspiration

Beeple sold an NFT representing one of his digital artworks.  He also mailed a copy of the physical artwork along with a paper certificate and hair sample to the buyer.  He claims the hair sample was from a Beeple stuffed animal, but there are rumors that he used his own hair...  There must be a better way to prove authenticity!   

 

Uniswap's Unisocks project produced 500 pairs of physical socks brandished with pink unicorns and the Uniswap logo. 1 fungible SOCKS token could be redeemed for a SOCKS NFT and an associated pair of physical socks.  To my knowledge, there is no way to prove the physical socks are not counterfeit.

 

The New Balance and IOHK Realchain & OMN1S concept allowed anyone to physically scan a NFC tag embedded in a pair of shoes to prove authenticity.  To my knowledge, the shoes had no digital representation, the tags were only used as a method for tracking ownership and proving authenticity.

 
 Philosophy Questions

Which asset holds value?  The NFT or the physical? 
If an asset has both a physical and digital representation, does that give it more value? 
If the physical asset is destroyed or damaged how does that affect the value of the NFT? 
If I lose access to the NFT, I might no longer be able to use the physical asset (depending on implementation). How does that affect the value of the physical asset?

Status
After 2 hardware builds and 4-5 months of hardware and software development, 20 fully functional proof-of-concept prototypes are already built and in hand. Firmware with core functionality has been written and a simple front end webpage has been designed. The webpage has a working authentication mechanism which has been verified to work with the hardware.
Essentially the core physical product is ready to go.
Roadmap
- 1-3 months (or less): Project and product release - hardware ready ship with simple clock functionality and authentication capability.  Hire a front-end dev or Plutus pioneer to help finish the ""exchange-for physical+NFT"" portion of the project.
- 3-6months: Advanced firmware completed and shipped with access control capability, cryptocurrency price ticker, and Cardano epoch slot clock functionality.  Ship instructions for connecting and using a Raspberry PI (instead of the onboard microcontroller) with the NFT Nixie as a Raspberry Pi header.
- 6-12 months: Ideate, design, and release another cool concept with similar proof of authenticity and potentially new features.  Due to the current worldwide chip shortage, these dates might slip further depending on the lead time for required components.
- 12-36 months: : Ideate, design, and release a higher quantity, less niche, product
The funds requested here will be used to support further development and future new project deliveries for the Cardano ecosystem.  In the short term, I will most likely need to hire some kind of front-end dev or Plutus Pioneer to finish the ""exchange for physical+NFT"" portion of the project. 
Approx. cost for completed proof-of-concept hardware builds (20 units): $12,000.  Cost varies greatly depending on quantity and complexity of hardware, but am happy to be completely transparent on every individual cost item required for future project builds.  Hardware builds can be expensive. If there is a mistake in the design, it costs a lot of money to run another build...unlike software engineering where a code recompile is usually free.
 
My time: My time is not typically free, but so far this project has been a labor of love for months.  I currently have a full time job at a top Silicon Valley company which can be very demanding of my time - this hobby project must always come second to that since it is what supports me financially.
Connect w/ me
I would like to try to connect with anyone who is interested in bringing this concept to life as well as help further refine this idea into even more products in the future. This could include DEXes, NFT marketplaces, smart contract developers, firmware developers, hardware developers, cryptography experts, or business/marketing folks. 
I am happy to gift one NFT Nixie and associated NFT to a partner which needs the hardware to help with firmware or front-end development.
I would also like to think about releasing the product of this proof-of-concept in a style similar to the UNISOCKS project, which might make it a great showpiece for a new Cardano DEX.  Fungible NIXIE tokens will be burnt in return for the NFT and physical NFT Nixie.
The NFT Nixie will be released no matter what happens with Catalyst.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Before going into our detailed proposal, we included a short summary on the (i) team, (ii) the cardano adoption in the next 3/6 months; (iii) a summary of our existing product in which we will insert the POC under this fund, (iv) a short explanation of this proposal, and (v) what 3-6-12 months success looks like.
Team – We have a versatile team with experience in blockchain projects that is able and committed to tackle this challenge within the budget proposed.

Cardano adoption and impact in the next 6 months - We already have a finished mobile application (2 years in development) to integrate this Fund 6 proof of concept in and are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected by Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6).
Short summary of the Profila app (as testing ground for this fund 6 POCs) - Profila is a platform (mobile IOS/Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call ""Brands"") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance.
People can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do (today only in fiat). (see ""Illustration 1).
Big picture explanation of the current proposal . We are developing an umbrella concept with the code name ""Metronome"" which is based on the idea of empowering individuals with granular control within different data scenarios and relationship archetypes. These features will involve providing clear consent about the channel preference, cadence, and type of communication allowed between organizations (whether being brands, companies, or other kinds of organizations), In short, it enables individuals to have full control over the flow through the ""pipes"". These explicit preferences will be controlled by individuals across all of their scenarios and relationships or more granular per brand or industry. These preferences will be captured by utilizing translation metadata to ensure that the scope and details of these preferences are captured and enforced.
Success after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be the developed POC for this smart contract. Success after 6 months would be the integration of this smart contract POC into our existing app and first test with our existing customer. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of the POC, used for each data subscription.
 
Now let's move on to our actual detailed proposal (!):
 
1.   Transactional Scenarios
There are many instances where individuals want to convey a signal to the market for their interest in specific products and/or services and want to do so in a zero-knowledge or minimal-knowledge environment. And the individual may also want to specific through what channels they wish to receive information/offers and how many offers they wish to receive within a specific time frame. Lastly, they can decide to do so in a true zero-knowledge environment or one where some a minimal amount of information is provided in order to help companies provide more targeted and relevant offers.
Let's take two examples (one for each).
An individual decides to take up a new hobby (let's say, archery). That new hobby will involve procuring the proper equipment and clothing, training and instructions, and general resources to help the individual begin their journey to integrating this new hobby into their lives. They may wish to discover companies that cater to that hobby but do not want to be overwhelmed with offers or ads based on their observed behavior on search engines and social media. Instead, they would convey an Interest Signal which would include the required metadata that conveys
- what channel they want to receive information in
- What kinds of content/services they wish to receive (products and/or service)
- How many offers/ads they wish to receive per type within a defined period (per week, per month).
In this scenario, it may be irrelevant the gender or geographic location of the individual, so this scenario could run as a Zero-Knowledge one, with no personally identifiable information passing through, only the Interest Signal and the stated preferences.
A second scenario would fall under the Minimal Knowledge area where the recipient has information that is pertinent to responding but nothing that is directly identifiable to an individual. An individual decides they want to purchase a new automobile. Beyond that Buying Signal, it would be useful for companies to know more about the person in order to make the best offer. These might include general location (for instance, Canada), and some lifestyle details which will need to be accommodated by any purchase (for instance, 2 kids, 3 large dogs, hobbies including skiing/snowboarding). The individual can then dictate the preferences for offers that would be captured with defined metadata
- what channel they want to receive offers in
- When they want the offers and when do they expect to make the purchase.
- How many offers/ads they wish to receive and for how long of a time period.
These would be considered qualified leads by automobile companies since there is clear interest and intent, while also allowing the individuals to product scarcity (in defining the number of offers) and controlling the cadence of offers before they make a decision.
In general, these use cases are defined as Transactional; short term needs with defined timelines and outcomes. Let's turn our attention to more longer-term, relationship-centric scenarios
2.   Relationship Archetypes
In the Profila mode relationships are either defined as one-way or bi-directional. One way relationships (where an individual expresses interest in a brand's product or services but there is no data subscription offered or accepted) are called Connections.
Connections
An individual can connect with a brand that they know they like or occasional make purchases from. It's not vital that the brand have a defined known data relationship with the individual (so no names or other intimate details required). In this kind of relationship, the individual may just want to know the new products offered by the company once or twice a year, or want to receive offers or discounts for their next purchase. It is a casual relationship but one that is still profitable to the company since it produces revenue with minimal marketing effort.
In this scenario, an individual can connect with a brand and then define the terms of the interaction.
- what channels they want to receive offers/content
- The types of content they wish to receive (product updates, company social campaigns, offers and discounts)
- How often they will allow these contacts (once or twice a year, for example).
These preferences will be stored with metadata contracts along with the defined preferences about which personal data is provided (perhaps the person's gender, age, and city/country). Combined, the individual as asserted control over what the company knows about them as individuals and how often they should expect to be contacted and through which channel. And for the brand, they now have an existing customer who can be marketed too with less effort, higher engagement (since it's according to their preferences) and better conversation and return on their minimal marketing investment.
Subscribers
The other relationship scenario present in the Profila model is one of Subscription. In this scenario, a brand sends a subscription offer to an individual with the request for specific types of personal information; demographic and psychographic based on self-discovery quizzes organized into categories). This offer is for defined renumeration and for a defined duration of time. The individual can accept or reject the offer after reviewing the conditions and requests. This agreement will be captured in a transaction metadata contract as per the previous Profila proposal for Catalyst.
The second aspect of this relationship is a separate contract capturing the metadata as defined by the individual for the expected behavior within the relationship. These stated preferences would take a similar form as what we've seen in earlier scenarios above
- what channel would they like their communication in
- What kind of communication types are allowed
- How often they will allow communication per type
- Any special timely preferences, such as wanting to restrict content for a certain amount of time (for holiday or because a product line is not relevant to the individual for the coming time period).
As an example, imagine an individual has accepted a subscription offer from a shoe company that specializes in outdoor footwear. The individual is a brand loyalist and has a range of this brand's offerings (from sandals to shoes to hiking boots). The individual expects to be a long term customer of this brand but right now their current collection of shoes are relatively new and they are not in the market for a purchase for the coming 9-12 months. While this individual currently has their preferences stated as accepting monthly offers and updates through their preferred channel, they want to change these preferences so that they receive no offers for the next 12 months but would appreciate any updates on socially conscious projects the company is involved with. These new preferences would be captured, overwriting the previous preferences, and the brand would know that, to keep this customer happy, they can scale back their marketing efforts until this brand loyalist is ready to purchase a new product in a year's time.
3.   Governance / Enforcement
All of these examples open up a new range of empowerment for individuals to create and manage their communication preferences to a degree not possible with any current solution or platform. But without a defined governance and enforcement this power would be moot. Thankfully, we have very simple but powerful ways to completely enforce the preferences stored as metadata in contracts.
If the chosen channel for communications is the Profila platform (where individuals would receive communication in the form of posts or messages) we will be able to use the preference metadata to enforce those preferences. For instance, if I have informed a brand that I wish to only receive one offer a month, the amount of communication possibilities available to a brand will be ""0""they sent me something last week. It will only become ""1"" again in three weeks time. Since communication through the platform is based on available engagements, that brand will have no mechanism to send additional communications beyond my stated preference. Within our platform these preferences are completely enforceable.
If the chosen channel for communication is email, we also have a solution, similar to one's employed by Apple and others. Each Profila user will have an @profila.com address which can be registered by the user as their default email (what is exposed to brands) but has a corresponding personal address (such as an @gmail.com or @outlook.com address) that communication is routed through. Because Profila can play the role of protector and middle-man, we can again enforce the preferences stated by the user. Profila can play the gatekeeper role that each individual decides they want us to play. Or not. It is always up to each individual.
4.   Practical aspects – ""show us the money"" – costs
Via this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our metronome POC, which will require at least a budget of 36.650 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:
- 15 days of senior blockchain developer @ 900 USD per day – totaling 13.500 USD
- 20 days of web/backend developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.000 USD
- 20 days of app developer @ 300 USD per hour – totaling +/- 6.000 USD
- 7 days of legal and operational work, including reporting @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.650 USD
 5.   Practical aspects – ""getting on the road"" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer
At the time of the submission of our application, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.
(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila. These campaigns will show the benefits of Profila (=individual in control; individual compensated) and will attract the first customers to join this kind of new loyalty program. It is therefore not necessary that all the brands' customers join, but mostly the loyal customers that want to be engaged. We project that for SME companies, around 5% of their existing customer base will join this ""new relationship"" in the first year/after the promotional campaign. This would be seen as a success.
We have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021. According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 in 2022 (by adding more brands).
(2) Geographical focus market? We are currently launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q1 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).
(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy ""Millennials"" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old), and ""brand-loyalists"" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).
Following a research collaboration we conducted with the University of St. Gallen University of Zurich (Switzerland) to define our go-to-market strategy, we concluded that Millennials are the target consumer audience. Millennials carry out most of their transactions online and are aware of their digital footprint. They are also aware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it. 
(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers.
(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end-of-April 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above). 
Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)
As an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:
First, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.
Second, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.
In addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.
Finally, we are looking into open-sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.
What does success look like?
Imagine an individual who has a wealth of brand relationships; from those where they are a loyalist and those brands they interact/purchase from on occasion. In addition, they enjoy discovering new brands and products. In all of these cases, this individual has created a simple structure where they control how often and even when during the week the ads, content, and offers come to them. The rest of the week they can enjoy life without the constant bombardment of email newsletters & unwanted and irrelevant ads in their chosen channel. And when they decide to go on holiday that can put a temporary stop on the entire flow. In short, they are in control, with their privacy and data protected. And brands can now spend their time on quality instead of quantity.
We will shortly add additional information on the 3 - 6 and 12 month milestones to measures succes of the project's development and implementation.

AtalaGotchi is an onchain game for the Cardano blockchain.
AtalaGotchi's will be ""living"" creatures on the blockchain. They will respond to time, feed and other wallet characteristics.
They will grow as they are fed and change in appearance as they grow. They will also take on characteristics from other NFT's held in your wallet, as well as the stakepool you are delegating to. AtalaGotchi's can die if they are not fed.
This game will demonstrate the possible interactions between NFTs and Smart Contracts in an open framework allowing for other creators to participate
Background
The Cardano Blockchain is operated by stakepools. Currently there is a desire to increase the level of decentralisation by encouraging delegators to stake their ADA with single stakepools (those that have not split their pledge).
The protocol has incentives to encourage decentralisation. This will be further encouraged by the use of Not AdaGotchi's game play.
The Not AdaGotchi's team is using this concept to demonstrate solutions that will be used in other decentralised systems, such as decentralised insurance that requires similar interactions between NFTs and Smart Contracts.
Tokenomics
AtalaGotchi's aim is to be an open and organic ecosystem, there are no hard coded limits. Creatures are spawned by Stakepools, they can be bred when they reach maturity and they die if they are not fed or can't breed if they become too old.
Creatures and Feed are airdropped to participating delegators. Each Epoch, they will be issued with new Feed tokens.
We expect there to be an initial oversupply of feed, but as breeding starts, we expect feed to be scarce, creating a market for feed. Those that are delegating to participating stakepools but are not playing, could sell the feed to others.

WHO WE ARE
Ferdon is the creator of the no-code platform QModeler for blockchain that abstracts the complexity of blockchain.
We pioneered the concept of No-Code Hackathons - events where citizen developers come together to crowed-source solutions to the pressing problems using no-code platforms.
Received funding in F5 to increase the use of No-Code in Africa (co-proposed with WADA)
 
WHAT WE ARE DOING IN FOOD SAFETY

Running No-Code Hackathon in Africa in conjunction with WADA to build a food traceability application on Cardano
Running No-Code Hackathon in Vietnam to build a food traceability application on Cardano

C I T I Z E N D E V E L O P M E N T
Citizen Developers are are people with little to no knowledge of programming who build software using No-Code platforms like QModeler. The advent of No-Code has created a sea change in the way software is developed by allowing Citizen Developers to build software and communities to work collaboratively to create software solutions to problems. Citizen Developer is a new term to describe someone who is participating in building software products despite having little or no technical knowledge.The growth of Citizen development is estimated to be 30% per year will overtake programming development in the next 3 years.
N O -C O D E   H AC K A T H O N S
No-Code hackathons are long running events, 3-6 month or even longer, that brings people of all backgrounds together together around the task of creating software to solve a problem. We hope to soon use No-Code hackathons to include Plutus smart contracts using QModeler. Follow the progress of no-code hackathons at https://www.cardanonocode.com/
W H O  W E  A R E
We believe technology should unite and not divide us. We strive to democratize technology by simplifying it so that innovation happens across all strata of society. Our vision will be realized when any sized company, from enterprise to a small business owner, or even a single person with a yen to create, can innovate solutions to their problems. Ferdon - the maker of Qmodeler is it  located in Vietnam. QModeler is a supporter of the Vietnam National Computer Olympic Team where many of our team members competed.
Ferdon is a company of currently 20 people passionate about democratizing technology. Ferdon has been working 3 and a half years to build our flagship product, QModeler, one of the first no-code platforms and the first no-code platform for blockchain. QModeler is capable of synthesizing models into smart contracts.
Ferdon is launching the first of its kind, no-code hackathons, long running events that bring together communities to solve pressing issues using No-Code tools.
Ferdon's active projects include

In collaboration with WADA we have launched a first of its kind no-code hackathon to develop a solution for food safety traceability in Africa.

Plutus Smart Contracts are all the rage. They promise financial solutions for Social and Environmental impact (SoFi), real-world uses (RealFi) and new means of organising globally (DAOs); Solutions that bring economic identity to billions.
Very few people, however, will fully understand what a Smart Contract does. They are complicated because they combine three professions: Computer Science, Finance, and Law. Programming languages codify financial mechanisms, but they cannot be read or audited by humans who are not programmers. That includes courts and arbitrators of disputes. This opaqueness and indirect relationship to intent is an opportunity for phishing attacks, bait and switch scams, and outright fraud.

Metadata Specification for Ricardian Contracts and Contract Terms
A critical component of contract law and user security is preventing people from agreeing to something that will not happen. Therefore, verifiable human-readable contracts are essential to bridging the real world with DeFi, Digital Identity (DID), and NFT solutions.
Ian Grigg coined the term Ricardian Contract[1] in 1996 while working on one of the first cryptocurrency payment systems. A Ricardian Contract in plain language is a document for a commercial purpose readable by both humans and machines. Readable by humans for mutual understanding. Readable by machines for parameters and execution. The combined bundle is cryptographically verifiable.
By conforming to a common specification, human-readable contracts can be validated and presented in a consistent and verifiable way. By linking contract terms to specific steps in Smart Contract executions, we can monitor and audit them. This enables using meta-data to record the execution of supply-chain contracts that incorporate warehouse receipts, linking regulatory reporting to steps in compliance, or establishing a Joint-Venture DAO [3].
Our Solution
A standards-based Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) Metadata specification and reference implementation for Ricardian Contracts and Contract Terms.
This proposal is for working on the initial analysis and design of the specification to incorporate some prototyping toward a reference implementation. We will also work with other proposers of related metadata specifications to ensure the work aligns and is not duplicating efforts.
Using transaction metadata to instrument smart contract execution is an important consideration. Performance labelling links to the smart contract to human-readable contract terms. Compliance, governance processes, and performance-based financing all require this type of linkage.
All project documentation, specification, and reference implementations will be
published to our Github repository using open-source and open-culture licenses. The draft specification will be entered into and shepherded through the Cardano Improvement proposal process.
The draft specification will draw upon and work with other CIP, and many industry standards and tools; Formalised or defacto standards. That include:

Cardano Message Signing Standard CIP-0008[2]: Using Cardano address private keys to sign arbitrary data.
W3C Verifiable Claims[4]: Data model for expressing cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable credentials. Including W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification.
W3C Linked Data[5]: A set of standards that formalises how to describe and integrate pieces of data across the Web. Of particular interest are JSON-LD and Schema.org.
Project Accord[6] and Catala[7]: An open ecosystem of structured agreements (Cicero) and Executable logic (Ergo) for building smart agreements and regulation (Catala).
Kantara Consent Receipt Specification[12]: A human-readable record of consent and receipt. Includes requirements for linking to privacy notices and descriptions of what information has been or will be collected.
EOSIO.CDT Ricardian Contract Specification[8]: A specification for Ricardian contracts on EOS blockchains.
Identity Foundation Sidetree[9]: A Protocol for anchoring decentralised identifiers in Blockchains.
Content Addressable Storage (CAS): Git, IPFS, Dat are tools for storing and replicating blocks of data identified with their content hash.

That is not an exhaustive list of the prior art. Our specific intent is to map the prior work into the Cardano Ecosystem; To take advantage of Cardano's EUTXO model, native asset and transaction metadata support, and leverage Atala Prism if possible.
The Cardano Message Signing Standard (CIP-0008), for example, uses address private keys to sign arbitrary data. With the CIP standard, you can verify and check documents, images, user consent receipts, contract terms, and user agents as part of a contract. Since these contract resources may represent a person, company, or DAO, it is essential to know they are signed by the entity and have not been altered.
To refine and improve the specification for draft publication future funding will be needed. A reference implementation needs development to ensure the specification is practical. Software Development Kits (libraries and tools) will be needed to help developers use the standard.
What Success Looks Like
Our proposal will perform analysis of prior work, assess the choices for design, estimate future specification effort, and develop a plan to proceed with complete specification work. Draft specification writing, UI mockups, and code prototyping will be completed to help the effort.
After one month:

A review of specifications, literature, and existing tools/SDKs related to Ricardian Contracts.
Engagement with the Cardano community to provide input and feedback has begun.
Consultation with smart contract developers to help identify needs and points of integration has begun.

After three months:

User journey and UI wireframe mockups are developed to illustrate user scenarios.
Prototype reference implementation has been deployed on testnet to demonstrate very basic utility.
The initial draft of the specification is made available for community review and feedback.

After six months:

Refinement of the initial draft specification is completed and submitted into the Cardano Improvement process.
A development plan for taking the specification through the Cardano Improvement process has been actioned.
A detailed plan for fully developing a reference implementation and Software Development Kits is submitted to Catalyst.
A model for the sustainability of the project is actioned. Covering additional funding and ongoing support will be circulated for community feedback and adoption.

After twelve months:

The Specification is a CIP.
An SDK for the specification has been developed.
At least one Smart-Wallet has integrated the specification.
At least one DApp/Financial Solution is using the standard as an integral part of the products feature set.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.
Our business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.
This approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services

COST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.
MATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.
TRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?

We solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. 
We solve the MATCH and TRUST problems with the decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.
Another great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.
The key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.
Technical approach
The web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.

(We are cousins.)
Timeline
Development of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.
The definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.
The definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.
The definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!
Campaign suitability
Since our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal supports a key ""value added"" of our service: decentralized storage of customer reviews via on-chain metadata. There are many tradeoffs to be explored, such as full on-chain storage, hashed on-chain storage, or IPFS/filecoin-like solutions. We are requesting $10k in funds to support prototyping and testing to help determine the optimal implementation of this key component of our business.
Why should Catalyst voters support this project?
While the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good ""geek out"" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.
We think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common ""lack of developer buy-in"" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.

Whether one is building a bridge between Cardano and Ethereum or Cardano and a sidechain (like we at dcSpark are doing with the Milkomeda sidechain bridge), building an interface for bridge transfer requests is required. Currently no such standard exists, and every individual bridge project must create their own from scratch.
dcSpark will work towards making a generalized standard that allows developers to add in extra information about the specific chain that the assets are intended to be sent to. Furthermore it will provide other quality-of-life improvements such as a refund address and potentially other fields which standardizes the refund process in case bridges run into problems.
This standard will be used in the Milkomeda protocol and will be open for other bridges to use for their own bridge implementations to get off the ground more quickly.

Colombia is perceived as a corrupt country by different rankings that, on different spectrums, place Colombia between the most corrupt countries in the world and- to the very least- one with a serious problem of corruption. Public Management in Colombia, therefore, turns into one area of key importance to solve this issue. 
One of the key challenges to solving this issue is the integrity of data and use thereof to bring about insights on govt indicators. The government is not conclusive with its data, it usually is tampered with to provide good figures to the public opinion, it also comes with a lack of treatment since the data collected lacks value to both public servants and citizens. True insights on data are needed through data scientist approach, however, this could not be efficiently executed unless the data to be analysed is reliable.
The project consists of two moments:
Pilot project on health record through metadata: the undertaking will provide a first glance at the use of blockchain for record-keeping, the health metadata, initially a few sets of information on covid deaths and number of people without health insurance (subject to change since it will be the secretary of health which will determine at the time of execution what data is more suitable for trial). Once the transaction metadata is proved to be effective to store information in a decentralised manner, the secretary of health will open up to more data sets on other variables usually stored on centralised databases.
Open metrics with value in smart contracts: the team will provide a solution to the problem of data without value (insights). Reports from CEPAL and OECD have stressed the need for developing countries to develop better data management; one of these problems is data without value: governments are storing tumultuous amounts of data without creating any value to either the population or policy makers. Alongside with the problem of tampered data, this makes the problem of subjective policy making where policy-makers cannot truly understand the population they are impact, as well as the problem of the population engaging into the process becoming active authors of their own policies.
As the pilot project turns successful (within six moths having started the project), the amount of data will be significant enought to start criss-crossing data sets (stored through metadata) with other government databases (not necessarily stored on the blockchain since they would belong to other departments in the government) through a smart contract designed to pull out those insights unexistent up to this date.
Solving real world problems: as transaction metada is the first step to ensure traceability of data, as well the integrity thereof, the project will give the cardano blockchain enough exposure to both the government and citizens as it would be the first attempt to bring about this technology into action in Colombia. As the information will be public, citizens will be able to use it to create databases of their own, as well as Dapps and DAOs; public servants will be able to further develop governments applications making use of smart contracts and other services regarding digital identity (PRISM) and land registries as the blockchain becomes known. This project intends to be a pioneer for the country, showing the potential to solve developing countries' problems, as it is already doing in Africa and paving the ground for future partnerships with the colombian government.
Definition of success: the success is determined upon a 12-month timeframe. 1) the first six months are going to be solely dedicated to selecting alongside the Secretary of Health the datasets that are goint to be used for the pilot project, upbringing such data onto the blockchain through transaction metadata, and adding further data sets once the ones selected for the project pilot are fully integrated into the blockchain. It will be considered not successful if the data sets posed at the beginning of the project are unable to be ready by the end of the first six months; 2) the next six months are going to be dedicated to the multidisciplinary effort of policy-makers, data analysts and community to understand those insights or relationships that can be drawn out of the metadata, e.g., correlation between number of people without health insurance and unemployment figures, etc. For this, the six-month lapse shall be considered a success if we have effectively integrated other government databases (or datasets not necessarily stored on the blockchain) with the metadata collected on health records (on the blockchain) to draw new indicators and insights to the public and public policies.
Budget requirements: the project will count with the support of Universidad Santo Tomás (to which two of the project leads are associates, one as a professor and the other as an active member of the observatory in territorial public policies), allowing us to reduce costs in terms of research of the communities impacted, social dynamics, and data analysis since human resource is going to be provided to a certain extent by enthusiasts on the blockchain. 
The costs are also going to be reduced as the project starts running, the expansion to other areas of the public administration, as well as the extent to which data is going to be used are going to be supported by the public sector.
Most costs are going to be for the engineer lead and team of developers. As the Colombian Peso is heavily devalued, 1,000 dollars account for over 5 minimum wages. The project would require 12,000 dollars to cover the cost of the computer scientists involved in the process- one of whom is the third project lead.

Problem Statement (continued):
Many dApps (Decentralised Applications) will require access to the documents signed by the parties in order to proceed further with business process workflows. One of the viable solutions could be to encrypt the entire document with OpenPGP, store it in IPFS in encrypted format, and allow authorized parties to decrypt it. This solution is far from perfect.
What if you want to hide certain information in the document due to privacy concerns, but the rest of the information should be available? Or if you want multiple parties to have different levels of access to various fields depending on their roles in your business process, how would you do that?
In database terms, this type of granular access is called cell-level security, and some high-end business intelligence solutions, such as Microsoft Analysis Services implement it out of the box; however, these products are expensive and centralized. How would you implement cell-level security in a decentralized network of nodes, such as a blockchain?
Most likely you will move out this document verification process to an off-chain API, compromising the immutability and integrity that blockchain offers while also diminishing the level of trust in your DApp.
Describe your solution to the problem (continued):
Logosphere (https://logosphere.io) - a Layer 2 metadata side-chain backed by Fluree - an open source decentralized semantic graph database (funded in Fund 5) will solve that problem once fully integrated.
Fluree implements data centric security at its core through a feature called Smart Functions which conditionally defines who can access or modify data at the cell level. This way, the access rules are baked inside the data itself residing on an immutable ledger.
Smart Functions can reliably evaluate user identity and user data, because of Fluree's fundamental implementation of cryptographic signatures for all queries and transactions.
In Fluree, an identity is defined by an auth record, which is the central component of data-centric security. Every query and transaction is attributed to a particular auth record which is derived from a user's private/public key.
Since every query to Fluree is cryptographically signed, therefore all the fields that don't have permissions to be visible by a particular identity are ignored and are not included in the query results. This is a simple and intuitive way of making sure that some data at the most granular level stays hidden from unauthorized parties, while being visible to the authorized ones without changing anything in the data itself., which is the central component of data-centric security. Every query and transaction is attributed to a particular auth record which is derived from a user's private/public key.

Fun Fact: Ancient libraries chained their books to the shelves to retain ownership. Today's blockchain replaces the iron chains of the middle ages to retain legacy book information with an NFT. 
Love books? Nothing in the market exists to capture the metadata for books not held or categorized by libraries. Custom made books or rare books held by collectors outside the library system have no means of discovery. Accidental discovery is not a good strategy. The book you write or create is YOUR legacy. An NFT can enable future generations to know that your book exists and provide the breadcrumbs to find it. 
This project will enable a permissionless metadata archive for authors, bookbinders and private book collectors without centralized gatekeepers (such as libraries).
1. Design and implement a web portal for independent use by authors, bookbinders and book collectors to create NFTs with a pre-configured set of metadata specific to books. *Imagine OpenSea for books only*. Existing NFT creation sites do not provide sufficient metadata for future book discovery.
Catalyst funding is needed for developer time (75%). The remaining (25%) addresses annual fees associated with the project, such as hosting and IPFS implementation. As an entrepreneur rather than developer, this is where I need the Cardano community support. I can establish a web presence and write user documentation.

Scripts to define a set of book-specific NFT metadata

The criteria for book metadata is well documented, eliminating the need for in-depth research. For example, common book metadata includes:

Title, author, publisher, release date, print run, price, distribution (digital, print), bookbinder, designer, paper (handmade, watermarked, brand), print method (digital, letterpress, hand-written), cover material (leather, parchment, cloth, paper, bark, fabric, etc.), gilder (if not the binder). This list is an elementary sampling. 

Additionally:

Auto-create a user wallet option for NFT storage.
Align a method to support NFT payment via ADA or fiat. A pool of ADA would be on reserve to serve those more comfortable with fiat.
Interplanetary File Storage (IPFS) to house the metadata collected with the NFT creation. This is a critical component to the future facing goals of this project.

2. Explore Blockfrost.io for an API to create an easy to use app for researchers and collectors to discover a book's metadata.
3. Future iteration may include creating a vault to facilitate storage for the end users uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the requirement to store their NFT in a wallet.
4. Future potential to buy shares in a particular rare book's NFT or to embed smart contract criteria for lending.
Why are books so successful as fine art? 

You can collect loads of them and they don't take up much space
Books increase in value with time
Collectors have deep pockets

Roadmap follows Lean methodology for a minimally viable product:

Q4 2021: Secure a developer for the project
Late Q4 2021: Confirm scripts required, processes documented
Q1 2022: write scripts, APIs and IPFS connections, create functional wallet demo, create fiat and ADA payment gateway  
Late Q1 2022: test all scripts, connections and payment gateways
Q2 2022: May 15, projected go-live

Key Success Criteria: post go-live

3 months: educate and evangelize among global book community networks results in increasing site traffic and requests for information; subject matter expertise 
6 months: progressive daily/weekly growth in NFT creation
12 months: sufficient demand to explore additional fund proposals for vault storage and/or smart contracts for book royalties

Key Challenge Metrics addressed by this project:

Traceability
Product Authentication

To support the private author or book collector, an NFT for each rare book supports risk management by documenting the book's provenance (its history) and proof of current ownership. The financial return, particularly for rare book collectors, could be very high given our increasingly disaster-prone climate changes. 
The Guild of Bookworkers has accepted my proposal to write an article for the world-wide membership about NFTs and their use cases for bookbinders (draft submission October 1, publication in December). I also have access to an internationally active book_arts listserv, and wide communication/collaboration with bookbinders throughout the world. The rare book world is a small, but financially impactful.
Bookbinders serve the rare book market in both book creation and book repair. As bookbinders share the value of creating an NFT for books, growth by the end of year 1 is likely to be significant. The true end-state benefit will be centuries from now, when the books not accepted by libraries are discoverable.
This project addresses the Cardano Foundation's mission by contributing to the positive advancement of blockchain as a world-changing technology.

What's The Innovatio Founder?
The Innovatio Founder is a P2P crowdfunding marketplace with multiple funding modalities, using the Cardano blockchain to deploy smart contracts and meta-data facilitating the funding of diverse start-ups and DApps in a secure, transparent and efficient ecosystem.
This crowdfunding marketplace is focused on innovative technology, video games, and design categories. The first crowdfunding model available will be the rewards category, where the investor receives the product or service in the future.
The Innovatio Founder would be a private company, which will comply with EU rules and regulations allowing it to offer this service throughout all the EU, enabling the mass adoption of blockchain technology in the European market.
 
What's Gamechanger?
GameChanger is a humanized and gamified wallet that aims to embark end users on a simple and intuitive experience by making it easy for them to develop and use around an ecosystem of DApps accessible from the wallet itself. It has also engaged with developers to facilitating simple, novel, and crucial development and integrations for upcoming projects in Cardano.
GameChanger is helping people realize the potential behind metadata on the Cardano blockchain, offering them features to build applications around the ecosystem. Innovatio's plans align with the use of metadata to anchor real-world data and identities in the blockchain metadata, this serves as a starting point for a collaboration with a lot of potential in the future.
 
What are we doing together?
Innovatio is developing its back-end architecture where it needs to implement many on-chain and off-chain functionalities to make the use of the platform as simple, secure, and transparent as possible.
GameChanger is currently developing very interesting functionalities that can provide solutions to Innovatio's needs.
Therefore, we have decided to work together to develop these functionalities more efficiently and productively, bringing a Win-To-Win to both projects.
 
We will work together in the development of features such as:

Implementation of external wallets.
Ease on non-custodial wallet creation through GameChanger Wallet for users.
Architecture and operation of an Integrated DEX/SWAP
Smart-contract support through GameChanger Wallet for DEX/SWAP operations and others
Re-funding system for invested funds.
Exchange of meta-data with legal and juridical information for the investor.
Representation and voting system with meta-data.
The representation of marketplace users in the blockchain and real identity with meta-data.
Client-side data anchoring on Cardano Blockchain

 
How we will achieve this proposal?
GameChanger will develop a simple mechanism so that any user without basic knowledge of blockchain can create a private wallet in simple steps, allowing them to link it to their profile and have self custody of their private key. This will be achieved by using simple URL redirections.
Creating a decentralized self-sovereign data anchoring on the blockchain to allow users to subscribe their data to the platform, aided by GameChanger Wallet URL dApp connector, in order to have objective information to represent legal contracts with commitments and responsibilities of individuals.
 
How does success look like?
1. Fiat users will be able to easily create an external wallet to have representation on the blockchain and perform corresponding transactions.
2. Database information can be easily represented and linked on the blockchain enabling functionalities to be used in the real world.
3. Visibility of the importance of metadata prioritizing it over Smart Contracts when it's possible.
 
KPIs
1) Game Changer wallets created by platform users.
2) Cardano developers who have started developing meta-data functionalities and implementations.
3) Number of transactions with meta-data anchoring.
 
Breakdown Budget
GameChanger Wallet Development: $10.000
Innovatio's Architecture Development: $10.000

Dear All,
 
Our vision is to create a global product that will solve the problems with transactional trust, protect all actors (consumers and document providers) and do it in a way that is easy. We want to unleash the transformational capabilities and power of Cardano blockchain in the consumer world. This can be done by:


creating a Cardano-metadata-powered system that will keep track of document hashes and relevant metadata;


adding a private database layer for optional document storage;


providing all relevant functionalities via a beautiful, and UX-optimised web portal;


abstracting away from the challenges of registering a crypto exchange account, undergoing KYC/AML, buying crypto, setting up a wallet and learning to transact on the blockchain. Users should be able to pay via traditional payment gateways (in addition / alternative to crypto payments of course). First they need to feel the utility. Once they do they will yearn to know more about the underlying technology which we will comprehensively discuss. This will drive adoption in a more efficient way.


 
Features
Our trusted solution based on Cardano metadata will enable to securely manage document 1) ingest, 2) storage and 3) verification process, initialised by consumers or business transaction parties. The portal will enable the following key features and functions:
* Full and secure control over any digital asset and its versioning without the possibility of unauthorised change or replacement;
* Blockchain-guaranteed document integrity;
* Full data history without possibility to change it over time;
* Registration on public Cardano blockchain platform;
* Transparency for all parties of digital assets exchange.
Features such as control over publication, storage, and sharing of immutable documents allows clients to ensure document authenticity and asset provenance, especially for documents which must be trusted for a long time-horizon.
 
Benefits
For companies: cost and time efficiency, increased trust with fast authentication and validation, increasing the credibility of services.
 
For consumers: Full privacy and security of high-value information, fraud protection against counterfeit and falsification of documents and fake messages.
 
Sample Scenarios
1. Protection against phishing attacks;
2. Compliance with EU's Durable Medium regulations;
3. Protection against dishonest business partners.
 
Consumers all around the world get their bills and contract documents from issuers (banks, telco operators, utility providers etc.) every day. Hackers and dishonest business partners forge documents (pdfs or hard copies) and place urgent calls for payments of penalties for non-existing services. Consumers can't perform quick checks if the document is true or false. The same situation is with SMS or various widely used social communicators. They simply do as instructed. After fraud takes place, it is practically impossible to get the money back.  
 
Industry use cases 
Timestamping, updates, verification, circulation, data reconciliation, contract management for a variety of industries and documents:
Banking – e.g. transfer confirmations, contracts, terms of use, pricing lists, policies specification etc.
Insurance – e.g. policies terms, contracts, pricing lists, insurance certificates, claims, reinsurance etc.
Education – e.g. diplomas, certificates, training completion proofs etc.
Government – e.g. identity documents, ownership certificates (land, house, flat, business, patents, copyrights), grants, taxes etc.
Broker Dealers – e.g. transaction lists, order confirmations, pricing lists, identity documents etc.
Pharma – e.g. expiry dates, clinical trials data, drug approval certificates etc.
KYC providers – e.g. identity documents, terms of use etc.
Legal – e.g. notarised true copies confirmations, virtual data rooms (VDRs) in M&A processes etc.
 
Roadmap 
PHASE 1: porting (approx. 35 days) 
Since we already have a related prototype of a blockchain-based document verification platform, the first step would be to port the core of the prototype to Cardano from the current private-blockchain backend. The platform allows for verifying 3 types of documents:


public electronic documents such as price lists, terms of use etc. 


private electronic documents such as invoices, letters of credit, bank transfers, insurance certificates etc. 


private paper documents which are the same as private electronic however in a physical paper format. 


 
The platform is by design compliant with EU ""Durable Medium"" regulation and allows to protect the customer (individuals and businesses) from both third-party scammers as well as from dishonest business partners and corporations.
 
PHASE 2: development (approx. 55 days) 
Add relevant, new functionalities such as: 

payment gateways;
Fiat – ADA conversion module; 
enterprise APIs for bulk uploads;
document analytics.

 
and develop further existing functionalities such as: 


more comprehensive upload screen;


sharing options;


UI / UX improvements;


languages update of the interface (currently 14 languages that given improvements and new functionalities will be in need of update).


 
PHASE 3: Pre-commercialisation and beta testing (approx. 90 days) 
The client acquisition would be two-fold: 1) integration with 1 big enterprise that needs to comply by law with ""Durable Medium"" regulations 2) digital promotion of the service among individuals / SME users that need a digital proof of document or action for facilitating their economic activity.
That phase will be used for life testing of the platform as well as collecting experience from enterprises and consumers. At the end we will analyse the results and prepare final changes and desired budget for launching full commercial version of the solution. 
 
PHASE 4: Commercialisation 
The commercialization plan will be based on the following assumptions:
* Acquiring a trusted Partner with recognizable brand to strengthen our marketing message and trust to our service on the market.
* Launching periodic digital marketing campaigns with Partner in social media and information portals.
* Acquiring min. 5 large partners (e.g. financial institutions, telecoms, utility providers) for joint activities who have a customer base and periodically provide them with documents that can be verified, such as invoices, terms of services and their changes, bank statements, demands for payment, etc.
* Acquiring couriers and B2B/B2C on-line retailers (amazon.com, aliexpress.com, allegro.pl) to enable consumers verify messages and documents received from them.
The commercialization phase will be implemented after A series round funding. On a basis of PoC on Cardano we will choose countries with the fastest market adoption. 
 
Budget spending (USD)
We plan the following funding split:

Payroll and contracting fees for developers & analysts – 30 000;
Project administration (PMO, cloud service & support) - 10 000;
Pre-launch testing and final corrections – 3 000;
Market launch & go-live and promotion activities – 12 000;
Market monitoring, platform stabilisation – 5 000. 

 
Our KPI's
We plan to achieve the following project assumptions:

Acquire 2 enterprise class clients;
Acquire 5 000 users (consumers);

 
Success definition
After 3 months: Commercial beta ready for launch
After 6 months: Product launched and running in beta-mode for 2-3 months, insights from first clients incorporated into the product, main marketing campaigns ongoing, first public non-beta users, customer-support processes streamlined
After 12 months: KPI from above met
 
Expected public launch date
[mid November] - Catalyst results
[01.03.22] - Public launch

Background
The team was thankful for the support shown by the Cardano community during Fund 5 and has swiftly delivered on those proposal deliverables.
 
A summary of these deliverables can be found here: https://croesus-blockchain.github.io
 
The rudimentary user interface for our Oracle assessment tool - which we are aiming to extend with this proposal - can be found here:  https://www.croesus-blockchain.com 
 
The Plan
Now that we have the means and capability to assess services in the Cardano ecosystem through on-chain metadata, we want to showcase just how powerful this can be with a set of real-world use cases.
 
Price Oracles
Commonly used to determine exchange rates for on-chain applications and smart contracts.
These oracles can be assessed via a peer analysis. The reported exchange rate compared to other Oracles, or Oracle Pools which are published within the same time period.
 
Random Oracles
Commonly used in lottery, gambling and NFT applications to assign a probability to an event.
These oracles can be assessed through analysis of the spread of results
 
Service Oracles
Bespoke services commonly used to facilitate off-chain processing which may be contingent on large amount of computation or time to determine a result.
 
The Team
Each team member brings over a decade of experience as Data Science professionals responsible for building, assessing, deploying and monitoring credit risk, fraud, sentiment analysis, graph analytics and propensity models.
 
This is the team's second Catalyst proposal. Team members have sufficient experience to deliver all proposal deliverables within two calendar months without sourcing additional developer cost.

The Deliverables
 
User Friendly Meta Data Creation
Current implementation of the protocol is achieved through scripting and while useful for demonstration purposes, further development is required to make meta data submission easy to submit.
 
There are a few different options to pursue:
* create the protocol as a set of smart contracts after smart contracts become possible in early September
* expand on the scripts current in-use
* source a better tool from the community or other proposal groups
 
Start Reporting on Three Different  Real-World Oracle Use Cases
* seek out current Cardano oracles ( eg https://nut.link )
*  report on at least one price oracle, one random oracle and one service oracle using both testnet and mainnet prior to the end of October 2021.
 
Budget
The requested funds will be spent on:
* Incentives and payment for tools that make meta data submission easier (eg as payment to other development groups)
* Incentives to allow Oracles and Oracle Pools to make use of the Croesus Protocol
* Remuneration for two months of development effort, continuing to stand up development infrastructure for testnet and the https://www.croesus-blockchain.com/ demonstration application.
* Development of a Proof-of-Concept to submit protocol transactions via a smart contract

The Cardano BI metadata search engine has been called the ""Google of Cardano Metadata"" and is a vital tool for easy access to Cardano metadata. The tool has been around since January 2021 and is one of our site's most popular functions. The beauty of this search engine is that metadata is readily available as long as you know what the metadata contains. No need to know the address or Cardano internal transaction id's to find a metadata message. Simply search for the text content you remember is part of the message and you can view it. 
Since the search engine was released, a lot has changed. At that time, metadata was new and only used by the community developers for experiments and tests. Today, transaction metadata is used for all kinds of use cases and projects on Cardano and usage is only increasing! The number of potential search hits is increasing with several thousands each day.
To make our search engine even better and ready for a future where simple searches for ""Cardano"" will return millions of search hits, we ask Catalyst for funding of the following enhancements

Let users display search hit list directly if they want. Default today is to display number of search hits
Add more filtering options, for example metadata by type, by key, by month...
Paging functionality to navigate search hits in manageable portions when thousands of hits are returned
Popular / most searched for phrases
Popular / most viewed metadata messages
Highlighting of searched for phrases in result list
Search speed / response time improvements

We expect the search enhancements to be ready within 2 months after proposal funding is secured by the Cardano community voters.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies that are used for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems using an Internet connection. Imagine that this year it is expected that over 25 billion devices are already interconnected using IoT. But one of the big concerns with IoT is security as some of these devices are production line robots or nuclear plants safety systems, followed by scalability as the continuous growth pushes the boundaries of existing technologies.
Smart contracts are agreements between two parties, stored in the Cardano blockchain, that can further enable the execution of contractual arrangements among different parties based on certain criteria being fulfilled. As examples we can think of different scenarios where smart contracts can authorize payments automatically, without any need for human intervention, when the conditions for providing a service have been fulfilled like we are seeing with the successful implementation for VET in the supply chain management or IOTA in the automotive industry.
Smart contracts, due to be released on the Cardano main net on the 12th September, will bring the required innovation to make them a prime candidate for a compelling use case for IoT devices to send and receive data over the Internet without any human interaction, trustless and in a secure way. IoT devices span from everyday consumer products like smartwatches, WiFi-enabled appliances, and wireless headphones, to the intelligent infrastructure powering smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and smart factories, so the market is huge and demand for blockchain solutions in the IoT space will be significant.
Cardano blockchain can support IoT space growth by managing risks around security and scalability concerns associated with IoT:
1️⃣ Because Cardano blockchain system is tamper-proof and furthermore is highly decentralized, IoT can work in a trustless way, without the need for trust among the involved parties. No single entity has control over the huge amount of data generated by IoT devices.
2️⃣ Due to its cryptographic nature, blockchain can store IoT data using an additional security layer that hackers need to overcome to access the network. The level of encryption introduced by Cardano blockchain makes it virtually impossible to tamper with existing data.
3️⃣ Cardano ledger allows authorized people to verify the authenticity of the stored data and track history of transactions in an unheard level of transparency. This can address efficiently any source of data leakages or incorrect data.
4️⃣ Cardano blockchain can process transactions very fast and can makes coordination of billions of connected devices a trivial task. As the scale of IoT space increases, DLT (distributed ledger technology) can ensure a suitable platform to enable the processing of a huge amount of transactions.
5️⃣ Since Cardano blockchain works in a trustless, it ensures IoT organizations and customers can decrease associated costs by making redundant the need for a 3rd party to be compensated for coordinating IoT gateways like in the existing traditional IoT protocols.

Detailed Problem Statement:
According to global reports, food fraud causes US$49 billion in losses to the food industry every year. It involves deliberate deception for profit, including food mislabeling, adulteration, country of origin misrepresentation, weight misrepresentation, nutritional misrepresentation, and repackage. It is a border-less crime that has infiltrated supply chains for profit. No food or place is safe from food fraud, and he rules for controlling food fraud are not perfect.
Existing regulatory measures cannot prevent all criminal activity in this area, and we don't have a system to verify the sourcing and quality of ingredients and in a way that can be done by everyone instantly. In developing countries like India these illegal practices have a much broader impact. For food and beverage manufacturers, growers, manufacturers, processors and retailers, this can have serious consequences in terms of revenue, customer loyalty and reputation.
Consumers are not always able to tell which claims are based on rigorous research and what are just marketing tricks. Food recalls due to E. coli bacteria, salmonella and other pathogens or allergens occur due to lack of visibility of the supply chain and the volume of ingredients coming from n anywhere in the world. This endangers public health and threatens the reputation of the global food industry.
 
Project Description:
Raw material traceability software provides the highest level of physical traceability and transparency available in the supply chain. We use tools like GPS mapping, GIS technology, mobile phones, off-chain oracles, and serialization systems to map the supply chain. Collecting and analyzing large amounts of data using machine learning techniques can automatically deter bad actors.
The app is meant to be an end-to-end design with role-based access control features. In other words, everyone in the supply chain - customers, distributors and vendors - shall make use of it. Customers are free to use the app, with a nominal fee when ordering food from cloud kitchens and restaurants that are equipped with Kitchain. There is also the option for customers choosing to directly purchase raw ingredients. Our existing local food partners and farmers in Tamilnadu shall be onboard as our cloud kitchen pilot initiative, with more onboarding to come as the customer and vendor base increases.
We make every stakeholder visible in the supply chain, providing access to valuable data and alerts to quickly determine if the food is safe and healthy and also optimize the production methods by analyzing the place of wastage. It digitizes secure transactions or ""blocks"" at every point in the supply chain, directly visible to those who have access to this blockchain ledger, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
Traceability allows you to implement corrective actions quickly and efficiently when problems occur. When a food company or government agency identifies a potential food safety problem, an effective traceability system can help isolate and prevent contaminated products from reaching their destination - consumer hands.
While supply chain vulnerabilities are evident in cross-border transport, this project could close the intrusion loop for potential criminals along the supply chain and thus reduce food fraud. Blockchain provides the ability to track in real time, so it is time consuming and does not require potentially malicious document processing.
Creating cloud kitchens in countries like India would reduce the cost of food and make it more affordable when you don't have the expense of hosting customers in the restaurant. The same mobile and web apps used for supply chain tracking can be used as a cloud kitchen platform too. In essence:
A mobile app and a web app anyone can use to trace the origins of the food they are eating.
The new features we plan on introducing in the mobile app is to use Augmented Reality to display the supply chain of the food. For instance, kitchens and farms are largely invisible to customers currently, and our idea is to induce trust by visualizing the supply chain. Other features to be introduced are to be learnt and implemented along the way with feedback and requirements.

Cardano is a public blockchain and open for everyone to post metadata as part of the transactions. Our reports aids the users in verifying the integrity of the data and that the data was saved by a legitimate identity / data owner. 
 
Verifying this is possible using the following two reports:
Hash verification report, you can verify data integrity, that the data has not been changed since links were posted to the Cardano blockchain. Blockchain metadata cannot be tampered with by design thanks to advanced cryptography. Data on company servers or the internet can be tampered with. Using our hash report, any tampering of original data will show up because the on chain hash will not be correct any more
Signature verification report, you can verify that blockchain data was saved to the by the correct identity because you can verify the identities public key and data signatures. Correct signature can only be produced by the valid owner of the identities private key. 
With this proposal we are asking for the Cardano communities support to professionalize this functionality further with web API to enable automatic verification of metadata integrity and ability to share tamper proof verification reports with customers
High-level budget
Development of Web API: $10000
Tamper proofing the reports: $3000
Documentation and user help resources: $2000 
 
Expected delivery
We expect the final solution of this proposal to be launched within 3 months after proposal funding is secured by the Cardano community voters.

An intermediary Dapp would have to have access to ADA funds as collateral on the side of the borrower, and allow the lenders to choose a max amount they're willing to lend, the minimum interest (options would be in ADA, or in USD value of ADA) the lender would like to receive on this loan, as well as the max loan time (be it 5 days, a month, etc.  The customisability here should not be limited).
 
The Dapp would also host a marketplace, of sorts, of all of the active loan offers people have put out there.  From here, borrows can browse or even search for loan offers by metric, and apply for the loan directly to the lender, where they then get the option to look at the appropriate metadata associated with the lender, then a loan offer is either accepted and taken off of the market place, or denied and remains on the market place.
 
I imagine that it also wouldn't be impossible to have a backend calculation on the appropriate metadata to provide also an overall ""borrower's score"" to give an extra piece of information to the lender.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Stable assets should be decentralized and issued by many different institutions. These institutions may have funds insured by the NCUA and FDIC. The Fed [offers auditing services](https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/accounting/daily-statement.html) for these insured accounts. These audits can be made publicly available, and an oracle can compare the quantity of the tokens in circulation to the audited assets backing the token. When a person uses the stable token to make a payment, the smart contract mediating this payment can call the oracle to verify that the asset is in fact still backed and secure the transaction in validation.
I propose to develop a standard with the community that will allow us to audit assets and transact in stable assets from a variety of sources. This is to say that CD accounts will be located in/secured by the Federal Reserve Bank or the National Credit Union Administration. These organizations can provide daily balance statements. In effects, these entities can provide audits for a nominal fee. These audits can be published publicly and thus validate the legitimacy of any token on a given stable token registry. This enables a wallet to group assets based on the results of their audits. Wallets will be able to automatically reject or notify the user during a transaction when a token has failed its daily audit. Otherwise, instead of the user having to keep account of all of his or her stable tokens backed by numerous different banks and thus having various AssetIDs, the end user can simply draw from a secure bag of stable tokens in his or her wallet. The database will also be used to instruct the user on how to redeem the user's CD tokens for their corresponding share of the CD at the bank of issuance. Banks and Credit Unions will ultimately accept and redeem CD tokens issued by other banks and credit unions enabling the stable tokens to be used at ATMs and in other convenient contexts.
Perhaps this could be implemented in conjunction with the Cardano Foundation's [token registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry).
Success in 3 months would be to have a working system that has been released to the public. Success at 6 and 12 months will be rapid adoption.
In terms of funds, I do not have the time to implement this by myself. So, will have to hire a developer from the community for a few months. Thus, $10,000 will be payed for the duration of a 3-month contract. I am open to applications.

UPDATE ON AUGUST 28:
I consider my proposal as not relevant anymore due to the fact that the problem I identified has been solved by the Cardano Foundation themselves after my proposal was submitted.  I'm very happy to see their action in this field!
Please read about it in my re-post LinkedIn here:
https://www.linkedin.com/posts/per-friberg-54207515_cardano-foundation-integrates-coinfirms-activity-6837415079118471168-tB5I
Please read the latest pressrelease about Cardano Foundation's integration if Coinfirms AML product for ADA crypto compliance via this link:
https://www.coinfirm.com/blog/cardano-coinfirm-aml-ada/
The plan for this project depends on the interest from Project Catalyst.I see great opportunities to take a lead with ADA as the preferred and accepted crypto asset for banks and other financial institutions to engage with.
Furthermore, to educate financial institutions will minimise risks with required AML/CTF surveillance and reporting to fully comply with laws and regulations. My view is that this will add value to Cardano's ADA as an asset and to its valuation due to increased demand in relation to other crypto assets, BECAUSE if we to interact and collaborate with regulators and banks proactively to help them comply with AML regulations, it will give us a unique insight and possibility to be their preferred source for knowledge and facts, which will put us in a role as a trustworthy advisor and influencer in the regulatory process and the know-how partner for banks in their AML compliance work.
We need both the regulators and the Financial Institutions on our side to become the global preferred crypto asset! 
And… there is no escape from upcoming AML laws that require knowledge, tools and techs for the financial industry to enable  added value analysis of the Cardano blockchain and become fully compliant with AML regulations.
Please se attached docs. describing more in detail the challenges from the regulators point of view. I see an obvious need for help from the blockchain/crypto industry here. 
After 3 months - Connect and agree on the process
After 6 months - Most of the education, training and strategies forward should be completed
After 12 months - Complete success as the most trusted and serious blockchain/crypto company among Banks, Financial institutions and Regulators. Added value for Cardano is higher demand, acceptance among banks, strong influence in Future regulatory processes and of course, a significantly higher valuation of all Cardano related crypto assets! 
Expected launch is realistic to be expected in early January 2022.
Please read the statement below and consider the expected implications for non-compliance of AML Regulations

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


In India, cases of fake degrees and forged certificates have been rising rapidly in recent years. When that is coupled with increasing unemployment rates, it results in a significant number of candidates applying for every single job position available on the market.
This means for recruiters it becomes an uphill battle to verify the credibility of each applicant's credentials reliably.
We are thus proposing a solution to use the metadata feature of Cardano Blockchain to create a platform that helps Universities, Ed-tech platforms, Recruiters, and degree holders alike to authorize, validate and securely store their certificate records in an easily accessible manner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detailed Problem Statement:
In India and many other developing countries, The process of checking these degree certificates generates a lot of documentation, and storing them digitally necessitates a central authority in charge of managing the records, which opens the door to tampering and data loss. Some academic institutions make it simple and quick to check the validity of their qualifications online, without even asking who needs the information. Others assign the responsibility to third parties (by design or regulation), while others market the service. Finally, there are times when there is no other option but to contact the academic secretary's office at the educational institution to validate the legitimacy of a credential or qualification. Academic degree fraud, on the other hand, is a reality that arises with the involvement of authorities and institutional employees.
India, as a populous country with a large youth population and a gateway to numerous educational opportunities, lacks a consistent, stable, reliable, and tamper-proof method of verifying credentials. This is a significant disadvantage since there are a large number of fraud cases, which slows down the growth of our education sector and job markets. The existing tools available are insufficiently safe to keep fraud to a bare minimum. They, sadly, have numerous flaws and, on top of that, are ineffective in terms of cost.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What we're trying to achieve. (Project Description)

To develop a decentralized application on the top of Cardano's blockchain to combat this serious problem.
Since blockchain technology is resistant to data manipulation, it makes the validation of academic qualifications tamper-proof.
The date (Timestamp) from which a piece of data is recorded cannot be changed and is publicly verifiable which is very crucial to verify the date on which a particular degree is being issued to a student.
There's no need for a central authority.
We will also be deploying smart contracts for special use cases such as degree revocation.

The use of Metadata:

Client (Universities) will upload the content metadata from the digital degree and our platform will encode the metadata and assign it a unique key for each student.
The metadata will then be attached to the transaction as Cardano gives us the ability to add metadata to blockchain transactions and the encoded information will be stamped onto Cardano's blockchain.
Each transaction will use our private native token which will help us with traceability and accountability.
The stamped information will be easily verifiable with our Deqree platform.

We also are working on our prototype that is featured in the given demo. We are adding new functionality everyday and refining our UI/UX. We are welcome to any feedback or suggestions regarding the prototype and also do contact us if you would like to test our product independently. We are also contacting different universities to test our prototype.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some Guiding questions

Why does the target audience care about the solution?
Our solution makes the process of authorizing and validating certificates an easy-to-use and straightforward process.

 

Does the solution need hardware components?
The user can access our services via a smartphone or PC.

 

How does this create value for Cardano?
Our project has the potential to bring in thousands of new users to the Cardano Ecosystem as India's higher education market is estimated to be over 37 million students and currently facing this serious issue.

 
 
Several other such questions have been addressed in the attached white paper.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAQs
1. As the Indian government has a National Academic Depository, will you need to change the whole system at the government level?
A. No, as Deqree can act along with the conventional government system. There is no restriction to that. Also, NAD requires the candidate to provide a set of private information to the verifier and also needs to be pre-registered for that service to work. On top of that, the NAD is slow, time-taking and costly for the end-user while our system is quick and completely free for the end-users.
2. Is your product only restricted to universities?
A. No, as we are also looking forward to bringing Ed-Tech platforms onboard for issuing their online course-based certificates through Deqree.
3. How will you convince any universities to come on board?
A. We have applied to several universities' Incubation cells. We are currently in talks with India's top technical institute and have received positive feedback from them. We are also initially focusing on Ed-tech startups and we will work with them to gain customer feedback, refine our product and improve our services.
4. Do you store private customer data?
A. No, our platform doesn't store anything but generates a unique hash for each certificate and then stamps it via transaction metadata. Since we don't store any private data, we don't need any approval from government bodies under data regulations. 
6. Will you use Atala PRISM?
A. Yes, we will look to integrate it once its SDK becomes publicly available.
5. Do you plan to open-source the project in the future?
A. Yes, after Mainnet launch and a security assessment we will open-source our project.

I already created CardanoWall.com, that provides a working solution.
Level 1 (rolled-out):
There is a concept called Proof of Existence. A hash value of digital data, such as a file, can be included in a transaction. Since the data cannot be changed once on the blockchain, nothing can be added retrospectively, and this hash value cannot be faked. This means that a message with a hash value is proof that your data existed when the message was sent. The blockchain acts as a cryptographic notary who is impartial and inflexible. The algorithm for obtaining a hash sum is a one-way function. You cannot get back the contents of your data from it, and you do not disclose the contents of the data to it.
Level 2 (rolled-out):
I went much further and developed the idea of ""Proof of Existence"" with several new layers. Utilizing cryptography capabilities, you can now anonymously sign your Proof of Existence and, if necessary, prove in court that the data is yours, you are the owner of the private key, and the author of the signed message.
Level 3 (rolled-out):
But this is just the beginning. Using these same solid cryptographic techniques, you can encrypt your data and store it on the public internet. Only you, as the private key owner, can decrypt the data or get a long and complex password to decrypt it. In case of data loss, you have the option to recover the data. Since each file is encrypted with its own secure password, you can share the password from a specific file. Working with keys, encrypting and decrypting data takes place exclusively on your side, in your browser. The keys and the content of the original data are never transmitted to the server. All used encryption and hashing algorithms are reliable and safe to use. Whether you are a book author, musician, photographer, artist, designer, or even a business working with important documents, CardanoWall can help you create concrete proof of your work.
A new feature allows the creation of PoE for any internet page. CardanoWall creates a full-size screenshot + WARC file containing all internal and external elements like images, CSS styles, JS scripts, etc. CardanoWall takes care of the technical part and loads all files in the client's browser to create a PoE record with an additional option to include encrypted versions to CW storage. This feature helps proving the usage of copyrighted materials without permission. It is in demand among lawyers for the protection of intellectual property rights. People can also monitor and save fake news on the internet or store a copy of new official information posted on government websites.
Level4 (in progress):
Currently, I am working on additional features with a clear vision about the next fourth level of PoE that will enable secure and encrypted communication on the Cardano blockchain between parties or additional applications. It will bring more real-life usage and attract businesses to use CW for providing bonus materials tied to a purchased product with an included private key.
Funding
At the moment, I am doing all the back-end/front-end/marketing work myself. Additional funding will allow me to allocate more time to the CardanoWall project, hire a JS developer to improve in-browser encryption of large files, hire advisors to fulfill criteria from courts and legal structures of different countries. It can also cover some costs for CardanoWall public storage/redundancy + additional external servers used for creating screenshot/warc files described in the update above.

Back-end: me, an additional senior JS developer, Cryptography/Cybersecurity specialist, independent security audit for BE and FE: 35000 USD
Front-end: UX/UI improvements as new features appear, redesign: 2500 USD
Infrastructure for 1 year (prod/dev/api servers, storage servers, crawlers for page PoE): 3000 USD
Marketing: additional professional materials to onboard businesses, such as an explainer video I created. Online ads and social networks promotions: 17000 USD

The amount I am asking may seem high, but it's definitely not enough. That's why I also fund the project from the entire profit of my [VICE] stake pool that is producing blocks because of a high pledge I invested in it. By supporting my pool you support the further development of CardanoWall.
https://vicepool.com/
Mentoring
I would be happy to receive support and help from IOHK experts in the form of mentoring in cryptography, which takes a large and important part of the CardanoWall project.
Additional usage
CardanoWall offers much more than I could describe in a short problem statement/solution. You can effortlessly send messages to the Cardano blockchain network without needing to understand the technical goings-on behind the scenes. Your message will become part of the blockchain and will remain there forever. You can also include other types of information other than text, such as an image or geo-position, along with the text message. So it's a Twitter/Instagram built on a blockchain. Some artists already started using CardanoWall as an NFT platform to pass a private key that can decrypt the original artwork. Many new possibilities appear as the project develops with new features.
Roadmap:
Q3 2021: Public API for automatic creation of PoE records without the usage of CardanoWall website.
Q4 2021: An option to use individual wallets/addresses for businesses. Additional features for business accounts.
Q4 2021: Level 4 features for secure encrypted communication and transferring access to CW storage encrypted files.
Q3 2021 - Q1 2022: Building custom solutions for businesses and onboarding more companies for PoE usage on the Cardano blockchain.

See our main proposal for BingoToken - Play-To-Earn : https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/BingoToken-Play-To-Earn/366726-48088
This proposal is to persist the metadata of each game to the Cardano blockchain as  a public, immutable and permanent record of all the relevant data associated with that game.
Goal
Build a nodejs service to execute on game completion which should:
o batch all the BingoToken (and ADA if applicable) distributions into a single transaction
o write the game data (game id, numbers drawn, winner info, winning card numbers) to the Cardano Blockchain to provide immutable proof and auditability of the pseudo-random number generator and winning card numbers.
Execution and Programming Language
This part of the application will be written as a standalone nodejs service which will connect to a websocket of the main application and wait for a message to tell it that a game has been completed. The message will include all the information required for token distribution and the metadata which needs to be written to the blockchain in the transaction.
The service will respond to the main application through a websocket message to indicate success or failure.
We will be writing this as a standalone service so that we can isolate the server running this service along with the cardano-cli from the main application backend to enhance security. It also allows us to make this code available as open source.
Open Source License
This nodejs service will use the MIT License and will be made publicly available in a GitHub repository.
Use of Funding
The funding will be used to complete the development as outlined above.
Metrics of Success - 3 Months
The service should be completed and the source code made available in the publicly available in a GitHub repository within 3 months.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Biggest metadata producers are '' Factories '' .There are too much ınformations that need to be collect , keep in secure , and evaluate.
Thousands of documents are creating in every minutes that are related to production.
If we can use Cardano Blockchain Network to collect , keep secure and evaluate metadata from production , that means all related workers , engineers , managers and machines need to be enter system.
That means ''Millions of new users for Cardano Ecosystem ''
Project targets ;
Target 1 )  We will create ID for any personel who works ın production.
Target 2 ) All ınformations about personel who has ID will be entered to system. Personel ınformation , education ınformation , abilities , production successes , failures about production , quality issues , absenteeism status , special certificates and etc.
Note : Target 2 will be created ''millions of new users for Cardano ecosystem ''
Target 3 ) All machines and equipments will be described with ID and entered to system. This ID will contains all information like ;
**Activation date
**Maintanence history
**Failures that happen on that machine
Target 4 ) All raw materials will be described with ID and entered to system. This ID will contains all information like ;
** Material properties
** Seller informations .
** Dimensional controls
Target 5 )  All necessary production documents like ;
**When production was started and ended ?
**Whic raw material was used ? ( Target 4 )
** How many pieces or process has been completed ?
** Who was responsible for this process. ( Target 2 )
**Which machine or equipment was used ? (Target 3 )
**All maintanences was completed before process ? (Target 3 )
**All Quality control processes was completed ? ( First control - Middle control - End control )
** Which Faults was happened during process ?
All these documents will be entered to system when they created during production. After that , customers who want to buy any ıtem from this factory could know that ;
**Who was produced . Was this person suitable for this process?
**Which raw material was used ? Was this raw material suitable for this project ?
**Which machines was used during production ? Was this machine suitable for this process ?
**All quality informations which was created during production. Is this part / item is correct ?
**All informations about timing . Could this supplier could catch delivery date ?
In same time all these ınformations will create own sub- ecosystem like personel ID . For example ;
When a worker / Engineer wants enter to new job with different company , this company could reach any ınformations from his Personel ID . All sucesses or faults , experiences etc.These informations could not be change or dissapper because of our Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.
So , to reach these type of incredible informations , all factories will start to enter this eco-system.
Also just imagine that , when customers starts to reach all these informations they will start to select these type of products which they can reach any informations like that.
Biggest difference from classical servers , '' These informations could not be change or disappear.
Another benefit will be creating new supply chains for big global companies.
Normally , when global companies wants to give some orders to '' producer factories '' they want to reach same question's answers ;
**Who was produced . Was this person suitable for this process?
**Which raw material was used ? Was this raw material suitable for this project ?
**Which machines was used during production ? Was this machine suitable for this process ?
**All quality informations which was created during production. Is this part / item is correct ?
**All informations about timing . Could this supplier could catch delivery date ?
To check answer of these questions , they need to send 3rd party auditors to these factories. But it is not possible to control all these metadata during any Audit. Also Costs are really high when they want to chose developing countries like '' Africa , middle -east , Asia ''
When we carry on all these ınformations to Cardano Blockchain , they don't need to send any 3rd Parties to control producer factories because they can control from system and they will know that these documents can not be change.
So , all these global companies will not need any 3rd Party auditor companies , to control their suppliers. It totally means '' Decentralized Production '' like removing Banks during cash transfer between Person to Person.
As you can see , this idea will come with lots of sub-ecosystem when we create it.
It will be totally revulation in '' Production ''
 
Timeline for project ;
This pilot will be used in Okursoy A.S in Turkey / Ankara 
 
Step 1 ) 0-30 Days 
General presantation will be created and present to Okursoy team.
 
Step 2 ) 30-120 days   
5 different documents will be selected and will adapted to .txt format to reduce KB of datas.
5 personel from different stages from production will be selected and personel ID will be created. 
5 process line will be selected from different stages from production and machıne ID will be created
5 raw material will be selected from warehouse and ID will be created.
 
Step 3 ) 120-360 days 
Demo application will be created and first trial will be done. First trial will be shared with Global customers. Their feedbacks will be collected.
 
Step 4 ) 1-2 year 
According to feedbacks , all Okursoy team will adapt to system 
 
Funding
*  4 Software Engineer will join team 25.000 $ / year x 2 years
*  Hardware ınvestments  into to production to collect metadata 12.000 $
*  Software ınvestments to create relation between metadata - Cardano ecosystem 18.000 $ 
 
Mentoring
IOHK community feedbacks and supports will be most critical funding for us . Because there will be lots of issue during creating relation between metadata and Cardano Blockchain eco-system.

Providing secure Health Information Systems to Doctors & Health Facilities in Africa making them interoperable citywide or even nationwide.",18,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:53",mavster04,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/mavster04/3096860-48088,,,10000,Requested funds in USD,"

Why Decentralized Health (DeHealth), why now?
There are huge developments in blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) in recent years. DeFi now has lots of useful applications that are now being used by a growing number of people.
On the health side, however, progress has been a bit slow given the challenges. For example, on top of building one's app, one has to consider regulatory compliance, data security, interoperability, and much more which could be time-consuming to do.
But if there is an existing decentralized Healthcare Infrastructure and Platform integrated with Cardano that devs can utilize, this could accelerate more health apps development. Developers can focus on building their health apps on top of the platform, saving months and even years of dev time.
 
But building a Healthcare Infrastructure takes years to build!
Right, that is correct. Fortunately, we have started building this healthcare platform called HAPI Hub (short for Healthcare API Hub) since 2016. You can check its comprehensive API services at www.hapihub.com.
In addition, we also built frontend applications like Electronic Health Records (EHR), Laboratory and Radiology Information Systems, and other health modules. It's called HAPI Cure (also known as www.mycure.md).
 
If they are already built, what else needs to be done?
We plan to further enhance HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure by integrating them in Cardano Blockchain, which adds more security and immutability, enhancing the platform furthermore. This integration module will be called HAPI Chain.
In our estimation, HAPI Chain will take about 8 to 12 weeks to complete.
 
How is it different from other healthcare apps In blockchain?
Well, aside from its already existing HAPI Hub and HAPI Cure platform, it will utilize the significant developments in Zero-Knowlege (zk) proof, a cryptography protocol, where prover (A) can prove that A knows information X to a verifier (B) without sharing any other knowledge to B other than that A knows X. Having this will address the limitation on scalability, privacy, and auditability.
 
Why is the project called HAPI DAO?
HAPI DAO consists of the three aforementioned products - HAPI Hub, HAPI Cure, and HAPI Chain. It will adapt the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) model, popularized and proven to be effective by the likes of MakerDAO and Uniswap. Doing so will help achieve a truly decentralized organizational setup on top of the decentralized ledger provided by the Cardano blockchain.
With such in place, the direction of the organization is directed by the right intentions of the community and not by a central figure. This is especially important for projects like this dealing with people's health records which require utmost security, privacy, and accountability.
 
So, what are practical applications?

Security & Compliance. Around the globe, there are thousands of health facilities (clinics, health centers, hospitals) that are using Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Many of which are not secure and compliant, meaning the health information of patients is at risk of exposure. HAPI DAO can help in this regard.

 

Availability of Solutions. Many of the health facilities don't even have their own medical records system. HAPI Cure already has available solutions like EHR, LIS, RIS, and other health modules that they can use.

 

Health App Development. If one is building a health app, there is a high chance it would need a module for user health records storage. Instead of doing this from scratch, it can utilize HAPI DAO's comprehensive API services instead without worrying about data security and compliance.

 

Standards & Interoperability. Existing systems of health facilities have different providers, meaning they are built differently. Integrating HAPI DAO will make it interoperable with other systems as it follows industry-standard protocols. Imagine a whole town, city, or even a nation's health systems interconnected.

 

Health Information Exchange. A truly decentralized and secure HIE remains elusive, even for advanced countries. But putting Cardano technology + ZK proof with HAPI DAO could ultimately be the holy grail the healthcare industry has long been wanting to achieve. (One great example of this is the Vaccine Passport providers which can use this as a central exchange for validation. In doing so, there would be fewer if no apprehensions at all about data security and privacy.)

Thank you for visiting this proposal,
Ex-colonialisation, lack of knowledge & conditioning has led many Africans to apathy relating to improving their life & excelling, they need the information to show them how to succeed.
To grow Cardano in Africa, we need to show that Cardano is facilitating access to the internet widely and if possible free. This needs to be with hardware as well as software, rolling out programs to supply affordable WiFi routers to shops, cafes and other areas where people gather. Also, though recycling programs supplying computers and smartphones.
We should translate online information into as many African languages & dialects possible.
Lead by example, break the mental links to the past. Show what is possible, from village life to success with solid African examples & fund African mentors to speak to them.
I am proposing to set up the initial system & framework, build a team to find suitable sites and source recycled equipment. This would be followed by building a decentralised organisation to expand on the work in multiple African countries.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

Overview of recent progress
We are building on our successful bid in Fund 5 (see the previous Fund 5 proposal here:****https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Africa-Opensource-Pharma-Medicine/352738-48088)and are close to releasing the MVP which is implemented utilising Plutus.
We expect to have this available before the end of Fund 6 being finalised and will look to launch this with the decentralised tuberculosis drug screening project with some of our key partners (H3D in South Africa, and CRI/INSERM in Europe. Additional partners in Africa e.g. Kumasi Hive in Ghana, MRC Gambia, pioneering labs participating in the ""Africa Grand Challenges"" drug discovery initiative) will be onboarded onto the Fleming ecosystem by the end of this year, or early next year. We will add it in the comments section and our Discord for review.
Please also join our Discord as we would love to actively work with the Cardano community to ensure the success of Fleming Protocol in Africa. This is where you can keep up with our latest progress, and where we plan to share our revised whitepaper, plans/timelines for an****Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISO), and tokenomics/govenrance proposal.
 
Fleming Protocol was recently selected to join the highly competitive Outlier Ventures Base Camp accelerator (https://outlierventures.io/base-camp/), who believe strongly in our vision for drug and medical discovery in Africa. This is exciting news as this will allow us to access their wealth of expertise/experience in the blockchain/Web 3 space (e.g. expertise in go to market strategies, token sale structuring, technical, tokenomics and legal expertise etc) and will open up many doors for more funding amongst other things. As we are likely to incorporate IPFS decentralised data storage as part of Fleming Protocol, we'll also, as a result of the accelerator, have access to the support and expertise of Protocol Labs (https://protocol.ai/), who have extensive and valuable experience building the next generation of decentralised internet applications (e.g. Filecoin, IPFS etc). The accelerator started in early September 2021 and lasts until the end of the year.
 
Overview of Fleming Protocol
Fleming Protocol is a decentralised, open-source drug discovery ecosystem that connects scientists, crowd investors and institutions, enabling the most impactful research to be translated into real-world therapeutics and devices. We believe that such a platform will have tremendous utility in helping Africa overcome its shortfall in pharma/medical R&D and production.
The open-source nature will allow open access to trained scientists within Africa, who can share their expertise in one central respiratory, but also utilise a growing global network of leading scientists/institutions e.g. Inserm, Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI), University of Paris, independent scientists from the citizen science-based JOGL platform, and members/institutions associated with the Open Source Pharma Foundation.
Fleming's cryptoeconomics will present new funding opportunities for open-source R&D, making such efforts sustainable over the long term. Our focus on Africa will allow Cardano stakeholders, with an interest in the region, to support R&D projects that have the potential to create a self-sustaining industry within the continent, and thus reducing Africa's disease burden.
Our ambition is to leverage capital generated from the Fleming ecosystem to jump-start local R&D, provide generic drug manufacturing capabilities and ancillary methods to create safe, effective and available local sources.
We are developing this ecosystem in close collaboration with academic scientists as well as citizen science organisations, e.g. the University of Cape-Town/H3D and the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (CRI) in Paris. This will allow us to build and adapt the infrastructure to host projects ranging from small community-based solutions to large academic drug discovery efforts. These R&D projects would be within the realm of conditions that burden the continent the most.
Please, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/kxmHu5HE
How do we plan to spend Fund 6 funds?
This will go almost exclusively to paying our engineering team, who have a wealth of experience in Haskell and are working extremely hard to develop and launch our MVP on Plutus. Anything left over will be used to raise the profile and brand of Fleming Protocol with the relevant communities.

There is an old tradition in many African societies of resolving disputes ""under the Acacia tree."" Unfortunately, this tradition was not widely reflected in modern systems of law. As a result, there has been an enormous backlog of cases in the legal systems in many African countries. In some places, the backlog is more than a decade long--making it practically impossible to settle disputes over transactions. Recently, a number of countries have addressed this problem by providing new guidelines for dispute resolution and arbitration. For example, Ethiopia recently adopted a new legal framework for the binding arbitration. 
The hope is that blockchain based tools can help resolve the problem. It is commonly said that ""code is law"" when it comes to smart contracts. This is misleading. Most contracts, whether written in natural language or as self-executing code, can give rise to disputes that lead to costly lawsuits. This is true any place a dispute arises, whether that is in the U.S., the EU or in Africa.
Solution: 
The best route to avoid the time, expense and uncertainty associated with lawsuits in African countries such as Ethiopia and Zambia is to take advantage of new legal frameworks for binding arbitration. In order to make this possible, appropriate dispute resolution and arbitration clauses  need to be incorporated as integrated provisions in smart contracts for enterprise level and p2p transactions. We propose to (1) develop educational resources for the Cardano community in Africa about the arbitration process, (2) create a set of readily available legal templates for binding arbitration clauses that developers can incorporate into their dApps to support users making smart agreements, (3) develop a dApp/integration for processing smart arbitration clauses and (4) enlist the help of legal experts and developers in a broad range of countries in Africa.
Plan:
In the first four months of this project, the leaders aim to leverage the efforts of the Kepler SCS team to build legal templates and a dApp for dispute resolution and binding arbitration in the US, EU and UK. See the related Catalyst proposal in the dApp Challenge. Building on this experience, we plan to develop similar templates with a dApp for processing disputes specifically tailored for legal frameworks in African countries. In doing so, the Kepler team aims to cultivate a network of partners on the ground in Ethiopia, Zambia and other countries where Cardano has a growing presence. The Kepler SCS is providing the services of a Catalyst incubator for this project with the expectation that, in time, the individuals on the ground in African countries will move through an accelerator program and then gain greater autonomy in plotting their own path. The team has reached out to iceaddis with the hope of collaborating to build a local project leadership teams.

Labour and B2B Contracts dApp - obviating the need for judicial and police enforcement systems. 
Problem
Most workers do not have formal contracts in developing countries. This can cause problems on both the employer and employee sides. Employees may end up being exploited by businesses that either stall or completely ignore paying their workers. Employers now have an additional layer of assurance against workers not working the contractually obliged hours, causing disruption in production and loss of profits.
Even if there are contracts detailing the above, a number of issues still remain. Firms can quite easily manipulate physical contracts. In regions with poor institutions, seeking justice and enforcement of a contract in a court of law may be very difficult, if not impossible, for most laypeople or smaller businesses. 
Not only can corruption render this process highly unjust, but even if the system is functioning, the very cost of litigation means that unjust actors in the market can get away. This is generally a problem but it is particularly pertinent when there's a large power differential between two market agents, for example in some labour markets. 
How can 3rd gen blockchains solve this? 
Third generation blockchains such as Cardano have features such as ""smart contracts"". These allow users to write code that specifies a number of conditions (if statements), and consequences (then statements). This means that anything that can be digitalised can be a part of either the ""if-statements"" or the ""then-statements"". Even though the digitalisation part limits its usefulness to tasks or events that, in some way, can be digitalised and accessed on the internet, there are still many potential use-areas and ways to get around this. One can imagine a fingerprint scanner at a factory to verify the check-in and check-out times. If someone is working as a salesperson or phone-caller, then the number of calls and time spent on the calls can easily be tracked and logged. This means that the wages are automatically paid if the work has been done. Similarly, if a product has been delivered, then business A's payment will go through to business B.

System to trace coffee from the producers to final costumers, ensuring quality, reputation, and value of its geographical origin.",2,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 23:49",Pipa Leon Cubero,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Pipa-Leon-Cubero/3102566-48088,,,90000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Problem: Coffee from Ethiopia and other African countries are unable to compete for quality, reputation, or value on international markets. Requirements for traceability are almost impossible to implement because of distance, size of production, and lack of access to tools to track the required information. Currently, Ethiopian coffee is protected by Trademark Registration (TR), but Geographical Indicator or Geographical Origin information are critical to international recognition and value of the coffee.
Solution: A block chain system can safely track the coffees' information from its growing location through the long process until it gets to the customer`s hand. This system would provide information on Coffee Geographical Origin, needed for coffee traceability as well as certifications for social equality, fair price, sustainability and environmental responsibility. This would achieve the implementation of a healthy coffee philosophy. This pioneering system would overturn obstacles to opportunity in the African coffee world, benefitting both coffee farmers and helping Ethiopia's economy.
Vision: It is our responsibility to implement technological tools to increase environmental sustainability and competitiveness for essential farm products and eliminate fake processes in Ethiopia.
The Plan
First year: Design, build and implement two coexisting blockchain platforms for coffee in the Yirgacheffe coffee region. Work has already been started with coffee farmers and exporters. They are highly motivated to attain these sustainable certifications.
The rapid introduction of this technology would avoid the learning loop that other coffee countries have gone through as far as environmental impact, and would quickly increase the market value Ethiopian coffee. We would work on the official integration of those tools for national and international coffee politics. This project would also show other African coffee countries how to attain Intellectual property protection (IP) and geographical indication (GI)
Two teams would operate the project: Pipa`s traceability team would manage the direction, co-design, and field work, and a Developer Team would provide the blockchain infrastructure.
11/2021 to 6/2022: Design and building of blockchain infrastructure.
4/2022 to 9/2022:  Pipa`s traceability team would focus on field and knocking doors to offer farmers, cooperatives and certification entities the tools to start working with during and after the next harvesting season.
9/2022 to 11/2022: During harvesting time, we will monitor participation and draw conclusions from the data, to make projections for the next 2 years
Long term The success of this system would lead to its implementation throughout the country as a business line for private and public interests. A second stage would expand the project to the rest of the coffee regions in Ethiopia (2023-2024)
 
Budget:
11/2022 to 11/2023 Total 60,000 USD
Traceability Team : 25000
Logistics: 10000
Travel Expenses: 10000
Specialist Support: 15000
Developers Team: 30000
 
Long term plan/sustainability
This project's sustainability is endless as we expand the network that would produce its reach: coffee producers, environmental activists, entrepreneurs, enthusiastic consumers.
The project will lead the way for a new coffee paradigm in Africa and its emerging economies.

The Mission
Harnessing the power of blockchain technology, Black Rhino will empower users to support endangered species conservation. Our Mission is to raise support + awareness for non-profit conservation organizations, as well as local communities working to protect important natural resources, such as endangered species. We plan to accomplish this through the launch of a cryptocurrency token, exclusive NFT collections, rewards protocols, and a platform which enables cryptocurrency donations + fundraising.
The Why
As human populations continue to grow, so does the number of critically endangered species. Losing key endangered species could cause many important ecosystems around the world to fall apart. Conservation efforts and local communities work together to help preserve, and protect endangered species, as well as their habitats. However, many of these communities and organizations lack the support and infrastructure necessary to maintain these resources properly. Due to this, controversial funding models, like trophy hunting, have become a means of supporting conservation efforts in some areas of the world.
Controversial models like Trophy Hunting are not sustainable solutions. Organizations and local communities rely on the support of individual donors for funding. We must find a way to incentivize & encourage everyday people, as well as local communities in key areas around the world, to participate in supporting endangered species conservation, before it's too late.
The Opportunity
With an estimated $3 Trillion dollars currently circulating in cryptocurrency markets today, and $28 billion in NFT markets, there is an opportunity to create alternative streams of funding for non-profit conservation organizations around the world. 
The How
The Solution we offer is Black Rhino. A way for everyone to democratically support endangered species conservation through the launch of a cryptocurrency token, exclusive NFT collections, and Black Rhino Donation Portals which enable cryptocurrency donations + fundraising, as well as reward donors.
Black Rhino Token ($BRT)
A cryptocurrency token that directly supports non-profit conservation organizations + local communities around the world, voted on democratically by token holders. For every transaction a 10% tax is applied, which is allocated + donated to non-profit organizations, voted on by holders. Holders of $BRT receive rewards for voting, as well as donating to organizations.
Black Rhino Donation Portals
Black Rhino Donation Portals allow for users to donate + support non-profit conservation organizations around the world directly using cryptocurrencies. Users receive rewards in $BRT for every donation or transaction made via Black Rhino Portals.
Since beginning our journey as Black Rhino earlier this year, we've established many connections with many unique wildlife non-profit organizations. We've observed that many of these organizations are aware of the continuously growing opportunities in the cryptocurrency and NFT markets, and want to get involved, but simply don't have the required resources to do so.
This is why a key aspect of our project is to bridge the gap between those organizations and the average blockchain user. In order to do so, we are developing a platform which will facilitate donations done using cryptocurrencies and provide an end-to-end solution for non-profit organizations which will guarantee them increased cash flow from these new markets.
Those who choose to donate + fundraise using Black Rhino Portals will receive $BRT rewards, and exclusive NFTs for each donation as a reward for their kindness. Thus incentivizing users to donate + fundraise. This is a key milestone of our project and delivering it will significantly benefit not only the Cardano ecosystem, but wildlife conservation organizations around the world.
NFTs
Black Rhino NFT collections are created + curated in collaboration with non-profit organizations from all around the world. Collections are made + released in partnership with non-profit conservation organizations  Proceeds from each purchase go directly towards supporting conservation efforts + local communities in partnership with Black Rhino. For organizations that support adoption, we will introduce 'Adoption NFTs', which will allow for purchasers to adopt endangered animals through non-profit organizations, by purchasing + collecting exclusive NFTs.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Langbassadors have noticed that the best way to mass adaption is SSL : Simplify - Summarize - Lift the Language barrier.
We use white board animation videos to apply mind-mapping techniques that help understanding and remembering education given. 
We learned that people new to Blockchain have a ( very typical ) trajectory : Most people came for the money, stayed for the mission. So SNC aims with the Langbassadors program to provide them all the knowledge needed :

first is the general blockchain  & crypto currency education : We have developed the ""What is/ Why is ?"" - series 

 

secondly will be the : ""How to ?""- series, to learn how to buy , acquire and store crypto's & ADA's safely 

 

Thirdly will be a series explaining the unique aspects and opportunities that Cardano offers and the mission we all strive for

 

We also create news & in depth news content in formats tailoring the more seasoned Cardano enthousiast, but not translated in African languages as of yet before 1-3 are provided for in native languages

 
Check out the Roadmap on our website and the Proof of Concepts already established during the Fund5 campaign we ended up getting funded for 12 African LangBassadors for there efforts in making the animations, translating and narrating, for a period of 3 months. That funding will end in November, so SNC and the LangBassador request the continuation of that work.
The languages will be chosen in function of availability of collaborators, and size of the respective language. We have had several candidates coming from the developing countries had to retract due to Covid, and also due to economic catastrophies happening there due to lockdowns. Our core team of hubs have actually managed to grow, and collectively more than 3000 hours have been put in the planning and execution of our plans
This proposal is a continuation of the Fund 5 funded proposal ""ADA news in African Languages"". The team of 12 ( 4 creators - 8 African Language translators ) were funded for a period of 3 months, that will have ended by the time Fund 6 results are in. 
The chosen languages are those who can fund. It's not a limitation, but other languages are on voluntary basis  :
Arabic : 260 million people speak Arabic, biggest African language community - YouTube channel with first content already created 
Luganda : biggest native language in Uganda ( country of 44 million people ) - YouTube Channel with first content already created
Swahili : biggest African dialect spoken by 150 million people ( and in Tanzania, where World Mobile onboards 100000 people via Atala Prism )
Nigeria is among the biggest crypto markets worldwide, with the biggest economy and biggest population ( over 211 million people ), so we produce content in the 3 national languages spoken by 60 % of the population

Igbo
Hausa
Yoruba

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56169917
The other 2 languages covered under the proposal will be chosen out of :

Hebrew ( already a thriving community in Cardano )
Urdu ( Not only spoken in Togo but in total 260 million people worldwide speak Urdu, a large part outside Africa included )
Amharic : Biggest African language in Ethiopia, spoken by roughly 36 million people ( looking for collaborators )
Omoro : Second Biggest African language in Ethiopia, spoken by roughly 32 million people ( looking for collaborators )
Afrikaner : Spoken in South Africa ( looking for collaborators )

 
We welcome all other languages as well, but those will be on voluntary basis at the moment.
General rule : Languages will need to have at least 1 million speakers to be contending, but priority in first phase will go to the larger Language communities.
 
The problem with Crypto risk prevention & education is the KPI dilemma:
It's impossible to tell when the YouTube channels will become popular in which country at what time : 
that will depend mostly on :  

The Cardano foundation
 Where and when the projected 100 million of Africans on Cardano by end 2022 and the 1 billion people on Cardano in 2026 will be implemented

 But once the basic education is published, it generates clicks for years to come
Now in order to do effective Crypto risk Prevention and education, one needs to have enough quality content available to become interesting enough to subscribe on : who subscribes on channels with just a handful of videos ?
But given that creating our first What is ? animation ( duration : 4 min 15 ) , namely : ""What is blockchain ?"" took roughly 40 hours in combined efforts to create and translate and narrate in (almost ) 10 languages so far, it will take an enormous time to make sure the moment blockchain adoption skyrockets through Cardano foundation contracts the channels will be starting to skyrocket in subscribers because so far in many native languages there is hardly ( if any ) information available.
The Uganda LangBassador translating the script took 10 hours for the What is Blockchain ? translation in Luganda ( biggest native community in the country with 44 million inhabitants ), because many cryptocurrency concepts simply don't exist in those languages yet, so he is creating a new crypto lingo. 
 
But it doesn't matter when exactly the implementation of the government contracts will take place, once the videos are created they will serve their purpose for years to come. 
So the question is simply : do you think IOG and the Cardano Foundation can onboard those hundreds of millions of Africans through Atala prism ?
=>If so, crypto risk prevention and high quality education takes so much time that the Langbassadors hope there will be enough time to be ready for when adoption in Africa explodes.
And the fact that Cardano is now being promoted, and teams are slowly formed in many LB language communities already proves that it is worth it.
 
So as KPI, we intend to create minimum 10 videos , each in at least 8 African languages, so basically we will create minimum 80 videos in those 3 months

Target 3 months   :  Minimum 20 videos in 2 Languages
Target 6 months   :  Minimum 40 videos in 4 Languages
Target 12 months :  Minimum 80 videos in 8 Languages

Cost/animation 234 USD
 
The team will have minimum 4 supportive people, currently : 1 script writer / 2 white board animators / 1 English narrator
The rest of the budget asked will be to fund 8 native  speaking African Translators / Narrators. 
Each of the collaborators in making and translating the animation is limited to 520 USD/month as reward with an hourly rate of 25 USD if the total time invested is less than 4 hours/week on average
Total budget for team of 12 working 4 hours/week for 3 months : 520 * 12 * 3 = 18720
FYI : Commercially translations in non European languages cost 45 USD an hour  since machine translations cant be used as a basis :  https://blockchain-translation.com/pricing

According to UN forecasts, Africa is expected to double its population by 2050, from 1 billion to nearly 2.4 billion inhabitants. Half of that population will be less than 25 years old.
World Bank figures show that young people represent 60% of the unemployed population in Africa. Among those who do have a job, the majority work in the informal economy. A report published in 2018, by the International Labour Organization (ILO) on the topic, indicated that 94.9% of people between the ages of 15 and 24 in Africa work in the informal economy. In West Africa this figure is as high as 97.9%.
DRC has the 7th youngest country in the world according to the UN. This presents a unique mix of challenges and opportunities.
With blockchain being the number 1 in demand hard skill of 2020, our proposal seeks to catalyse, cultivate and encourage the burgeoning interest amongst the architects and entrepreneurs of the future in blockchain and related technologies in the digital economy.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Introduction
Current methods of using payment gateways are not possible to use in Ethiopia since the public is not permitted access to the international banking system. There are talks of the national ban lifting restrictions on international banking in Ethiopia, but this will easily take a couple of years before it is implemented. 
This creates a great opportunity for ADA to be the currency of choice until this is implemented, as there are no restrictions on cryptocurrencies.  The Cardano Brand is already big and growing in Ethiopia, and opening up the use of ADA for daily activities will exponentially grow this brand. 
 
Implementation Plan
This Trial Plan will mostly target Venues, events, and networks that are most requested by the urbanites.
We have selected 3 main targets for the first phase of the promotion
1. Event Organizers
2. Tour Organizers
3. Local Bars in the City center
The reason these are selected as first targets is mainly because of the preexisting partnerships I have with merchants in these sectors and also, the large customer base that they have.
 
Marketing:
Customers would get the following benefts for using ADA as payment.

Events: Purchase of early bird tickets at discounted prices with ADA
Tours: Offer discounts if payment is made with ADA
Bars: Free perks and lottery winnings when paying with ADA. Perks will include Cardano Swag, Bonuses in the regular lottery drawing, and ADA awards at regular Trivia Competitions held in most bars. 

 
Merchants would be given guarantees for the first 3 months as well as training on cryptocurrencies and the Cardano ecosystem.
Cardano Logo will be displayed at the Bars and at Events as partners. 
 
Timeline:

Market Analysis: List out Target Merchants and Events for the year 2022 - November 2021
Signup Merchants - December 2021
Implementation and Assistance: Starting January 2022
Trial Finalization: March 2022
Expansion to More merchants (Not included in this proposal): Stating April 2022

 
Budget:

Event Partnership and discounts: 3000 USD 
Perks at Bars: 2000 USD
Tour Package discounts: 2000 USD
Logistics: 500 USD
Training Materials: 500 USD

 
Measure of Success

Partnership with 5events
10bars Signed up
Tour companies signed up
1000 Transactions by March 2021

 
Longterm Plan
We expect these merchants to a springboard to sign up even more merchants in the year 2022.
We have discussed a partnership with the Endubis team to use their upcoming payment telegram bot to facilitate exchanges. 
With the success of this project, we will expand the project to more events and make it a standard for major events and Bars.

Preamble: I am testing waters to see if there is interest in the community, so I do not yet have a detailed plan.  Although from Europe, as a descendent of the continent, I want to give back.  Have been so inspired about the potential for Cardano to finally make a difference in turning around the sad story of the continent from the last centuries.  It is a rich continent full of beautiful people, resources and so much potential - this is Africa's time if people can grab it.
The issue
The main issue is to get around the ""distrust"".  I feel the blockchain is perfect for this: if we have a solution which can prove to investors the records and provenance of those invested in, and vice versa, with deals locked in smart contracts which everybody can agree on before and are audited to be safe from the perspective of the parties, with open trails for all expenditure (vital for auditing : we can be sure our money gets to the right people and is only used for agreed upon purposes, within agreed time-scales and other parameters.  The goal is to create a new eco-system of safe, secure, transparent investment connections which quickly become a kind of gold standard in assurance and best practice.
I envision this as being useful at least as much for non-profits as for commercial companies, because a real concern is always that we want to know our money is getting to the people intended, to the projects intended, being used in the ways intended - whether by NGOs, charities, missions, government ""development"" projects or commercial businesses.  Blockchain can remove game theoretic problems and paradoxes (eg when even ""good"" actors behave badly because they believe everyone else is), and have the potential to transform the landscape and governance - at all levels - within a generation.  Imagine we could see all the records of the historic projects of contractors, we could lock funds and investments in audited smart contracts, could see the full trail of spending and any associated ""paper-trails"" (eg bids for sub-contracting, administration, etc), all payments.  This would boost the level of trust and assurance and create an environment which would encourage best practices, improving standards for all across the continent wherever such systems were adopted.
The  broader aim and vision is actually even grander: that such technologies can ultimately be used to fight and eventually eliminate corruption and distrust in organisations almost completely, by making transparent the flow and use of all operations and funding on publicly audit-able and immutable blockchains.  I envisage this project as a starting point working towards this ultimate guiding goal.   In a de-centralized world, our belief in Africa and Africans no longer needs to be held back by our disappointments in its terrible history of governance, international corporate takeover, or the (ongoing) legacy of colonialism and post-colonialism.
* I think it would be important to have both Africans and non-Africans inputting, so as to maintain perspectives from both inside and outside the continent. 
(funding request guesstimate at this time, envisioning hiring of relevant people and research but I admit I also need help with this as it is out of my primary specialisation/skillset)

African engagement with Catalyst: current limitations
Africa is one of the main focuses of Cardano and Catalyst:

Cardano Africa: https://africa.cardano.org/
Connecting the unconnected and banking the unbaked: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/08/11/connecting-the-unconnected-banking-the-unbanked/
Supporting Ethiopia's Educational System: https://www.appsafrica.com/cardano-launches-blockchain-deployment-in-ethiopia-with-5m-students/ 
Catalyst Challenges such as 'Grow Africa, Grow Cardano'
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26108
and 'DeFi and Microlending for Africa'
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26112

Although, the African community participation in Catalyst itself is still limited. We would like to see this community acting also as builders and active contributors. For this to happen, we need to solve two challenges:

Language barrier: most Catalyst content is made in English, while a large part of African community speak other languages such as French, Arabic and other local languages.
Data consumption: access to the Internet and to data in general is very limited in Africa. Users need to pay for each megabyte they use, and this limits the potential consumption of Catalyst materials already being produced.

 
The Catalyst School: what is it all about?
The Catalyst School is a place created to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles. We onboard new members and help improving their skills along the way, in any way they decide to engage with Catalyst: as a proposer, a Community Advisor, a Veteran Community Advisor or without any specific role within the process.
This project helps the community through live sessions and workshops, 1-to-1 and group support in different languages, interactive website and other workshops related to Catalyst.
Although, for the African community, these might not be the best ways to learn and interact with Catalyst, since most of them are led in English and require a large internet bandwidth and data consumption.
 
Our solution: Catalyst School localized for Africa
With this proposal, we aim at including the African community into the Catalyst process as Proposers, Community Advisors and other roles they would like to take within the process.
To achieve that, we are proposing to:

Create low data learning materials (PDFs, text files, compressed images) and use them to provide all relevant information about Catalyst and how to interact and actively participate in it.
Translate these materials to local languages (French, Arabic and the most spoken African language).
Teach and train African Catalyst members to run Catalyst School sessions within their communities, and also to provide 1-to-1 and group support.

The topics covered by the Catalyst School session and 1-to-1/group support are:

Introduction to Catalyst
Proposing in Catalyst
How to be a Community Advisor
How to be a Veteran Community Advisor

This proposals aims at providing these services for 2 Funds (Funds 8 and 9), according to the roadmap below.
 
Roadmap and Milestones
When funded in Fund 6, the content creation and training will be done during Fund 7, and it will be ready to be delivered in Funds 8 and 9, according to the following schedule:
3 months after funded (end of Fund 7):

Low data learning materials created and translated to local languages.
Local African Catalyst members chosen and trained to run Catalyst School session and provide 1-to-1 and group support.

6 months after funded (end of Fund 8):

Low data learning materials in 4 languages (English + 3 local languages) distributed to the African community.
12 Catalyst School sessions ran (one of each kind per language).
15h of 1-to-1/group support given to local communities.

9 months after funded (end of Fund 9):

Low data learning materials in 4 languages (English + 3 local languages) updated and re-distributed to the African community.
Further 12 Catalyst School sessions ran (one of each kind per language).
Further 15h of 1-to-1/group support given to local communities.

 
Key Metrics

Number of School sessions attendees
Number of participants in the 1-to-1 and group support sessions 
Number of new African Catalyst members
Number of new African Proposers
Number of new African Community Advisors
Number of new African Veteran Community Advisors
Number of new African Voters
Number of new African Referees

This project represents a first step in introducing the Cardano blockchain in Sudan and eventually leveraging the Cardano blockchain in addressing different challenges facing communities throughout the country. This initial introduction will be achieved by achieving two outcomes. A first outcome will result in a large segment of the Sudanese public acquiring access to information in Arabic about Cardano. A second outcome will see the formation of a Cardano Sudan community which will also be part of the global Cadano community.
Specific outputs that will be pursued to achieve these two outcomes include –

Materials and information about Cardano is Arabized and contextualized to the Sudanese context
One (1) communication campaign promoting awareness and education on the Cardano blockchain is implemented
Designing a one-day (4 - 6 Hr) introductory course on the Cardano blockchain;
Enrolling 18 – 20 Cardano blockchain enthusiasts and delivering the Cardano Blockchain Introductory course in Arabic

Activities that will be carried out include –

Carefully selecting and curating sets of information about Cardano to be used for awareness raising
Translating and producing Arabic versions of the information on the CArdano blockchain
Designing and developing a Cardano Sudan educational/information campaign
Implementing the Cardano Sudan campaign
Together with the WADA designing an introductory course on Cardano
Working with 2 to 3 Sudanese Cardano enthusiasts and training them on the delivery of the Cardano introductory course (in both Arabic and English)
Running 4 instances of the Cardano blockchain introductory course with the participation of a total of 15 – 20 Cardano enthusiasts

Performance indicators
The Cardano Sudan educational/information campaign will use different formats to achieve its objectives of having Cardano and blockchain known amongst a large number of Sudanese and will include (i) production of an animation about Cardano in Arabic; (ii) production of a flyer to be advertised on newspapers and social media platforms that conveys information about Cardano; and a press/launch event targeting different audiences (students, fintech companies, government). Through these different formats the campaign will reach an audience of no less than 20,000 persons.
The training/introductory course on Cardano will enroll and be delivered to a maximum of 20 individuals who will receive a certificate recognizing their participation in the course. At the end of the course participants will also be required to open a Daedulus wallet and deposit a minimum amount of ADA equivalent to 20 USD. For each successful deposit Cardano Sudan will make a contribution of 50 USD in ADA.
Budget
An approximate and preliminary budget of 9,900 USD is required for the completion of the awareness raising campaign. Costs include -

Translation costs – 1500 USD
Production of materials and implementation of the education/information campaign – 5000 USD
Delivery costs of the introductory course on Cardano - 2200
ADA contributions towards wallets being opened – 1000 USD
Other costs – 200 USD.

Timeline

Implementation will take 3 months from the date of the award being made.
Monitor, follow-up  and share learnings (4 months to 1 year)

A free database that can be utilized to help the growth of five key sectors in each participating nation: social wellness, healthcare, identity, education, and legal documents. This free software and network will help drastically improve the flow of information, plus productivity of the individual, the government, and the private sector
The SHiELD Dapp Plan on bridging the gap by building a Dapp that the people, government and institutes can utilize to help grow the economy, health, and Social Wellness of the people and Country. This Dapp running on the Cardano blockchain will be self-governed and self treasure taking the financial pressure off of the people and communities. SHiELD provides the Cardano ecosystem with the much-needed massive adoption, not just the five million people in the country of Liberia that we plan the launch in, but within ten years we plan on uploading all 1.2 billion people to the SHiELD-Cardano ecosystem.
 
Description:
Social-Wellness
The blockchain network hosts a community of applications ""within the social wellness sector"" that are designed to assist individuals, businesses, and governments operate more efficiently on a secure decentralized distributed Network.
The social-Wellness section of the network will consist of interactive applications that the public will use on a constant basis. After an individual fully completes the virtual identity section of the blockchain and has received a verification, a AU.SHiELD iD number and a Social-Wellness account is automatically created along with the automatic activation of 3 additional social accounts.
Automatic Activations:
First, the social application will give each and every new activated SHIELD virtual identity account member a free crypto account. The Research Account Wallet (aka Ra Wallet) which will be used to payout individuals for research done with their personal information through our data mining research program by Quadee Kaper Solution. Each individual can choose to opt in or out of this program whenever he or she feels necessary.
Second, the social application will automatically activate a DMV, Customs and Border account for the home Nation State.
Third, the social application will automatically activate a government & censor survey account. This account will be used by government officials to collect up-to-date data.
Health
AU.SHiELD Foundation SHIELD Database plans on creating a skeleton system that Healthcare Providers can build on. Allow doctors and hospitals easy access to patients' health records and cut out all the unnecessary repetitive intake work. AU.SHiELD Foundation Blockchain technology is expected to improve the African medical record management, the insurance claim process, accelerate clinical, biomedical research, advance biomedical, healthcare data ledger, and health research. These expectations are based on the key aspects of blockchain technology, such as decentralized management, immutable audit trail, data provenance, robustness, and improved security and privacy.
We aim to accomplish this goal through our effective SHIELD Desks and SHIELD Ambassador marketing programs.
Identity
""Virtual Identity"" A self-sovereign identity assures privacy and trust, where identity documents are secured, verified and endorsed by permissioned participants.
The SHiELD Virtual Identity Program, SHiELD-iD, or ""SVi
Is a free virtual identity storage and security for everyone in participating African nations. SVi protects citizens' virtual information free of charge and is accessible only to authorized organizations and government officials. The SHiELD-iD database is used to assist 911 operators, emergency workers, police, law enforcement officers, as well as Border and customs agencies in participating Nations States.
Education
A free database that all schools and education institutions would have access to upload their student information on a free distributors network. Students would have access to free courses and financial opportunity.
Virtual Diploma
Online Courses
Talent Management
Legal Documents
The potential to become the main source for transfer of legal documents within the continental borders of Africa is very possible and accomplishable especially with assistance from Blockchain. The physical uploads of documents onto the AU.SHIELD blockchain would gradually increase over time.

Jungle's platform provides digital infrastructure and tools, creating utility of the internet and digitizing the local marketplace for SMEs.",15,"Monday, 23 August 2021 17:37",Kenneth J. Eilor,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Kenneth-J-Eilor/3094601-48088,,,50000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Key Highlights:
JUNGLE is a digital platform that uses digital technology as a tool to tackle the challenges of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) within the modern marketplace. Created from a research-backed development model, JUNGLE recognizes the need for digital technology in today's communities and businesses, especially in the developing world.
JUNGLE's main objective is to close the ever-growing technological gap in low-income and developing communities by developing and deploying a robust digital infrastructure capable of supporting the micro-economic structures (SMEs) within these communities. Our approach to solving the issue of this technological gap is to address the causes that are the lack of; digital infrastructure, connectivity, and digital Inclusion within the communities.
JUNGLE has devised a research-backed set of solutions directly aimed at tackling these issues. Armed with a three-pronged approach we intend to;

Deploy JUNGLE's platform that establishes a digital marketplace, bridging the gap between customers and businesses. This allows these businesses to digitize access to their products and services, with the goal of improving the efficiency of transactions and security for both parties. This encourages the rerouting of a significant portion of these businesses' resources toward product and service quality rather than purely business operational costs. We believe this gives these SMEs a fighting chance against the larger enterprises because the quality of products can rise. This also empowers the modern consumer by creating a diverse business landscape that they can utilize for acquiring product alternatives within their immediate community.
Build a digital framework for community resource management and distribution (LATTICE). Currently, in less technologically advanced communities there exists a need for solutions that allow community leaders access to their constituents. However, the processes applied today are extremely rudimentary and plagued with irregularity. The solutions for these problems exist, but the framework allowing them to be useful and applicable in these communities is yet to be developed. The current pandemic has shown that the most vulnerable in society are the least likely to receive urgent aid to maintain their livelihoods.
Increase the adoption of the internet by deploying immediately useful digital tools that make the Internet a necessity for people in low-income and developing communities. This approach allows the internet to meet these individuals and communities exactly where they are, versus showcasing the capabilities of a system that is of limited immediate utility. Our digital tools will be developed to encourage the use of the internet for everyday services resulting in an increase in the adoption of internet users.

We believe that in order for there to be mass adoption of the Cardano blockchain and platform there must be an immediate utility of the technology it supports. Jungle aims to provide a commercially viable runway for these technologies to be introduced and adopted in Africa. Our initial release of the Jungle platform will focus on providing a digital marketplace for SMEs and a bridge to their prospective customer bases while providing them the necessary digital business infrastructure they need to operate.
Full White Papers will be shared for a more detailed plan.*

Problem Statement

Africa's 150 Billion Dollar healthcare market is as fragmented as its 40 inflationary currencies and 2000 languages, plagued by corruption, mismanagement, and profiteering. In summary mistrust.
This causes a perpetual spiraling of healthcare costs with 90% of the citizens having no cover of any sort.
There is an unserved population of 13.5 million people in Zimbabwe (an African state) due to the fact that they do not meet the strict rules of the insurance actors, but not necessarily because they do not have the money.
Amongst other hardships faced in a region suffering inflation and economic collapse, there are no social welfare initiatives to rely on. An unforeseeable medical condition could literally be your death sentence.
The impact of the government's fiscal policies on the health sector has been devastating. An attached report by Transparency International in 2015 is still very relevant, and the situation was only made direr by the passage of time.
African healthcare, can not be solved strictly by medical insurance models,  or westernized approaches.
The financial model used by leading medical insurance companies (pay as you breathe models) in the neighboring country of South Africa has generated untold riches for their stakeholders but has not delivered universal healthcare.

 
Medical insurance companies profit through;

Justifying higher premiums, by faulting the behaviors of the patients
Creating, and mis-advertising, the coverage of the medical scheme
Putting in comprehensive processes tailored to reject health claims
Outsourcing actual service of healthcare, leading towards collusion
Medical institutions inflate costs, relying on the guarantee of payment from insurance companies

 
Clearly, the problem is large, but there is hope yet in Blockchain!
 
Our Solution
We are not rushing to create the holy grail of medical insurance for Africa. We are going to tackle this problem in stages and we need everyone's help to create a concept, then MVP, then roll it out into a test pilot project
We at Wutano do not believe we need to re-think healthcare. Sacha Robinson, the founder of Wutano and member of the Zimbabwean diaspora, has had a United Kingdom experience and discovered the peace of mind afforded by the UK Nation Health Service, the best system of healthcare in the world and affordable for all. If you are in need you will get treatment on the NHS without discrimination on income or status grounds. 

The Wutano model offers to buy the services of a health practitioner on a capped compensation basis (equating to a full salary in some cases) and in return, the health specialist does not charge any of our Wutano members at the point of service.
Wutano brings to Zimbabwe the practices of NHS, relying not on taxation, but crowd-funded healthcare services governed through fair usage policies. The Wutano, off-chain network has already grown to 200 healthcare providers, with a growth rate of 50 users every month which is being controlled to ensure the community funds pot can afford payments to providers.
The model is also supported by: fair usage practice, share the risk, prioritize access to services based on health-promoting behaviors, and protect the Wutano treasury from bad actors.

 
Anthony Jackson, a Catalyst Community member, and kindred Zimbabwean visionary believes the value proposition of Wutano and the social impact that digitization of the company would bring to Zimbabwe is too great to be limited by the current capacity of the team.

Alongside the existing mechanisms, as summarised above, we desire a smart contract whereby the excess of your medical aid premium is invested on your behalf. In effect, your medical aid contributions to Wutano become an investment, and even possibly a pension. And the very same collective is the healthcare instrument that would provide for the sick, and elderly.
This proposal does not seek to create that smart contract. Wutano has limited comprehension as to what that might entail. Furthermore, without community adoption and suggestions from Blockchain experts, a proposal of that nature would be premature.

 
Use Of Grant Funds
This grant would be used to develop a real-world use case, with the grand design in mind. Using secure no-code platforms, we will rapidly develop the idea and follow patterns that translate to Blockchain.
We have approached healthcare providers in the Wutano network, who are interested in piloting the adoption of Blockchain and are willing to invest their services and assets towards a more liquid healthcare model more resilient and capable of meeting the demands of the sick. 
 
Proposal
We consider this a soft touch of Cardano with the team, to develop value proposals that inspire collaboration and participation in Catalyst from the healthcare providers, while simultaneously developing competencies and relationships needed to fully realize the vision.
We are looking to partner with Blockchain experts and thought leaders in this space, and welcome any collaboration as part of this initiative. We believe strongly in the potential of Wutano, and wish to serve the people as soon as the technology allows.

Applicant's most recent activities report

CheCha, a smart digital voucher system invented by Anthony Jackson (co-proposer) provides a real-world solution for patients to use their small change tokens to pay for their healthcare subscriptions. The project proposers anticipate synergistic value between Checha and Wutano. We strongly believe CheCha will become a street and countrywide voucher that will evolve to match its users' imaginations. We foresee government cooperation in its use that we liken to MPESA of Kenya but with great gas from blockchain that transcends borders to deliver unparalleled and instant convenience.
Wutano has an active project with an engaged user base. Their business model is very inclusive, with an ever-growing partner network. Sacha Robinson will take a leading role in marketing and business development, leveraging his network and team to maximize the value proposition of a Health Blockchain. with over 200 health workforce signed up to serve Wutano subscribers, we anticipate great cooperation and collaboration that will drive adoption of our token model
An existing, thriving piggery project was created with the crowd-farming method and gives us the confidence we can blockchain a Wutano Health token easily. more than 200 families and therefore potential reach of 1000 lives are already an attentive audience through the crowd farming Dung Beetle model. This puts us on a good path to distribute our token idea.

Why build a solution around savings?
Saving is synonymous with foresight. Its importance lies in the possibility of having money for emergencies or unforeseen expenses that may arise in the future, it represents a surplus in the future. There will be good and bad times, that is why saving is vital to have a healthy economy throughout life.
savings = income - expenses.
Why is a savings assistant useful?
Ignorance of the financial world generates high levels of poverty in the world. By receiving specialized information or product, people can make better decisions about their finances because they would then have better analytical tools.
People who have consumed excessively, unaware that in the future their income may not be sufficient to meet their needs.
The remedy to avoid the dangers of over-saving or under-saving is financial planning that takes into account the different stages and environments of our lives. That is why a minimum of financial knowledge or tool is necessary to assess risks and understand opportunities, as well as to analyze the available alternatives.
Financial illiteracy can lead us to make the wrong investments for our future career, to discard viable opportunities and to fail to find the best ways of financing.
Why build an assistant in top of Cardano?
Cardano's vision is about to start driving the adoption of the protocol in places where solutions are most needed, where access to traditional banking and fair access to services is lacking. This is why our Open Decentralized Finance Approach will be at the forefront of pioneering Real financial inclusion and Cardano adotpion in Africa. The project fits perfectly with Cardano's short-term objectives, especially focused on Africa. 
We are delivering the value of money through the Cardano blockchain. These users need support to learn how to manage their savings in this new form of money, all your income and expenses analyzed and under control.
In addition, we are laying the groundwork for adding smart contracts features to boost users holdings and achieve a healthy financial life. Motivate to save, understand personal finance, plan, budget, pay bills etc.
This proposal was born to lay the foundations of a user-friendly mobile wallet, resulting in a simple platform that will facilitate the adoption of Ada and encourage savings, thanks to the application's approach. 
Basic wallet first, ready to grow
We are at the starting point, to later, add functionalities and solutions on DeFi and micro-lending such as the Crowd-Staking mechanism (present as a proposal in the current fund6[0]).
 
COMMON USE CASES
Healthcare: Savers leveraging digital technologies are 3x more likely to be prepared for unpredictable events and emergencies. For instance, low and middle-income countries, which are mostly in Africa pay over 37% of healthcare bills out of pocket due to absent or low health insurance coverage.
Digital financial services, such as Thrift savings and financial intelligence wallet, can help families be ready for unexpected healthcare expenses.
Education: Many families in Africa cannot afford the financial costs of education, education can take about ¹⁄₃ of most African household revenue, on the other hand, for households in high-income countries it's about ¹⁄₅ of the revenue.
Intelligent financial saving assistant will help to label and differentiate expenses, parents plan, project, save and manage education expenses to keep children in school and learning.
Agriculture: Inadequate financial intelligence services makes it difficult for farmers to manage agriculture associated risks, engage in secure income practices, and reduce low return risks associated with cash value chains and untrusted payments.
Decentralized secure savings can help farmers to improve financial resiliency, helping farmers earn more.
Payments: most African population is largely unbanked or underbanked, lacks access to credit and heavily dependent on cash, this adversely affects the promotion of just & inclusive society, increases inequality, limits the growth of MSMEs, increases fraud through cash payments, and makes utility availability difficult.
Thrift wallet financial intelligence will facilitate cryptocurrency based payment which can make pay-as-you-go utility payment, increase access and reduce costs significantly.
The immutable nature of Cardano protocol transactions will significantly reduce costs associated with other payment methods and cash payments.
Promote a fairer African society by reducing inequality through increased income and productivity for rural communities by connecting them to opportunities that are ordinarily out of their reach.
Decentralized supply chain payments can significantly increase revenue for micro, small and medium enterprises.
Climate Change: The United Nations projects a 3–4°C increase in average global temperature by 2100 as a result of increasing CO2 emissions, even with Paris pledges.
The world needs cleaner, greener techs and solutions more than ever, Cardano blockchain based solutions can be used to nudge users further towards projects with low carbon footprints, less CO2 emissions and even help consumers withstand the financial impacts of climate change.
Develop an easy-to-use mobile wallet with financial assistance to drive blockchain adoption in Africa through savings strategy with the Cardano protocol.
Wallet Inheritance: From the survey conducted by PwC in 2013, users valued their digital assets at 25 billion dollars, digital assets ownership and usage has increased astronomically between 2013 and 2021, although there is no recent data to show this. Quadriga CX debacle in 2018 as a result of the death of the company's head; Gerald Cotten, who had the only access to $178M of clients funds is a classical example of digital inheritance importance.
With Thrift smart wallet, users will be able to leave behind their savings, investments and accounts to loved ones, in the event of any incapacitation leading to inability to access the wallet. 
 
DETAILED PROPOSED SOLUTION:
Develop an easy-to-use multi-device mobile wallet to drive the adoption of Cardano in Africa through financial savings, laying the foundation for interaction with decentralized savings systems and open finance. We will implement a smart financial savings assistant to help, motivate and propose suggestions and alternatives to encourage savings through Cardano, informing about the financial health of your accounts by analyzing income and expenses.

ADOPTION:
BLOCKING PROBLEM AND EVIDENCES:
The connection between mobile applications and smart contracts requires libraries compatible with languages such as Java and Swift.
These libraries take longer to implement, so we will first see the connector available for web applications.
For future plans, the final integration with smart contracts to interact with the savings mechanism and other use cases will depend on the availability of the PAB (Plutus Application Backend) implementation by IOHK and, subsequently, adapted to mobile devices.
FUTURE PLANS(not covered in this proposal):
+Use cases. Healthcare, Education, Agriculture, Climate Change.
Integrate the Dapp Connector for interacting with the Crowd-Staking mechanism(fund6[0]), from IOHK.[]
Design and implementation of a financial health qualification system, which helps to better understand the personalized situation of each user.
Interoperability with Atala Prism.
Wallet Inheritance. 
Property rights transfer mechanism.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Summary
• Smallholder farmers verify their identity and link it to their field boundaries. This link allows them to introduce additional information on their crops into the data frame (helping them to build a market identity), as well as through their identity account they can receive monetary funds.
• End-Consumers can access the public information stored on the blockchain directly and contribute funds downstream.
• All intermediates (food processors, traders, other consumers, etc.) can participate by 1) introducing additional information on the products 2) link different products off the supply chain together 3) provide financial incentives downstream for the provision of services.
• Some information on the product chain is public, some are only provided to specific parties. All information provided is automatically processed to introduce and attach impact calculations to the products.
 
Overall project idea:
Delivery
The partners will develop a revolutionary first-of-its-kind digital data frame for inviting supply chain actors' participation towards deriving food products' specific environmental impact from their actual supply chain traceability data. The data frame infrastructure will be able to calculate the environmental impact of all food products in European stores, allowing consumers to make informed food choices, and food suppliers to understand and change their product's specific environmental footprint.


The infrastructure will enable the automated collection of data about production practices through remote sensing based on geo-space technologies. Events such as deforestation and other land-use changes, which have a great influence on environmental footprint, will be tracked and linked to the specific crop that was produced within the automatically detected field boundaries.


that information, together with the collection of data for tracking of transactions of food items along the value chain, will be linked into the Cardano infrastructure. To overcome the complexity generated by the multitude of individual stakeholders each possessing a piece of the supply information, the blockchain represents an innovative and efficient answer to link all those data in one central ledger. This will enable the consolidation of all information for traceability and transparency of the food value chain in an open data and trustworthy way. After the integration and control of those data, the environmental footprint of the product will be calculated using innovative gap filling and data modeling techniques.


Motivation
There is an urgent need to transform our food system in order to tackle climate change. Food consumption is contributing to about 30% of the world's household's GHG emissions, as well as it is at the heart of keeping within other planetary boundaries. As a society, we need to change our food behaviors towards products with lower environmental impact. This change can only be obtained by bringing transparency on the real environmental impact of every food product to the surface, to give all actors along the supply chain – from farm to fork - the means to make better decisions.
Smallholder farmers
We create the incentive to get their story and efforts recognized. As participants, they will be provided with meaningful insights to optimize their farming patterns. Any contribution towards optimizing yields and improving patterns for sustainable fair trade, that is beyond their own capacity, they can directly ask consumers for support.
Supply chain
The project will provide food producers and retailers with a service to obtain trustworthy and detailed environmental footprint calculations of their products as well as the possibility to refine and improve their production environmental impact calculation by integrating their privately owned data. The service will enable them to get a deeper understanding of where to act to improve their product's footprint, as well as the opportunity to visually display the product footprint through logo on pack and be used for marketing purposes.
 
Time schedule
First 3 months:
Crop information and field boundaries are mapped out via satellite images and neural networks. (Hummingbird)
After 6 months:
Through the communication of environmental impacts (modeled CO₂ calculations for millions) of food products based on the available information on the stock control unit (SKU), we incentive players along the supply chain to participate in data collection efforts linking crops towards the end products. (Eaternity)
After 12 months:
Each data contribution is profiled and fits into a scientific framework contributing to higher quality consumer information for the product. (Hestia)
All the data is linked into the blockchain in connection with the ongoing efforts in Atala Prism and Trace. Allowing farmers to receive an ID and claim their agricultural land via a simple and user-friendly interface.
 
Public Launch Date:
October 2022
Later:
At a later stage consumers (of the various production stages), will be able to contribute funds towards the smallholder farmers through voluntary donations, or contractual agreements. For example, an end consumer wants to support the farmer's effort to reduce carbon emissions by using solar panels and directly through the identification provided on the SKU channels donations towards the farmer.
 
Underlying features to be developed to accomplish this project:
Dispute System: Each information introduced to the supply chain needs to be regarded as a not-certain, and stay open to dispute. Hence each information introduced is staked and can be challenged via an oracle so that the verification of the information is converted into a digital asset. For example, farmers claim their field at the point in time of registering through their wallet, and hence it is linked to their personal identity. Each other participant who claims to know different can dispute the fact and third actors and verifications schemes (e.g. governmental agencies) can resolve it.
Private-public hybrid: The framework allows to introduce data that is not completely public, but only accessible to specific actors. For example access to information about production details that should only be used for the impact calculations (e.g. the amount of fertilizer used) is only granted to the impact calculation engine. All data is nevertheless hashed and committed as such to the public blockchain. The container storage and private data access could be handled with content encryption and IPFS hybrid-private networks.
Cascading Identities: To recover and verify identities we introduce a smart Plutus contract, that allows each actor to associate their wallet with other trusted central institutions or persons, for the sake of 1) verifying my identity and 2) to recover funds and identity given the circumstance of lost credentials. These trusted parties will never have access to the private key of the wallet and are only allowed to intervene by the conditions set by the user of the original wallet.
Direct Access Product Scores: For each stock control unit (or SKU; basically any product on a retail market shelf) a unique identity and public URL will always link to the latest and most up-to-date impact assessment result. A simple static website with javascript will query the blockchain and pull the latest information for the display of the product and its environmental ratings.
 
Remark:
The organizations will already contribute about 1.5m € towards this project in December 2021. We are looking for additional funds and partners.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Vision
Spark a new economic paradigm by tokenizing all parts of production chains.
 
Mission
Building the first decentralized industrial network to replace and disrupt a historical exploitative industry with a decentralized and democratic network that incorporates all African producers. This allows them the participation in efficient and transparent value chains to produce at scale for the global market.
 

 
Motivation
We believe in an Africa where everyone has the opportunity to fulfill their personal potential, where everyone can have access to a stable income and growth opportunities. We believe that African economies can grow and prevent mistakes the rest of the world has committed, while building a livelihood for millions of Africans.
We have observed a pattern in the way many African economies are built: The number of formal jobs is limited, so many people turn to run their own small or micro business, often in light manufacturing such as tailoring, carpentry, or else. However, because of a lack of formal education and professionalism, these small businesses only serve the limited domestic market, lack access to capital, and usually do not grow. This is especially evident in the fashion industry. It is the second-largest employer in Africa, but exports from African countries are just a tiny fraction of the global fashion exports.
We believe that this is a huge opportunity – all the resources are already there, they just need to be organized in a better way. With Cardano, we want to make these value chains transparent and efficient and give millions of small businesses access to the global market, as well as the tools to supply it. We aim to create a network that creates incentives to participate, trust and invest in the growth of Africa locally and globally.
 
Model
Manufacturing is the only way to create necessary jobs and enable economic growth in Africa. We decided to start with the fashion industry.
The African continent is naturally decentralized, and imposing centralized industries will repeat all the suffering we can observe in textile production hubs of the world. Imposing centralized structures might also damage many of the natural advantages the African continent has.
Thanks to blockchain, those mistakes can be avoided. The Waya model builds on existing small businesses in the fashion industry and organizes them in a decentralized production system. By aligning incentives and creating a clear path to grow a production business, we open the way to an alternative model of industrialization.
This alternative model of industrialization is transparent, democratic, fair, and makes every participant a beneficiary of the overall growth.
 
How do we do this?
Access to market
The production of a garment is a complex task that includes designing, product development, and sewing, pattern making, fabric sourcing, tailoring, printing, packaging, and shipping. The Waya platform streamlines these production steps and makes it easy for international labels to produce clothing in Africa.
Using Cardano, we can decentralize and organize all these tasks transparently so that small businesses in Africa can take them up. Furthermore, the platform is an aggregator of production capacities. We can split tasks, i.e. divide 5000 pieces into five tailor shops when they only have a capacity of 1000. This way, we provide fashion production at the click of a button while creating value in Africa. Small African businesses can access orders, including the global market's instructions, capital, and materials on their phone. 
Access to working capital
We want African businesses to grow within the network, take up big orders, and reward consistent high standards. That requires working capital. Because of our knowledge regarding the performance of businesses, we can determine a credit rating. This credit ranking is the basis of the platform's internal lending scheme. By providing capital to trustworthy partners, we bridge the funding gap many businesses in Africa struggle with while also fueling the growth of our network.
A transparent and effective value chain
Supply chains in Africa are usually peer to peer and informal. This often leads to higher prices and less efficient systems. We think that decentral value chains have big advantages too such as flexibility and robustness. With the help of Cardano, we can preserve those advantages and eliminate the disadvantages. We map out every part of the supply chain to make it transparent, efficient, and resulting in cheaper products.
 
Implementation
For multiple reasons blockchain is the superior operating system for global and socially ambitious business ventures – and Cardano appears to be by far the cleanest implementation of that vision. Processing payments as well as orchestrating the shipping of real goods and user data at scale – and maybe more importantly, subject to complex and ever-growing business logic - sounds like a nightmare if it were to be handled in the traditional way, meaning: Centralized servers, expensive payment service providers, swathes of papers crossing jurisdictions. While those problems won't magically disappear, a DAO as the heart piece allows pushing the risky bits to the edges - allowing the whole system to at some point spread like ivy over the globe, unbeholden to contingent pettiness of singular fiefdoms.
We devised a somewhat complex scheme – a ""game"" if you will – to ensure the correct functioning of each part of the production process. Since we are already experienced working with Plutus (see mirqur.io - a DEX on Cardano) as well as all the other common constituents of the tech-stack – web-dev, app-dev, backend, even data science and AI (https://gitlab.com/fthagn) – there is no way we can not build something truly beautiful here.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We will offer individuals and businesses the possibility to input and manage their addresses on the blockchain (potentially built on top of Atala Prism). They can optionally make their address information available by 3rd parties (banks, government, individuals, etc.) who request the information in order to grant access to their services (public, financial, health, etc.). The addresses will be both human-readable (e.g. what3words) and machine readable (GPS location).
Front-end entry will be via smartphones but, however, also possible for users which don't own smart phones i.e. entries can be made on behalf of 3rd parties.
Addresses will be classified with respect to their depth of verification. 1. Not-verified 2. Machine verified 3. Peer-verified 4. Institution verified. This classification can in turn be solicited by 3rd parties for decision making e.g. Credit scoring and lending
Those accessing the location information will optionally pay a fee and the users will be optionally rewarded for granting access to their address information.
Examples of Use Cases:
Opening a bank account
Regulators -especially in the CEMAC region- require individuals and businesses to provide some sort of address information to satisfy KYC requirements. This regulatory requirement is satisfied by handing the potential client a piece of paper on which he/she can draw a map indicating her home/business address. The piece of paper is the scanned and filed along with other account opening forms. A verifiable digital alternative will definitely streamline this process.
Due diligence for lending or micro-credit
A reliable and ideally verified address is generally a prerequisite for borrowing. Even access to a micro-credit for access to small loans (most often to women at the market on a daily basis), will only be granted if there is solid reference to where the business or person can be located in case of claims.
Delivery & Recovery
One of the promises of the AfCFTA (African Continental Free Trade Area) is development via intra-African trade. Movement of goods and sometimes services across borders and within countries can only be built on a rock solid addressing system which is often lacking in most countries or remote areas.
Navigation by Humans & Machines
Our solution will make it easier to capture, store & communicate location of individuals and machines in a both human and machine readable manner
Credit scoring
Credit scoring often depends on subtle factors which are sometime even more difficult to capture in Africa. Our multiple level verification could serve as input or entry level for scoring and ranking of individuals credibility and ranking.
Access to Utilities
Access to utility services (esp. water and power) requires mapping and overlapping of plans both from the providers and the consumers. Individuals with identity and location mapped out can be streamlined for access to utility services.
Integration of Emergency and Medical services
The link between identity, location and health (meta)data is the backbone for providing reliable healthcare and medical services. Putting control in the hands of individuals and making the information available as needed is something we hope to contribute towards and to help optimize for productivity and efficiency.
PR and Advertising
Individuals and Businesses can optionally make their identity/location information available for 3rd parties to reach out to them based on their interests. Individuals and businesses can earn rewards for making themselves available for advertising
 
Key Performance Indicators

This supply-chain application features include:

Generate product history and QR code for vendors (printable for manual use sticking to the product package).
Showcase their products and product history 
Take orders
Search by QR code and products category for Merchants
 Online sales encouraged by price discount 

ADA payment is encouraged with discounts and audited into fiat currency to meet the government's requirements.
Small and medium enterprises as the primary target customers.
Target markets of our prospects and how our service comes in:

International market: agriculture/apiculture/Horticulture products exporters like fruits, commodity, honey, and meet. The major value we provide here is the items traceability features.
Domestic market: all edible items and commodities in demand transacting from producers to merchants. Our main value here is the chipper access to items.

Revenue model

Transaction fee from the purchases  
Annual or monthly subscription fee

 
Value Proposition

To Cardano: ADA usage for payment and the Cardano blockchain adoption 
To Users: Avoids expensive middlemen, Avoids Price inflation caused by stacks of middlemen, Easy access, and Traceability of items.

 
Part of the plan is to pursue the business model in the following repeatable and interminable cycles.
 
1. Customer Development and Recruiting:  (2 months)
As we start, we communicate with the Agriculture Transformation Agency (ATA), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and small and medium enterprises and farmers. Introduce our project and understand the details in their problem set, cultivate their understanding of what a blockchain-powered application can do. 
Parallelly, we build efficient team dynamics. We would hire experts needed to build the platform fully engineered as well as sustaining our project as a thriving business. 
Make some effort to understand how they want our solution to fill the gaps in their business by showing the prospects our MVP to give some idea of the solution.
Having the two intact, once we get an agreement from enough prospects, we will proceed to develop the full solution considering their preferences and efficiency.
Hiring experts starts here and continues as a state of road map requires and affords it.
 
2. Product Development: (4moths )
Still keeping our communication with our direct customers, we will go on building the platform in a preferred way and ensuring end-user convenience without violating crucial values like security and visibility of the traceability of tokens.
Project milestones according to the scope and features of the software platform we propose.
 
3. Adoption: (4 months)
We make strategic partnerships with entities including prospective clients to adopt and promote our services along with their own services. We would also give an extended free trial period to use our platform and in return, they will promote it appended to their own regular promotion. 
Commissioned salesmen and women will be employed.
Using the appropriate marketing channel, we spread the news about the value/service we provide to our customer segments
 
4. Scaling: (4 months)
At this stage, maybe in the next round of repeating this cycle, we would raise investment funds from promising investment organizations/groups such as this to support expenses for scaling our service. Scaling up will require us more budget for expanding technical utilities like servers, human resources for the new scope of the project, marketing expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses.
 
5. Sustaining and product improvement (Continous)
Sustaining the project as a full profit organization thriving in the space providing values to the stakeholders in the sector and the general economic aspect of the East-African region and the Middle east.
 
The Opportunities:
The primary target customers will be small and medium enterprises

Perfect timing: Kenya-Ethiopia trade agreement is at a fresh start, Cardano has made an agreement with the Ethiopian government, and huge encouragement innovative solutions for agriculture and agriculture is one of the major development focus currently. First comer advantage is also undeniably important.
Immense demand: Export items including apiculture products have a plethora of demand for the item and the item's history traceability in search of certainty on the quality of the products.
Accessibility of stakeholders: we have enough connections to the producers, others through Minstry of Agriculture. 
Clarity of problem domain: we have a clear view of the issues
Supportive Environment: small and medium enterprises are open to cheaper and tech solutions

The Risks and Challenge:

One challenge is finding a good Plutus smart contract developer and NFT marketplace developer on a budget. Although it's not as difficult if we get help from the Cardano community.
Fortunately enough, risks in the space are quite a few and at the minimum level, most likely not to happen.

Success Measurements:
In general, success would be measured by the progress according to the milestones. Specific measuring points are:

Making key partnership
Meeting project milestones
Meeting client expectation
Good user experience
ADA payment option being well used
Return on investment a year after Adoption stage (3rd on the road map)
Self-sustaining
Early-stage adoption from the land administration office of Addis Ababa, private real estate owners, and end-users.
Customers actually gaining the proposed value
The project becomes self-sufficient after securing two clients.
Enabling services for water and electricity based on clients openness
Start scaling up to the international market after 18 months of successful adoption of the local market

 
Budget plan:
Most of the budget will go to salaries of experts helping to realize the project, here is the plan:
  Three months budget:

Legal consultant or Attorney: $2,500 for 3 months (it may not necessarily be sequential months)
Quality Assurance officer: $3,000 for three months 

Six months budget:

Plutus Smart Contract Developer: $12,000 for 4 months.

The total budget to pull the project to mass scaling to greater market size is 83,810 USD.
We ask for 57,356****USD funds from Cardano to be able to build the product, the team dynamics, get a business license and the customers, and secure a minimum of three clients.
We have plans to raise the remaining 26,454 USD funds later on after establishing the project as a running business, at the scaling stage from other options like Venture Capitals and investment groups.

This blockchain-powered Supply-chain project is inspired by the issues I find in my community issues with edible items price inflation, and several merchants complaints.
Another major problem observed is emerging small/middle size growing enterprises struggling with demand of tracability and trustablity of their products in the international market and my own experience. For instance their is a big demand of honey from Germany in Ethiopia but some of the hone producer I know are loosing the opportunity because they can't provide traceability. Similar issue is experienced in other growing producers.
I obtained these problem observations through the exposure I have got while I was working to establish an agri-tech startup at iceaddis, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
There will be great value in solving the supply chain problem while using Cardano's blockchain and ADA itself.
 
P.S. While writing my proposal, I kept in mind that fashioning this project to become a win-win for our clients, the end-users (clients of our clients), and for Cardano simultaneously, What are the 5 key things that would define the project's success in short and long terms, milestones, estimating a budget for each milestone, which experts to hire and where to find them, how to find and approach prospective clients and understanding their point of view, and way to run the project as a self-sustaining business.
Let's grow Africa, and grow Cardano.

   Lottery ADA Game (LAG) is a Plutus Smart Contract that enable users to play by sending 1 ADA. Any user can play as many times as he/she wants to increase the probabilities to be selected. This contract is based on pure randomness which means that the random player will be the winner at the of every cycle. Each cycle will last about 4,320 slots or 1 days but this is a something that can be set at any interval.After each cycle a winner will be selected, and the funds will be sent directly to the user wallets and the cycle will restart again for the next day. The winner will get 70% of the total fund. This platform would allow anybody around the world to participate as long they can purchase ada. For example, 1 million or less of transaction per day will by forecast for the network?
2% will bet aside use for maintenance fees including infrastructure, developers and daily operations.
18% of the funds will be used to support small stake pools that have less than 2 million live stakes by delegating to them. Eighteen pools will be picked randomly, and they will receive 1% out of 18%
Selection of pools would be based on:
              • How long the pool has been running/seniority.
              • Location
              • Pledge
10% will be used to grow or build African communities such as
        ✓ Support locals' charities with good programs across the continent of Africa. Total charities that
the project can work with are so far:
              • Against Malaria Foundation
              • Schistosomiasis Control Initiative
              • Empower Tanzania
              • Ripple Africa
              • The Barka Foundation
              • Deworm The World Initiative
        ✓ Building and helping grow Cardano communities in French and, in English across Africa because it is sleeping giant. African will play a big role in the crypto world because they are more likely to adopt it.
        ✓ Providing resources to those communities so that they can build and maintain pools across Africa's continent, currently we have less 5 pools across the continent of Africa.

More than 90% of all transactions in Africa are still in Cash and Regulators are imposing strict laws on banking services for Crypto Transactions.
Blockchain adoption has grown in Africa and the conditions for Cardano adoption are ripe as the African continent embraces the freedom of Blockchain. Recently, there has been a sharp increase in peer-to-peer crypto trading across Africa.
According to Dion Guillaume[1]. Trading volume in Nigeria surpassed $99.1 million between January and March 2021, followed by Kenya with $38.4 million, Ghana with $27.4 million and South Africa with $25.8 million. Cryptocurrency trade in these countries has been driven by the continued weakening of local currencies which has especially been adversely weakened due to resurgence of the deadly Coronavirus that has impacted the African economy adversely .
Most people in these countries still rely on cash transactions through the bank to trade cryptocurrencies. However, this has been faced by major challenges as some local governments have come up with strict measures and laws to regulate banking services for crypto which has made it costlier and less profitable to trade. Countries like Nigeria have seen crackdowns on some crypto  being instituted and banning financial institutions from processing transactions related to crypto.
However, peer-to-peer trading seems to be the only option left for crypto traders in the continent, for traders to continue enjoying crypto benefits. Kenya has been ranked the top country in P2P trading with most people trading with each other locally which helps avoid currency differences and charges in banking transactions (Onyango, 2021). We are proposing a cardano Peer to peer exchange where people within a country and region  can trade and transactions can be done easily through cash or through mobile money which attracts less charges compared to banking transactions. This will increase Cardano adoption and allow people to buy and sell Tokens in Cardano Blockchain easily.
 
How The eUXTO P2P ESCROW Protocol Works

There are three participants in a token trade on the P2P protocol , the Buyer, the Seller, and the Arbitrator (ie: the platform)
The token to be sold in the P2P Market is sent to EscrowOrder script with Escrow Datum. The Datum contains four ​​datum hash secrets, SellerHashSecret , BuyerHashSecret, DisputeReleaseSecret, DisputeRevertSecret
The two dispute secrets are owned by the Arbitrator while the buyer and the seller own their respective hash secret.
The Cardano Token is Locked and only spendable by someone who possesses the datum hash secrets of two of the three participants in the trade.

The Escrow Order Script has the following conditions:

Once funds are placed in escrow, Bob (the seller) can release them to Alice (the buyer) at any time, but not take the funds for himself.
Likewise, Alice can allow Bob to have the funds back at any time (cancel the trade), but cannot take the funds for herself.
If Alice and Bob disagree about where the Token should go, they can ask Volibra to decide who is the rightful owner. Volibra (Arbitrator )can then release the funds to Alice, or return the funds to Bob. However, Volibra cannot take the funds for themselves.

For More Information , see our Escrow Order Transaction Flow Diagram attached.
Our goal is to use a hybrid decentralised model, where funds and decisions are always in the hands of the user, and where transactions are governed through smart contracts, registered on the Cardano blockchain.
All transactions on the P2P exchange will be executed with the help of a browser wallet extension like yoroi , that's why we are following the conversation on CIP-0030 | Dapp-Connector proposal (https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/88)
 
Project Challenge:
To provide a safe and secure customer experience in our platform , we are face with the challenge of verifying our users identity. In Africa , just like in most places ,Identity exists in scattered Silos and There is no Discovery Mechanism.
In the short term , We are going to build a Reputation Smart contract to reduce the reputation of bad actors in our system and follow the regulatory compliance of KYC and AML.
In the future , We will incorporate Cardano's Atala PRISM DIDs to enable the issuance of digital identities to our users and  so we can instantly verify them without Government IDs.
 
Impact
I believe the implementation of this project, will reduce the barrier to entry for a typical African with cash to adopt Cardona Blockchain as end users.  secondly as new innovation project launches in Cardano Blockchain , The Africans operating in cash economy would not be left behind.
The opportunity to trade tokens  with cash will have a big impart not just to the growth of Cardano Ecosystem but humanity. Because when everyone, no matter who they are , where they live have access to Cardano Blockchain and financial services, We all thrive .
How does this proposal fit into this challenge?
Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment and platform for mass adoption anywhere

RELEVANT EXPERIENCE
Ed and Keith (see Team bios), with 12 years' experience building and financing MCA in SA, have a track record of accomplishment.  An outgrowth of our original vision was the creation of Indlu Living, our sister firm, about which Charles Hoskinson in 2019 said the following: 
 
PROBLEM STATEMENT EXPANDED
We will merge the critical systems of the Cardano protocol including treasury, incentive, identity and governance systems with MCA, our school with a 10-year history and 120 students. We will do this to enhance the educational experience of our students while at the same time demonstrating the real-world utility of the Cardano protocol in an educational environment.
This is, however, complicated by the following issues:

Inadequate and expensive internet service.
A lack of the basic tools: computers, tablets, and computer training.
Limited technical, knowledge workers to assist with installation and implementation.
A limited supply of developers who can create the smart contracts and design the necessary systems.

SOLUTION STATEMENT EXPANDED
Given Cardano's vision of providing a new financial operating system for the world and particularly for the unbanked and disadvantaged of the world, it makes sense to 1) test its smart contract and treasury concept by improving the process of transferring charitable aid from donors to the MCA's Daedalus treasury account,2) use its token economy incentive system to motivate high levels of academic performance, 3) incorporate Cardano's identity system at MCA to provide our students with a digital identity and finally,  4) adapt Cardano's governance system so that Board members, staff, faculty, students and parents will have a voice in shaping the growth and directions of the school.
Our project represents something of a challenge to Cardano in that it provides an opportunity to test in an existing school with a 10-year history how the basic elements of its protocol can improve the lives of those it claims to want to serve, the unbanked and disadvantaged, particularly in Africa.
ABOUT OUR SCHOOL
With limited resources we have been able to create an independent school of 120 students in eight grades in Kwamhlanga, a poor township, located 60 kilometers north of Pretoria. Our target population is vulnerable children many of whom have lost parents to the AIDS epidemic. Our school, formerly Mukhanyo Christian Academy (MCA) changed its name to Musawenkosi Christian Academy (MCA) several years ago as one of several requirements associated with becoming registered as an independent school with the Department of Education of South Africa. MCA began in 2010 with 20 students, but now has grades R through seven with 120 students, staff of 17 and annual budget of $150,000. To appreciate the reality of the wonderful school which we have established Check out below the 6-minute video**""Kids Helping Kids""** which brings our school to life.
Currently, MCA, which is located on leased property, has purchased a 5-acre permanent site from the tribal chief of the region whose own school was shuttered due to the coronavirus.
CURRENT NEEDS AND OBJECTIVES OF MCA

Our committed teachers are paid 50% to 60% of what teachers in the government schools are paid. One of our objectives is to increase our teachers' compensation, improve teacher retention and create a retirement vehicle by providing each teacher with a Daedalus wallet, seed it with some ADA, and use it to incentivize both retention and excellent teaching.
Our school provides an education in 8 grades from Grade R (kindergarten) through Grade 7. We would like to expand the school to a full R through 12th grade school.
Our newly purchased property has five classrooms but will need significant additional classrooms and administrative facilities to provide for our school's needs. 
We are currently raising funds to build out this property with our sister firm, Indlu Living, of which Keith Brown, one of our team members, is Chairperson. To fully appreciate the current status of our new property and how it will be transformed by a site plan design by Indlu Living with Indlu rental units on the perimeter of the property providing income for the school, download and open the second attached file to see the before and after photos..

GENERAL PLAN
We will create a microcosm of the Cardano protocol and it's constituent elements using Cardano smart contracts to create a token economy at MCA, our existing school of 120 students in grades R through grade seven. This will include:

Treasury System – use smart contracts to link donors to the school's treasury account.
Incentive System – use a tokens based reward system to motivate excellent academic performance.
Identity System – use Cardano's Atala Prism system to create an immutable identity for each student.
Governance System – Adapt Project Catalyst to provide a process for continuous improvement of the school.

DETAIL PLAN
We already have a significant Ada fund which we envision as the start of an endowment for the school. Initially we planned to use some Ada funds through smart contracts to incentivize student performance. Upon further reflection we decided to take a more holistic view of the situation. Consequently, we have taken the following steps and established some preliminary objectives for this project.
PHASE I: BUILDING A FOUNDATION

On May 6, 2021, on a trip to South Africa, Ed Rettig, Ph.D., a behavioral psychologist, introduced the blockchain, the Cardano protocol and Ada to the MCA Board of Directors to gain support for a grant proposal supportive of the idea of using MCA as a test case for the merger of the Cardano protocol with MCA. The Board unanimously approved this plan.
To educate the Board, staff, and faculty members about Cardano we plan to provide all key personnel with the tools, phones, tablets, or computers necessary for operating a Daedalus wallet. We will seed these wallets with a certain amount of Ada. The seed money will be paid for from our current Ada funds.
To ensure adequate internet connectivity we will seek to install a World Mobile repeating station at the school to increase data transfer speeds at a reduced price.
We will also explore and determine the appropriate legal and financial parameters for establishing an MCA school-based Daedalus account for receiving donations and distributing incentives for earned behaviors.
To facilitate this aspect of the program we will need to identify and recruit an individual or individuals with some basic computer and software knowledge to work part time as an implementer(s) with these key personnel. The cost of this aspect of the program will be identified in the budget.

      Parallel with these activities we will begin working immediately on initial contracts identified below.
PHASE II: TESTING INITIAL SMART CONTRACTS
TREASURY SYSTEM – we will build out a process using Plutus and/or Marlowe smart contracts to nurture supportive relationships between donors and members of the school community (students, teachers, staff, and board members). Since we want to use the Treasury to receive donations from external sources without reinforcing the perception of a direct financial linkage between the donor and child and to avoid creating a sense of dependency, building constructive relationships with donors will only be one of many behaviors that may prompt rewards in the student's account. Students will, however, be taught that building positive relationships with a donor is a way for them to support their community. A more direct link between incentives and student academic performance will be established with rewards coming from the school. In this way we want students to learn that there is a direct connection between their performance and the impact on their life outcomes.
Major Donors – seeking a financial return while doing good.
Contract #1- We will demonstrate for major donors the potential return from investing in Cardano's ADA, i.e., 5% compounding reward from staking in an appreciating asset.

We will provide instructions on how to establish an account, stake the ADA and enter the contract.
The donor will be asked in the contract to commit a percentage of the staking rewards (minimum 50%) for a period (minimum one year) with the option to change terms at the end of one year.
Transfer of staking rewards to MCA will be triggered when periodic (perhaps quarterly or semi-annual) reports are sent to the donor.
The contract will be initiated when the donor deposits funds in the smart contract.

Relationship Donors – seeking a personal return in a caring relationship with a student.
Contract #2- Donors will be offered a contract in which they agree for a certain amount of money (e.g., $25 to $35) to be deposited automatically every month.

 Release of these funds will be triggered and sent to the school's treasury account when a student as a participant in the contract sends some metadata in the form of a photo, a letter, test result or other relationship building information. A percentage of these payments (minimum 50%) will be credited to the student's wallet.
Students will be educated in how their behavior supports both the school by strengthening donor relationships and benefits themselves by earning rewards in their Daedalus account.
Given positive experience creating and implementing smart contracts we will, as funding permits, continue to experiment with the application of the Cardano methodology in our educational environment.

PHASE III: 
IMPLEMENTING THE LARGER VISION – even while completing Phase I: Building a Foundation and Phase II: Testing Initial Smart Contracts we will be planning to implement the larger vision. This will be somewhat contingent on the increasing functionality of the Cardano smart contract system and may require additional funding in subsequent funds.
INCENTIVE SYSTEM – we will build a token economy reward system to motivate positive behaviors that support academic excellence and the development of strong character.
Students

Starting with the South African government's curriculum we will identify and define age and grade specific academic achievements and assign some relative value to their completion.
Other behaviors and activities which contribute to character development will also be identified, defined, measured, valued and reinforced.
Performance of identified tasks when confirmed by the teacher will trigger rewards through the system.
Each student will eventually be set up with a Daedalus account available for review periodically upon request and with permission. For the student this may be called their Education Fund.

Teachers and/or Staff

Behaviors for which teachers and/or staff will be rewarded will also be defined with assigned values and rewarded.
Each teacher/staff will be provided with a Daedalus account available for review at any time. For the teacher or staff this may be called their Futures Fund.

IDENTITY SYSTEM – we will integrate Cardano's Atala Prism identity system into MCA's administrative system to create a digital identity for everyone associated with MCA.
Cardano's Prism system

We will reach out to John O'Connor to learn about the system that is being used in Ethiopia with the intent of using this system with our students and staff at MCA.
We will integrate it as much as possible with MCA's current management system.
We will work with each student and his or her family to load identity information (birth certificate, family information, academic certificates, etc.) into Prism.

GOVERNANCE SYSTEM – We will integrate Cardano's governance system into the school's planning and development process and as such will involve the following.

Identify individuals and organizations who should have a voice in determining the direction of future development and continuing improvement of MCA.
Assign relative weight to individuals' and organizations' voting rights.
Submit continuing improvement proposals (CIPs) to the community for assessment, voting and selection.
This may be the most difficult task: trying to adapt the Project Catalyst model to governance at the local level.

NETWORK OF SUPPORTING SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZATIONS – There are many associated schools and organizations with which we have had significant relationships over the years or from which we have received significant support either in the form of funding and/or advice. These and other schools committed to serving children around the world represent the potential market.
PROGRAM DELIVERABLES - It is our conviction that this project will need time to mature because of its size and longer time frame. Some aspects will be contingent on developments in other parts of the Cardano project. Nevertheless, key objectives which we seek in the first two phases are:
Phase I: Building a Foundation – January - March 2022

Provide key personnel with adequate computer and communication equipment for providing access to Cardano and the Daedalus Wallet..
Improve internet connectivity by acquiring and installing a World Mobile repeating station.
Establish appropriate financial, legal, and organizational structure for the program.
Identify and procure adequate on-site implementers to support the program.
Begin creating initial smart contracts

Phase II: Testing Initial Smart Contracts – April– May 2022

Create, test, and install Contact #1 for major donors and sign up at least ten (10) users of the contract.
Create, test, and install Contract #2 for donors seeking to build a personal relationship with a student and sign up at least 10 donors using this contract.
Begin to identify academic behaviors to be rewarded in an incentive program in the 5th, 6th, and 7th grades.

We will initiate our project in January 2022 and anticipate launching our project by the end of June 2022 having met our objectives. Success means that by July 1, 2022 we will continue implementing this project and paying for it with our own funds.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This project proposes to make our library of Cardano educational content available in Swahili. These translated resources will include both written and audio versions of **beginner-friendly** Cardano news, insight, and community resources.
We have established relationships with Swahili translators, and are ready to jump into the work of translation. We are collaborating with a collective of young college grads in Kenya who are starting their careers as technology and journalism professionals. These young people are all native Swahili speakers, educated in English-speaking post-secondary institutions in technical fields. Our translation project is a perfect way to introduce these young African professionals to blockchain concepts, establish grass-roots awareness of Cardano in Kenya, provide resources in the local language, and pave the way for future adoption and development of Cardano by and for African people.
We have a trained linguist and teacher on our team to provide strategic leadership.
Our current website covers Cardano network basics, onboarding paths, news, and insight articles. We invite community involvement by providing an interface to submit new content, comment and respond to existing content, record audio versions of articles, and propose new article ideas. We publish new content weekly, covering breaking news, and Cardano insights, geared toward newcomers and nontechnical audiences. We have 20 articles and pages to translate immediately, and expect to roughly double that number in the next six months. This project would fund the translation of existing and new content for the next six months.
Our website already supports multi-language, including:

Detecting User's preferred language, and presenting content in that language if available.
Allow users to toggle between available languages.
Some content is already available in translation. This project will allow us to continue and expand translated content.

The technical and relational framework built in this phase will allow us to continue translate content written in English as well as source original Swahili content. Language tags, Search Engine Optimization, and grass-roots marketing efforts will be leveraged to spread accessible Cardano resources to new audiences.
 
About Us
We are two Cardano enthusiasts. With our community of contributors, we provide hype-free, educational news and insight about the Cardano network that is accessible to everyone. Most online blockchain content is written by and for developers and finance geeks. We are building a network of contributors who break down complicated technical ideas for everyday people, and provide relevant news in quick bites.
Our website is a resource for anyone who wants to learn what Cardano is, why they should care, and how they can participate. We want to make these resources accessible to as many people as possible.
Darlington is an engineer by day and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist and entrepreneur.
Stephanie is a teacher and technologist with a passion for helping non-profits navigate and capitalize on technology.
Our Kenya team are recent college grads with backgrounds in technology, journalism, and business. This project is an onramp for them to get involved in Cardano, with an eye toward ongoing collaboration.
 
Motivation
We see that the next frontier of growth for Cardano won't be confined to Developer forums and GitHub repositories. Instead, it will be among our friends and neighbors, as they start to see and understand the applications of blockchain technology for their own lives and futures. We hope they will see Cardano as the most exciting project out there, and we want to provide a trusted resource to help them learn, get involved, and contribute.  
 
Our Values
We believe that Cardano is a powerful platform paving the way for a future that works for everyone. To help connect that future with ""everyone"", information and resources must be available to all kinds of people. So we put a high value on accessibility:

Explain groundbreaking technology in simple terms
Provide a User-Friendly interface and thoughtful resources
Meet ADA standards for differently-abled users, including Audio versions of all content
Provide our content in other languages, including Swahili as a key way to reach a large African demographic

 
How big is the market
Nearly 150 million people speak Swahili, making it one of the most useful languages to reach a number of African countries and populations. There's already a robust Cardano community in Tanzania where Swahili is the national language. But there is a need for resources written for everyday people in Swahili.
 
Definitions of Success
Translations of core website content available in Swahili (20 existing pages/articles in translation).
Swahili translations of new Cardano news and insight articles over the next 6 months (additional 20 pages/articles)
Translated Content is being viewed in native-Swahili speaking parts of the globe (as captured in Google Analytics)
 
 
Roadmap
1 Month Milestones: Website UI supports multi-languages, responsive language settings based on end-user language settings, toggling between languages, and participation by community translators. Establish relationships with Swahili translators, and begin gathering translated content.
3 month milestones: All core educational resources on the site is translated and available in Swahili, and a cadence has been established for translating new content (ongoing news, insight, and community-submitted articles)
6 month milestones: Full library of 6 months of new and existing Cardano content is available in Swahili.
Future: Ongoing Spanish content beyond this launch phase can be sponsored by Cardano Community Support and Stake Pool Rewards. Cultivating relationships with our Kenyan team for locally sourced content by and for Swahili speakers. 
 
Budget
$2,500 Translation of 20 existing news, insight and Cardano onboarding articles for beginners. Paying 125/article for written translation.
$2,500 Ongoing translation of 1-2 new articles per week plus other site content in the next 6 months. Article average length is between 500-1000 words, other site content includes additional resources and links for people to learn about Cardano, changing and growing on an ongoing basis.
$1,500 Audio recordings of site content in target language, making resources accessible to more people. This amount allows us to record existing 20 articles, plus new content for the next 6 months.
$1200 Developer Cost to continue the buildout and maintenance of multi-language support. Darlington has donated ~60 hours to build a basic framework for multi-language content. This amount will allow him to spend the time needed to enhance and support the back end of our multi-language content at a discounted rate.
$500 Administrative cost to hire, coordinate, and support translation resources.

Create a blockchain-based land registry solution to expose Cardano in Burkina and to help reduce social tensions due to poor land management",85,"Thursday, 19 August 2021 18:16",Larba Nadieba,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Larba-Nadieba/3098802-48088,Joshua Akpan,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Joshua-Akpan/3054446-48088,63950,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


THE CONTEXT
Land tenure/management and cadastre in sub-Saharan Africa in general and in Burkina Faso, in particular, are going through a serious crisis characterized by:

acute social tensions and increasingly violent and deadly community conflicts leading to communities insurrections/social stand-offs.
illegal land sales
unauthorized occupation of public spaces
destruction of green belt in the cities
anarchic land grabbing
an unreliable land registry
the emergence of disruptive technologies such as Blockchain
the rise of the internet in African countries
 the awareness of political authorities on the need to quickly disarm this simmering social bomb

OUR SOLUTION
As digital transformation experts and social entrepreneurs, we want to address the crucial issues outlined above and contribute in reducing the social tensions due to the failed land management in Sub-Saharan Africa in general and in Burkina Faso in particular by using blockchain as a technological response.
We want to implement a reliable and country-wide electronic land register based on blockchain. To make the process of land management as inclusive as possible we will involve the different key actors of the land management value chain and start a common private initiative in partnership with local authorities (mayors, etc.), landlords and notaries and offer registration services to individuals, communities, and companies. To be sustainable the private initiative with the government of Burkina Faso as key project sponsor will be a cooperative enterprise (in short COOP) governed by the OHADA business law.
Our service offering includes land-id/property verification to:

 individuals, communities, and companies
 financial institutions and banks

To make the service offering accessible to the public, we will create an easy-to-use frontend mobile application for mobile devices and a multitenant website for desktops for real-time verification.
In the second phase, we will create an exchange portal for sellers and buyers (NFT Platform).
In the next steps, we plan to extend the access to the verification service to the majority of the people of Burkina Faso using mostly features phones by integrating USSD platforms of the main mobile operators in Burkina Faso.
In the longer term, we want to expand the activities of iFoncier to neighbouring countries facing the same issues (i.e. Niger).
WHO WE ARE
we are a group of graduated ICT Experts, Electrical engineers and computer scientists, teachers, and social entrepreneurs aiming to contribute to digital inclusion in Africa.
The key founders of the initiative are:

Larba Nadieba: He was born in Burkina Faso and is currently living in Germany. With more than 20 years of accumulated experience in German multinationals (e.g. Siemens), he is currently working as ICT and Digital Transformation Expert Detecon International of Deutsche Telekom (the main German and biggest European Telco Operator). He holds an MBA in International Business specialized in ""the bottom of the pyramid"" markets. Larba is also acting as Guest Lecturer on Blockchain and Emerging Technologies at the Georg Simon Ohm Technical University of Nuremberg/Germany. As a Blockchain enthusiast and advocate for the emergence of disruptive technologies in Africa, Larba has founded in 2018 the West African Blockchain Community (WABC) as a community-based initiative to support the emergence of Blockchain in Africa.

He is an experienced expert in the development of the digital industry in Africa and the focal point in Burkina Faso of the capacity building initiative at Smart Africa (African Single Digital Market). He is currently preparing a doctoral thesis (PhD) on the Blockchain Technology. In 2019 and 2021 he was elected Vice-Chairman of the Government Advisory Committee (GAC) at ICANN. He is the founder of an incubation centre in Burkina Faso and co-founder and general secretary of ITICC (a community-based civil society initiative promoting digital inclusion and digital capacity building in 18 African countries). Rodrigue is co-founder of iFoncier. (https://bf.linkedin.com/in/rodrigue-guiguemde-a588a92b/en)
Philip Schamberger: Philip is a graduated electrical engineer. Over the last 10 years Philip has worked as a patent and innovation manager at Siemens; in that capacity, he helped to bring innovative ideas into the right path. He holds an MBA in International Business. Philip is a social entrepreneur with Africa as his main focus. Philip has accumulated more than 10 years of experience as a social entrepreneur in Africa. Philip is co-founder of iFoncier. (https://www.xing.com/profile/Philip_Schamberger)
Joshua Akpan: Joshua Akpan is a visionary blockchain entrepreneur with a knack for pioneering the initiatives that foster the adoption of blockchain technology in Africa. Founder of POA (a stakepool powered adoption driver) and ABCD a blockchain training program initiative to support young talented developers in Africa looking to explore the blockchain space to build products that are bespoke to Africa. He also co-founded Liqwid Finance- an open-source, algorithmic, and non-custodial interest rate protocol built for lenders, borrowers, and developers. (https://ng.linkedin.com/in/joshua-akpan-59447282)

Beyond the listed 4 key founders, iFoncier has planned additional key roles to be filled by specific senior experts (Smart Contract, DeFi, NFT, DMS, UX/CX, System Architecture, etc).  
To implement the solution, iFoncier will rely on young African developers by partnering with ABCD (African Blockchain Centre for Developers). In addition, the project intends to call upon the creative genius, know-how and experience of experts from the African Diaspora. The senior experts from the Diaspora will be the mentors of the young developers. Our idea is in partnership with other stakeholders and/or subcontractors like ABCD, the Anablers, and the West African Blockchain Community to help to create a critical mass of Blockchain Developers. 

In our RASCI-Matrix ABCD will be responsible for the development coordinated by a senior Blockchain Expert and a senior System Architect.
Larba as Enterprise Architect and Blockchain Expert will take the role of Program Manager.
Philip will be in charge of the financial management. He will be the oversight for the financial resources 
Rodrigue is the Lead System Architect. he will be assisted by another expert in Blockchain and Smart Contract.
Joshua is the interface to the Cardano Community and the expert for NFT topics. 
Gwendal LE DIVECHEN (co-proposer) will be in charge of coordinating the developers. 

The majority of the key team members will be located in Burkina Faso.
 
OUR MISSION
Our mission is to contribute to the digital inclusion of the African continent. We are aiming to bring technological responses to the main social issues in Africa. With our solution, we aim to building credit for all citizens of Burkina Faso owners of a piece of land and helping them secure more a financially stable future and to improve their economic outlook.

Update
This is a resubmission from Fund5 that narrowly missed funding. We have made the following amendments with community input.

Instead creating space that community can come to, we will start by doing more outreach work
Rent spaces for big events as needed.
Make use of some co-working spaces initially as appropriate

Thanks to Steve Lockhart and Gwendal Le Divechen for their help putting the original proposal together and for continuing to champion this proposal.
Purpose of the Project Proposal


As with the Cardano ecosystem in general, in Africa there are parallel threads that need to be working simultaneously. First and foremost among them are the basic infrastructure needs that many in the western world take for granted, but are often things that African localities do not commonly have available at a level that will support the development of such a highly technical ecosystem.   


 Internet access that will support inter-hub and international cyber-meetings as well as stake-pool operations is something that must be pursued and acquired. Electrical supply with UPS integration and backup generators is also something that must be secured as local power companies are often subject to brownouts/blackouts.  


 In addition to those basic needs are also the hardware required to support developers, teachers, students and the associated community outreach each hub is planning. 


 The following list in details what should be standard equipment and services for our community hubs:    



 Facility – (Rental / Maintenance.)
 Power – (Equipment/Installations/Rental/Fuel/Maintenance) 
Internet – (adequate for world communication and stake pool operation)
Networks – (Equipment/Installations/Rental/Subscription)
Insurance - (Safety / Fire / Hazards)
Workstations connected to screens for classes, printers, etc.
 Desks, tables, chairs 


The funds requested for the support of the hubs (investment costs + 3 months recurring costs) will be administered by WADA and will be made available to the individual hubs according to a phased deployment plan . Partner hubs are people with whom we have developed a relationship over the last few months and with whom we share the same goals.

 Main Deliverable:

Accelerate the creation of dapps and attract new developers into the Cardano ecosystem who are attuned to solving local problems.

 
 --------***--IMPACT--***---------
How does the proposal fit into this challenge?

 Africa presents immense opportunity for Cardano blockchain adoption however, the continent's well-documented barriers to adoption could hamper the design of cutting edge digital solutions and the growth of Cardano in Africa. This proposal will Grow Cardano by ensuring the best ground solutions emerges and entrenches Cardano's cutting-edge solutions in the Sub Saharan Africa region. With focus on:


Infrastructure (main purpose of this proposal 
Education
Outreach

  How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?

By supporting and developing these activities, WADA will, thanks to its role as link between people and initiatives, help to simplify and boost the creation and deployment of innovative solutions.

-------***---FEASIBILITY--***-------
Reference & Past Successes:

In August WADA completed a widely successful Proposer outreach program event, significantly increasing our visibility as the go-to for mentoring and onboarding new developers and entrepreneurs from Africa and diaspora. https://twitter.com/jaycidiq/status/1432106218923888640

Risk assessment
As part of our risk assessment process, we identified 3 main areas that require specific attention :

 Legalization: some African administrations are strong in harassing new businesses.
 Coordination/standards.
 Cost over-run.

The possible risk management solutions:
1.Legalization:

Obtain a legal document from which the WADA hubs would be operating. With numerous trade agreements overlapping, a copy of this document can be used for operations anywhere.
Set up new hubs in existing offices or close to a partner developer's office. This would not only give legitimacy in the eyes of potential users, but government officials will not easily distinguish the new business as it will be collaborating with the established one.
Crypto currencies are unregulated in many countries, WADA will ensure adherence to local regulation to any extent possible

2. Coordination/standards:

Issue standards common to each partner hubs.
 Hire the services of local lawyers. Laws in many African countries are relatively similar with standards such as OHADA (Organization for the Harmonization of Corporate Law in Africa).
 Identification stickers to put on all material goods so as to establish ownership. A shared logo, paint and color themes can help ensure the motivation of participants who need to not only see themselves as members of one small hub but members of one large network. These standards will be visually visible through video calls.
The coordinating team must be physically aware of the experience on the ground. At least a visit mid-project to each hub. Ideally, the same person/team would visit all hubs to establish a common assessment.

3. Cost over-runs

Starting a new business/office has unexpected costs. This needs to be taken into account.
Additional to forming new hubs, also find an established business dealing with programming and digital products to partner with.
Actors would need to be compensated. For example, the coordination team. But also, the ""lead"" of each hub, even if it is a business owner. These costs can be symbolic and need not cover the full extend of their involvement as they are either already interested or employed. This will ensure that their keep their focus on the hub.
To ensure functionality, cost items must be arranged in order of priority. We do not want to have bought laptops and printers only to find that there is no money for the office. Ideally, the ranking will ensure that the office can maintain some level of functionality.

 
--------AUDITABILITY-------
What success looks like:

Significant Cardano market expansion in all current and future WADA-active countries through solutions design/ dApp creation, education & outreach, and continuous capacity/capability building. WADA will have a network of hubs or centers in sub-Saharan Africa connected locally, nationally and globally to Cardano and the digital world economy :

Metrics

Identified existing developers and businesses  willing to create on the Cardano protocol
New developers recruited and/or for the Cardano ecosystem
New start-ups willing to create on the Cardano protocol
Number of locally based Stake pools
Increase in Cardano protocol transactions originating from West Africa
Degree of public engagement with our marketing and social media plan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Team:
Hubs/Community Centre Information

WADA (West Africa Decentralized Alliance) is rapidly gaining momentum through its network of hubs in mobilizing local communities to solve local problems using Cardano. By simultaneously opening multiple resource centers/hubs spread over Africa, we will speed up Cardano adoption dramatically.
We have country and subregional hubs operating in West and Central Africa with the first regional hubs in Ghana and Cameroon to provide additional oversight and visibility to other hubs in: Ivory Coast, Senegal, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The network connection creates expansion capacity by leveraging IT hub relationships, government, and academic outreach.
In addition to forming new hubs, WADA will also find established businesses dealing with programming and digital products to partner with.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Please reference the attached proposal for a detailed description of project objectives, approach, expectations, risks, and expenses.
-----------Overview---------------

CASK provides incentives to Africans for performing the basic tasks of becoming Cardano stakeholders, and demonstrating the utility of the Cardano blockchain.
The initial release will focus on providing 'rewards cards,' in the form of Cardano Community Tokens, that can be exchanged at participating retail partners. The retail partner can then return the tokens for fiat and keep the remaining ADA as profit (currently, Cardano requires that 1.59 ADA is sent in this type of Community Token transaction)
Future releases will explore new business models made available with advancements in the Cardano blockchain. This may include stablecoins, smart contracts, and/or Babel fees to create new incentive structures that can reduce operating costs while still incentivizing users and retail partners.
Inspiration for this initiative comes in part from the success of Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, where a grassroots effort led to (at first) hyperlocal Bitcoin acceptance as currency, and eventually to countrywide adoption. Similar opportunities exist for Cardano in Africa where cryptocurrency/blockchain awareness is still limited. The Cardano Foundation's commitment to Africa adoption, along with existing grassroots initiatives like WADA, provide a solid foundation from which to successfully develop CASK.

-----------Impact---------------
How does this proposal's problem statement fit the challenge? (slide 2-3)

This project directly promotes expanding Cardano's utility in Africa, and provides financial incentives to Africans that use Cardano's capabilities.

How will this proposal add value to the Cardano ecosystem? (slide 9)

Demonstrating Cardano's utility in Africa is critical to progressing Cardano's vision on the continent. Cardano must reach critical mass in order to reach its true potential. A means of gaining traction is via establishing network effects at local levels, then expanding.

How will the proposal scale to address future challenges? (slide 7)

While initial business models have been identified for a Phase 1 launch, CASK expects to leverage innovations in future Cardano releases to improve its financial model. This may include: Smart Contracts, Babel Fees, Stablecoins, and DeFi innovations defined by the Cardano community.

-----------Feasibility---------------

West Africa Decentralized Alliance (WADA): Skilled team of Cardano practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across West Africa and the diaspora.
Jon Saginaw: 20+ years experience in Technology Consulting, working with some of the world's most well-known companies. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonsaginaw/
Core team includes: Full Stack Developer (2), Cardano/CASK Operations (1), Implementation Lead in Ghana/DRC (2 part time)

Budget (slide 6, 12)


Slide 6 shows a sample exchange of funds, demonstrating how ADA, Tokens, Fiat, & Goods move across CASK. This view describes how Rewards Card funds will be spent.


Slide 12 shows expected time & material funds for resources and other expenses.


Cost of $24,809 include:


Token Distribution ($10,000)


Development Resources ($13,709)


Material Expenses ($1,100)


Plan (slide 11-12)

An initial 3 month development period (with 3 FTEs and 2 part-time onsite resources) will be followed by 4 months of adoption (with reduced headcount). CASK is targeting implementation with two retail partners in Ghana and the DRC.
Key activities include: developing the CASK website and web application (for distributing Yoroi wallets with ADA/tokens), defining the retail experience with participating retail partners, collecting and analyzing data (fraud detection, customer/store experience), and managing operations for CASK infrastructure (web application, hosting environment, Cardano wallet)

Risks (slide 14)

Key risk include Fraud, ADA Appreciation, and Lack of Adoption
Risk descriptions and mitigation strategies are detailed in the attached document

-----------Auditability---------------
What Success Looks Like (slide 10)


A key goal for the initial release of CASK is to demonstrate Cardano's utility as both a store of value (ADA) and a currency of exchange (Community Tokens).


Additionally, net-positive feedback from participants (users and retail partners) and data collected (digital, physical, onchain) will inform decisions around future project direction and expansion.


Key milestones include:


3 months: working prototype


6 months: circulation of Rewards Cards in 2 locations


12 months: not applicable for this release, but Phase 2 concepts are discussed in the proposal


Metrics (slide 10)

750 new Cardano wallets, with 500 Cardano Native Token purchases
2 locations deployed with CASK rewards card solution

Proposal description
Proposal Introduction https://youtu.be/gqMCWQLFO30 
We have already helped Artists sell over $750,000 worth of NFTs on our platform and we want to help African Artists claim their rightful position on the world stage of NFTs.
We would like to offer the Universities in Africa, the opportunity to participate in our ART competition.
https://youtu.be/lOBXJFQDBio 
We would like to offer any participating University the opportunity to win up to $10,000 in prize money that will be split between the Artists and their Art department.
The competition is FREE to enter.
We are a new platform with a powerful mission to ""Make A Difference"" to Artists all over the world.
We help Artists convert their physical pieces into fully digital NFTs (Non Fungible tokens) and we mint them on the Cardano blockchain.
We want all participating universities to present us with what they feel are the best pieces of art from 3 different students.
This can be any form or medium of art but delivered to us as a digital file, so the possibilities are endless.
The final pieces of work will be minted on the blockchain and sold on our platform.
Our aim is to give young artists a shop window to the world and we look forward to helping identify some of Africa's rising stars of the future.
Tell us your story.
For each piece of Art we will require a a short story about the student who created it.
Tell us a little about their past, where they grew up, their present, the type of Art they currently enjoy and the future they hope to achieve.
In addition each student should convey, a little about what the piece they have created means to them and why they choose to create it.
Finally, a few words from the Art teacher at the university telling the community what they would do with the prize money raised.
The competition is now live and open to all universities across Africa.
OUR MISSION
To truly Make A Difference to the lives of millions of creative people worldwide. To empower them with education and tools that help them to monetise their creatives activities.
WHO WE ARE

WHAT WE DO
As businessmen and as a team, we spend all day thinking about how we can build platforms that provide real world solutions and applications for the Cardano eco system.
Great artists observe everything around them and then infuse what they see into a vision of how life can be.
The crypto space is an intimidating world to many and needs a large amount of demystification
We believe in our ability to take complex processes and transactions and turn them into easy to understand mass adoption solutions.
How the money will be used.
We will use the money to engage with all the African Artists and communities to make sure they understand and join in the competition. This will take a large chunk of administration, web team and graphic design resources.
IMPACT - Testimonials so far.
We have already made a significant impact on the lives of the Artists that we have guided into this space.
We have deliberately worked with Artists from very diverse backgrounds to show other Artists that whatever background they come from, they can enter this space and succeed.
Our next goal is to attract and guide Artists from Africa and help them create outstanding testimonials that inspire others to join them.
We hope to attract hundreds and then thousands of Artists from Africa over the next 12 months and look forward to seeing their work listed on the MAD platform.

Sou Sou - a traditional rotating savings by a group of individuals with one spend per cycle of the ""pot"" collected by one ""hand"".",3,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:59",Nissan Dookeran,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Nissan-Dookeran/3102854-48088,,,150000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Sou Sou is normally zero interest bearing with fiat currency. The ""pot"" (pooled funds) collected every week is awarded to a pre-allocated participant by the ""manager"" of the pool for the duration of the weeks matching the total number of ""hands"" in the pool. A manager may sometimes also be a pool ""hand"" as well and/or take a very small fee for the management of the pool from each pot if they have good community standing as they are trusted with all the money collected each week. 
With the use of DeFi mechanisms and banks like MELD forthcoming, as well as liquidity pools and yield farming through ErgoDEX and others in the back-end, together with on-chain governance voting mechanisms, the traditional system of sou sou can be modernised to produce this management fee by the ""pot"" organiser to compensate for managing the collection and distribution to ""hands"" each savings contribution cycle. This system can be  both a stepping stone for the unbanked or those with less trust in modern banking institution mechanisms into the digital age while also reinforcing the development of good savings habits with a traditionally proven method for teaching this as the system is used in many African and Caribbean regions and amongst their diaspora worldwide to this day.
It is hoped that not only ""hand"" awardees, but also common good goals can also be voted on by each ""hand"" in the pool through on-chain governance. This can see charitable contributions from any additional revenue generated using the backend DeFi mechanisms to then be used by the community for a shared purpose in allocating these funds. Examples in community good initiatives that could benefit could be purely charitable giving such as raising funds for medical aid to an ailing community member, or to support the funding of community sports events, or could be micro-loan driven like to community businesses that are either now starting up, or may be struggling during the Covid cycle to meet expenses depending on the ""hand"" proposals and votes made as they decide what would be the best use of these. The use of recognition NFTs or other on-chain incentive mechanisms can be leveraged as well here to further encourage adoption of community positive behaviors. 
Primarily though, the goal is to encourage continue good savings habits among the community while also bringing the community together towards a common good when it can make a difference. The use of identity systems like Atala Prism can keep track records for good savings committments of ""hands"" and ""managers"" (those who hold the spend rights for the sou sou wallet on chain), or since all participants have to be trusted as ""hands"" or ""managers"" initially have no history, can be used to track the history of their nominee to weight their trustworthiness by others in a ""pot"" before being accepted as a contributor. This is as it does indeed require some trust in ""hands"" who have received their ""pot"" to continue contributing to weekly pots until the full number of cycles have completed.
The project would start with a small circle of trusted ""hands"" as both project members and developers, with each ""hand"" moving on to add referrals to future ""pots"" run in parallel as the code base became more tested and secured and refined based on new member feedback to better serve community needs here. Generated staking revenue from funds held in escrow or within delegated investments not allocated to community good initiatives would be locked until such a time as the project is deemed mature and on-chain governance proposal and voting can be done to reward the project founders and participants as seen fit at this time.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Panther Protocol team's relevant experience consists of design/review of 6 Layer-1 protocols and 12 dApps, 29+ years between co-founders, worked on over 40+ protocols, raised +$1BN USD at BlackRock, and Fabric Ventures (Web3 focused venture capital firm backed by the European Investment Fund and privacy-first Web3 founders) and early ConsenSys alumni.
PLAN IN DETAIL
Big Idea: Bring DeFi to Cardano.
Product: Wallet integration and interchain DEX.
Business Model: Incentivized privacy, with a novel pricing mechanism for privacy.
Traction: Discussions with top-tier Layer 1 protocols and multi-national institutions and successful private sale raises totaling $8mm USD--last round at $0.20.
Market: Cardano is the third largest protocol, bridging the Layer 1s to DeFi allows for double digit multiples of TVL.
Phases:
Phase I (4 months) - Research: Define scope, level of effort to build the MVP on Cardano
Phase II (month 7) - Tooling: Integrate with Panther MVP
Phase III (to follow phase II) - Build the privacy solution for Cardano users - interchain DEX
Competition: Panther Protocol's unique selling proposition (USP) is that there is no other protocol that provides (1) privacy, (2) anti-money laundering (AML), and (3) know your customer (KYC) / compliance. Competitors (Tornado Cash, Aztec, Monero and Anoma) have a high barrier to entry to redesign their protocols and have not considered this in their positioning in the market. In essence, Panther gives users the ability to disclose their financial transactions to systems and institutions that require trust (AML and KYC / compliance), yet retain privacy.
Growth: By combining Cardano's technical, engineering, and marketing prowess and jointly building the interchain privacy DEX, Panther will lean on its close ties to Tier 1 financial institutions to facilitate on ramping to DeFi through Cardano.

Problem statement:
How can developers of DeFi dApps create smart contracts for home mortgages and autoloans when standard contractual provisions vary from state to state? How can we bring the expertise of mortgage brokers and auto finance agents into the Cardano community?
Solution: 
In order to avoid the limitations of having smart contracts that are written for 50 different state jurisdictions, we seek to create templates on a modular approach that will work in multiple states. The templates for each part of the contracts will be written in natural language, Plutus and Marlowe. Team members will create informational resources for home and auto finance professionals to explain the advantages of smart contract and defi loan options.
Experience:

David Watts, business systems oriented on the problems of blockchain scalability.
Kip Moyer, home mortgage consultant
Justin Mcallister, auto loan officer for a major auto manufacturer 
Jeffrey Downard, professor specializing in law, ethics and logic. Director of collaborative projects to build educational resources, director of crowdsourcing project.
David Chan, serial entrepreneur and business consultant
Board of Advisors: https://www.keplerscs.com/our-team-1

IP:
Open workshop on Zoom in both a live and recorded form. The educational resources will be publicly available via a Youtube channel. The templates will be freely available for developers and dApp users in the Cardano community.
Defining success:
A workshop with participants drawn from the home mortgage and auto finance communities. An integrated set of video tutorials on the use of smart contracts for defi loans. A set of templates for smart agreements written in both natural language and Plutus.
Timeline and Budget:
Phase 1:

Months 1-3:  Legal Research on choice of home mortgage and auto finance clauses in smart contracts:  ($5,000)
Months 2-3:  Workshop budget including coordinator and assistant ($2000)
Website development and and Youtube channel:  ($2000)
Months 2-4:  Creation and editing of an integrated set of video tutorials on the proper use of defi provisions in smart contracts for mortgages and auto loans. ($3000)
Months 3-5:  Development of templates for smart agreements written in both natural language and a design for a dApp to process the clauses in Plutus and Marlowe: ($18,000)
Months 1-4:  Project direction ($14,500)
Months 1-4:  Project oversight and evaluation by members of Board of Advisors, 4 months, ($14,000)
Months 2-4:  Regular updates and final report to Catalyst community: ($500)
Total: ($59,000)
Months 5-9: transition to Phase 2 of the project

Our team is committed to the effective use of Catalyst funds to achieve the goals of the project and support the larger Cardano community. Towards this end, we are committed to procedural safeguards in the form of oversight by a board of advisors with a wide range of areas of expertise in finance, accounting, startups and IP. The board is providing oversight and auditing functions as a guarantee.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Plan: community oracle price-feeds
Our proposal is to allocate 100% of the funding towards setting up and maintaining free community price feeds (through our decentralized oracle solution) for the top cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin/Cash, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance, etc) for at least 12 months -- accessible to an unlimited number of projects.
 
1:1 Match of funding
The Charli3 team will match 1:1 (potentially more) the level of funding we receive from Catalyst too! So, 25,000USD becomes 50,000 USD for the community. Our goal with raising more funds is to increase the period these price feeds will be available and to offer a greater variety of price feeds or even randomness generation.
 
Building a long term community price-feed
We see the funding as a chance to kick-start a long-term program to support new projects. It would be great to have the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and perhaps other partners match the Catalyst funding to further enlarge what's freely available to the community right off the bat! :) 
As an instrumental middleware component of the Cardano ecosystem, Charli3 is in a great position to support under funded but high value projects that will form the foundation of the ecosystem. 
Our ultimate goal is to maintain these feeds for many years, even forever!
 
MEASURING SUCCESS:
Charli3's Community Price Feed Mission:
1 month goal: community price feeds for approx. the top cryptocurrencies are available to all projects (ETA. before launch)
3-6 month goal: projects using our price feeds successfully launch 
12 month goal: additional data feeds are included to the community, we are able to extend the availability of these feeds for 3 more years
 
Achievement Goals:
1: ZERO Cardano projects delay or cancel launch due to lack of basic crypto price feeds
2: Over 1000 active Cardano projects using our price feeds.

Background
Minswap DEX is an automated multi-pool market maker for the Cardano ecosystem. We are an engineering-first team that is committed to a fair-launch, community-led project. We are bootstrapping builders who are committed to Cardano and decentralization. 
A protocol security audit of all Minswap smart contracts will be conducted by FP Complete - https://www.fpcomplete.com/. FP Complete has completed security audits for Cardano and Hedera Hashgraph.
Minswap has been working hard to ensure that Cardano DeFi users will have a safe, secure place to trade tokens upon mainnet launch. As early participants in the Alonzo White and Purple testnets we've been continually improving our contract designs for months. We have arranged a security audit with FP Complete, a Haskell specialist that has worked on projects with IOG in the past. Their experience with Cardano as well as security audits of DEXs on other blockchains gives us a high degree of confidence in their work. 
Minswap completed the first successful demo of a DEX smart contract written in Plutus over 3 months ago:

Technical Specification
- Manual code review, feedback, revision
- Unit and integration testing, identify unit test gaps, new test writes, re-test
- Review documentation, identify areas for improvement, revise, review revisions  
Funding
Total: $75,000
Budget Breakdown
This covers our initial audit of $62,500 + an additional $12,500 budgeted for our Yield Farming Contracts.
Signed an NDA regarding exact rates and engineering hours involved.
Definition of Success
1 month: Launching prototype on testnet with constant-product pool.
3 months: Complete audit and launch on the mainnet.
6 months: Launch yield farming, StableSwap pool and have basic DAO governance.
12 months: Become the leading DEX and launchpad for Cardano projects.
Features
Fair Launch: No pre-mine, no pre-sale. MIN tokens are distributed fairly with only 10% allocated to development funds.
Yield Farming: MIN tokens are rewarded to liquidity providers who stake their liquidity pool tokens.
Launchpool: Supporting new projects in Cardano ecosystem with Initial DEX Offering (IDO) and Initial Farm Offering (IFO).
Permissionless: Anybody can list tokens without permission. Anybody can trade tokens without KYC.
Community First: All trading fees go directly to liquidity providers. MIN token holders can vote democratically on protocol changes.
Ethereum Compatible: With ERC-20 Converter, users can trade Ethereum tokens at much lower fees.
Stake Pool Operators Support: Minswap supports the SPOs by a community-oriented ADA delegation policy and automatic native token fees conversion. (more details in FAQ)

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Many times Charles Hoskinson called Silvio Micali the most clever cryptographer in the industry. Definitely, Algorand is one of the most interesting and promising blockchains with Pure Proof-of-stake and cheap transactions. There are things both Algorand and Cardan can learn from each other. 
At the moment, the biggest use of Algorand-Cardano bridge might be in DeFi space. Smart-contracts are coming to Cardano, but with the recent price raise transactions in Cardano are already expensive (especially if we consider the necessity to do many micro-transactions, move NFTs and native assets, tokens which at the beginning have 0 prices) 
If such a bridge will be implemented, Cardano can profit from the low transaction fees in the Algorand, and both Cardano and Algorand can profit from bigger interoperability, dapps, future possible cooperation, etc.
 
For this particular proposal, we propose to conduct R&D (Research and development) on the possibility and best ways to create such a bridge. All work will be published as open-source and shared with Cardano community (on forum, reddit) and crypto-blogs
There will be two Senior developers, one with the focused knowledge in Cardano, another one - in Algorand

1 Senior Cardano developer - $3500
1 Senior Algorand developer - $3500

The Milkomeda Oracle will take advantage of the novel sidechain tech being deployed to easily onboard existing oracle solutions from the Ethereum ecosystem and allow users on Cardano mainnet to make requests directly from Plutus.
M1 is an EVM-based sidechain being deployed via the Milkomeda protocol that will be connected to the Cardano mainnet. Given that it is EVM-based, integration with oracle networks that are already live and running within the Ethereum ecosystem will be trivial.
The Solidity contracts and off-chain stack of the oracle networks can simply be ported to M1 and run with little to no extra work. Thus by partnering with one of these oracle projects we can have an oracle solution within the Cardano ecosystem without reinventing the wheel.
This however only solves half of the problem for the Cardano ecosystem at large. This oracle data which will live on M1 will not be directly accessible to Plutus smart contracts unless we build out the infrastructure to facilitate it.
As such we are proposing to build the Milkomeda Oracle. By wrapping an existing oracle network with a wrapped smart contract layer we can allow users to call the oracles from Cardano mainnet and have the response be sent directly back to the mainchain for them to use.
In practical terms, users will create a Plutus transaction which holds the oracle request information inside of its Datum and provide sufficient ADA to cover the oracle fee. Thanks to the fact that both the Milkomeda Oracle and the M1 sidechain use wADA as their base/fee currency, this provides a seamless experience for users as they are not required to purchase another token to use the oracle.
After creating their request, the Milkomeda sidechain bridge will move it to the M1 sidechain, where it will then be passed through the wrapped smart contract layer and then acted upon by the partnered oracle network. Once the oracle network produces the requested data on the M1 sidechain, the wrapped smart contract layer forwards it to the sidechain bridge which then finally moves it back to the Cardano mainchain.
On the mainchain a new UTXO is created which is locked under a Plutus contract that only allows the person who requested the oracle data to consume it. This will be customizable to either be enforced via pubkey (signature) or via token (currency ID).
The sidechain bridge will also automatically provide a timestamping service for all oracle data, meaning that any Milkomeda Oracle output UTXOs will be easy to use in DeFi protocols. Because the datapoint will be time stamped as a part of the UTXO datum, it will be readable within the Plutus contracts which will be consuming the oracle data. Thus the smart contracts can gauge the ""freshness"" of the oracle data, allow certain actions to be taken or not taken based on how old the data is, and even off-chain code can easily make judgements whether another request should be sent to the Milkomeda Oracle to fetch a fresher datapoint.
The Milkomeda Oracle will provide the Cardano ecosystem an opportunity to build off of the work already done by existing oracle networks while taking advantage of both the benefits of sidechain tech as well as Plutus itself.

Introduction
An index is a market portfolio (benchmark) tracking the performance of a group of assets selected and weighted in accordance to the benchmark specification. As the result indexes allow investment into the entire crypto market and its sectors, such as DeFi projects, DEXes, NFTs, etc.
The advantages of investing into index, compared to manual portfolio management are
- wider market exposure, helping to avoid 100X market gems, and ensuring more stable returns,
- balance against single asset failures - if one DEX fails to perform then other in the portfolio will absorb its share, hence in that sense the risk is neutral as the index represents the entire sector (in this example DEXes).
 
Examples of indexes from the world of traditional finance and crypto:
- S&P 500 tracking composed 500 largest companies stocks weighted by market capitalisation representative of the entire US economy;
- FTSE 100 - 100 largest companies listed on the UK exchanges weighted according to their market cap;
- (Ethereum) DeFi Pulse Index: https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi , tracking the performance 25 largest Ethereum DeFi projects according to the composition formula (each project capped at 25% max allocation), balanced monthly.
 
Problem
Alonzo HFC event leads to the rapid development of Cardano DApp ecosystem. 
This means that
- among so many projects it'll be very easy to miss a lot of hidden 100X gems;
- focus on seizing all investment opportunities;
- risk management and understanding;
- access to higher barrier to entry projects (NFTs, private sales, etc.);
- for many people it will be hard to achieve market benchmark returns, but index is exactly the definition of the benchmark returns.
 
Index performs 2 important roles from the investor point of view:
- gives wide exposure to the market;
- is a passive investment, user invest funds into the index, and doesn't have to perform any other actions, index itself is managed to the composition formula;
- it's sectors benchmark - essential on-chain data allowing for the evaluation of all other investment possibilities using Share ratio (comparing excess return to the excess risk measured using volatility).
 
Solution
We propose implementation of on-chain financial indexes of 3 broad types:
- financial (fungible token) indexes - investing in fungible tokens representing different projects share / internal currencies;
- NFT indexes - index composed of NFTs bought and sold based on the current price, valuation, and market sentiments, starting with art, but with t he growth of NFTs in the future potentially also representing all the deeds stored on the blockchain;
- Cardano delegation index - an aggregated way to delegate ADA via smart contract to a portfolio of pools according to a specified condition, e.g. single stake pool operators, ecosystem developers, mission-driven pools, etc. Each pool considered for the index would need to mean the block production and reward requirements.
 
The index protocol would consume on-chain price Oracle, reserve, and other data, according to the index specification, and each cycle (T = 6 epochs = 30 days) would rebalance the index according to the new parameters

Features
We've got a unique and refreshing approach to DeFi.
For full description check our site: https://maladex.com/#features.
But, to outline our approach in the area of passive and active investment:
- capital efficiency - connecting investment capital to projects by passive and active managed of user resources;
- risk control - we build risk control mechanisms into the protocol;
- alpha generation and accessibility - unique and novel ways of generating returns and exposing users to wider range of investment; for instance consider ability to participate in early investment rounds by pulling user funds, by managing risk portfolio by investing into a diversified portfolio, by opening a new investment streams such as NFT collectables, and more.
- powerful tokenomics - we've got one token for all our projects, and check how much we work on at https://maladex.com/#roadmap, and we not only have fair launch, we plan on distributing the token to the wide community to engage everything in the protocol and its decentralisation via the shared ownership.
- one of a kind team - people with experience akin to our are not interested in DeFi because their day to day job pay exceedingly well and they are surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the industry, we however base our decisions on the goals of decentralisation and wide access to means of increasing financial wealth (hence financial revolution), we put our hearts into the project because we want DeFi as the concept to be successful and Cardano as a blockchain, and we build the future in which we want to live ourselves.

Glossary
We start by introducing a series of concepts important for decentralised market making. We suggest that you read it first, as on top of being dictionary of terms used throughout the proposal, information about those terms that you might not be aware of (e.g. did you know that money can be thought of as energy when modelling financial markets)?
 
Liquidity - ease of exchanging one asset for the other without affecting the asset price, at the perceived current market value. Naturally the most liquid asset is fiat currency, for instance USD can be exchanged for many assets around the world, it is used in international settlements, and the payments performed by individual organisations, regardless how large do not affect the price of USD.
 
Model - mathematical description / definition of system, e.g. liquidity model defining how liquidity pool models market dynamics in the response to trades. However, even a poor model can be used for the purpose of modelling, but it will suffer from many inefficiencies (lagging behind the actual state, being too sensitive / having too high inertia, etc.). All CFMM AMM are poor liquidity models (see below for definition of AMM and CFMM).
 
AMM - automated market maker; a liquidity definition as a supply formula enabling automatic (autonomous - without the presence of maker) trades, preserving certain properties such as path independence (the execution price is not depending on the history of transactions), and for trading without any active interaction from the maker party (makers provide assets into the liquidity pool which are then managed based on pool model / formula).
 
CFMM (constant-function market maker) - AMM model using constant function; the most famous example is Uniswap v1/v2 model of x * y = const.
 
Maker - party providing liquidity to the market (pool); i.e. making the market (making it possible for trades to execute).
 
Taker - party exchanging on the market (e.g. swapping token X for Y).
 
Quantitative Finance - scientific field using mathematical and statistical modelling for the purpose of investment management. Quant finance enables modelling of complex stochastic (random processes) and building efficient models and accurate predictions. Quant finance is used heavily in traditional finance in modelling markets, managing risk, making both automated and manual investment decisions, to name a few.
 
DEX (decentralised exchange) - non-custodial exchange executing trades on-chain.
 
TradFi - traditional finance.
 
Account Model - a model used by ETH and a lot of other smart contract blockchains, where the global state is shared, and all operations are applied sequentially, one after the other based on tips, giving the rise of front-running, and other exploits or MEV.
 
Front-Running - refers to using the knowledge of submitted orders, to tip the exchange / protocol, with the aim to insert your order (based on existing information) ahead of other orders, in order to capitalise on this knowledge. For instance, spot a whale swap, tip the protocol to insert transactions before in the block, buy at the cheaper price, allow the whale order to move the market (whale pays more for the order), tip for 2nd order to be placed after the whale order, sell immediately for higher price.
 
EUTxO Model - accounting model used by Cardano where all assets are stored in EUTxOs (boxes) that can be spent either using private key (e.g. wallet transactions) and (Plutus) script (private key and script are locked on the box). The wallet balance is the sum of all EUTxOs that the wallet can spend. In the EUTxO model each EUTxO has to be spent when used, hence can be only used once per block (20s).
 
Concurrency ""Issue"" - a consequence of applying account based models to EUTxO model putting the entire pool liquidity into one EUTxO leading to either requiring an off-chain sequencer to build transaction blocks (but at the cost of centralisation) or to being able to perform only one transaction per block (as each EUTxO can be only spent once per block and to be used each EUTxO must be spent). ""Issue"" is quoted, since this is a design fallacy rather than the EUTxO model issue, which simply requires a different approach, and to architect concurrency into the protocol itself.
 
Arbitrage - exploiting the market inefficiency between trading venues (exchanges); in the most simple case of the arbitrage, let's say ADA is priced at $3 at exchange A and at $2.95 at exchange B. The arbitrage bot will find this information and will attempt to buy ADA at exchange B for $2.95 and sell it immediately at exchange A at $0.05 profit per ADA. The act of arbitraging moves the price, as after the execution, the price at the exchange B will be higher (e.g. $2.98) due to purchasing the discounted ADA, and on exchange A it will be cheaper due to selling it (e.g. $2.98). As long as there is a price difference between exchanges, so that when these trades are executed they are more profitable than the execution cost, arbitrage is possible. Arbitrage leads to all exchanges being arbitrage converging on the central limit value (true market sentiment from the aggregated exchanges) of the asset price. The arbitrageur earns profits by buying at discount from exchange B and selling at the premium at exchange A, hence both exchange B sellers and exchange A are the source of income for the arbitrage bot, and are ""victim"" of the market inefficiency (in reality they are not victims, but simply prone to be scalped this way). Finally, the mentioned example is the most basic case of arbitrage (pure arbitrage), there are multitude of arbitrage styles, including statistical, where arbitrage is based on the market movement predictions and the average expectation of reward https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage#Types . Arbitrage leads to efficient price discovery, but at the cost of market participants (both takers and makers).
 
Slippage - difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. In the AMM model, slippage occurs due to not large enough liquidity compared to the amount of assets being swapped.
 
Money≡ Energy - when modelling financial systems you can think of money as a unit of energy, same as in physics, we can think of kinetic, potential, and other energies, energy is potential to perform a certain amount of work. We can think of money in the same way, money has potential to be applied in the market from lending to businesses developing novel ideas, increasing market efficiency by providing liquidity to exchanges, creating information flow via arbitrage and financial analysis and research, to utilising available information to maximise returns given a specified risk appetite. However, energy can be applied in many ways, if we choose a very inefficient way to do something (e.g. growing tomatoes in a completely dark underground bunker we will expend a lot of energy) when we can put it in a greenhouse or even on a balcony and make much more energy efficient use. Same in the capital markets, efficient models lead to high money utility (energy well spent towards productive work), and productive work is the work that usually is associated with the rewards (e.g. business borrowing money will pay it with interest). Therefore, an efficiently allocated liquidity will work very well even with low total value locked and respond quickly to the changing market dynamics, bringing higher rewards per unit of capital.
 
Capital Efficiency - each task has many ways of being performed, one way will consume more resources (energy, time, etc.) than the other, hence the way which consumes less resources and achieves the same result is more efficient. The more efficient use of capital the better generated returns, the better user experience, and the better reflected the actual state of the market.
 
Efficient Market Hypothesis (Market Efficiency) - a hypothesis stating that the prices in the market reflect all the information available. In practice it is rarely true, a straightforward example is Dogecoin raise to top 10 and firmly remaining there based on a series of Tweet without without anything behind them, and even rebuttal from the Dogecoin development team itself, and market ignoring this information, and irrationally valuating Dogecoin at the higher price. This definitely does not reflect the fundamental information available in the market, and is an extreme case of market inefficiency. In traditional finance, such an overvalued company would be shorted and the research would be published showing its shortcomings, and people would evaluate validity of the study. If an asset would be severely undervalued, a leverage or long options would be bought magnifying significantly the potential returns from the efficient use of information. Under the Efficient Market Hypothesis, an asset would be priced at what they truly are worth and there would be very little difference in the asset prices between exchanges. However, to the contrary, market inefficiency is such a commonly occurring phenomenon that there is a whole field of study dedicated to measuring it and adjusting trading strategies based on it, but most of the time the inefficiencies take root from lack of information flow between exchanges (e.g. via arbitrage) and irrational decision making (modelled well by behavioural investing). But, this is not a problem without solution, it is merely the result of the environment emerging from inefficiencies of the exchanges and irrationality of the actors in the market.
 
Impermanent Loss - loss of capital when compared to HODLing due to inherent flaws of liquidity pool formula. The worst offenders are ironically the most popular family of constant-product pools such as Uniswap's v1/v2 x * y = const. It occurs when providing a pair of assets into a liquidity pool, as the rations of x and y change in the pool and the more the prices diverge, the bigger the impermanent loss. At some point, around the 20-50% threshold (the range is large due to inherent typical crypto volatility), actually holding the 2 separate assets outside of the pool would have been a better investment. It is even made worse by incentivisation by yield farming to create the most negatively correlated pools there are possible (completely deflationary crypto such as ADA and completely inflationary fiat such as USD). Those two assets will naturally diverge and create the impermanent loss, in a sense out of the gecko the deposited funds have a sizeable hole in the bucket through which the total value of the funds you deposited leaks. ... it is even made worse by many DEXes being either only concerned with increasing the amount of transactions (in order to obtain more fees from transactions) to being completely oblivious to this obvious mathematical fact (DEXes are generally built without regard to quantitative modelling). 
 
 
Problem & Solution
All established liquidity models, including those being currently developed by DEXes on Cardano, do not model markets well (see model, market efficiency, and impermanent loss in the glossary for more info) leading to low capital efficiency (expenditure of large amount of energy compared to the total value locked) and have inherent scaling limit due to global memory (akin to Ethereum accounting model) architecture.
 
What are the roots of the capital efficiency challenge?
 
1. Minting sound liquidity pools.
Challenge:
It is very important for the market maker to pick assets to put into a liquidity pool that, given the pool model, will minimise any potential losses while maximising the exposure to money marketing opportunities. Hence, one wants a pair that is frequently exchanged, but at the same one that is able to maintain its inherent value over time, a property that emerges from the specific assets in the pool and the model of liquidity that the pool uses.
 
In the majority of cases, simple CFMMs such as x * y = const and naive creation of negatively correlated pairs deteriorates the total pool value. The worst offenders are stablecoin in pair with cryptos. Stablecoins are by nature inflationary and crypto is in its nature deflationary. This means that the liquidity pool from day one is a bucket with a hole at the bottom through which your total rewards (rewards from providing liquidity and liquidity locked in the pool) deteriorate or in good case maintain current value (but then what is the point of providing liquidity).
 
The naive trend following on Cardano has now multitude of DEXes focusing on stablecoins and related liquidity pairs, while the only valuable role of stablecoin is to bridge traditional finance in which we live every day with the world of crypto. Once the bridge is crossed there is very little reason to do anything with the fiat, maybe perhaps except in rare conditions of very soundly designed stablecoins such as Djed which compensates swap of floatable for stable, but in the case of Djed it makes only sense to collateralise Djed with ADA, not to create liquidity pool of Djed fiat and crypto. 
 
Solution:
Provide observation and orientation using on-chain and external data, to provide telemetry when creating or seeding a pool that helps to visualise the capital efficiency and the risks involved (e.g. automatically alert if the pair reserves are negatively or weakly correlated). This way market makers will be able to make much more sound decisions. What is more, we plan to reward the most sounded liquidity nodes with platform tokens (to further incentivize sound decision making).
 
2. Capital efficient pool models.
Challenge:
Currently, the most predominant liquidity pool models such as CFMM and among them x * y = const are extremely capital inefficient.
In x * y = const and other CFMMs, liquidity is provided equally across the entire liquidity space defined by all (x, y) on the supply curve. This means that there's the same amount of energy reserved for the liquidity to be provided in the least likely scenario (e.g. ADA going to 0 and USD to infinity) as in the most likely scenario (i..e the current trading price). This is incredibly wasteful, and what is worse leads to an unnatural market model.
All prices, given the space is continuous enough, are naturally of geometric nature. Continuous means lack of sudden jumps from one price to another, in practice all markets are jumpy, but to be considered continuous under this definition the jumps have to be small relative to each other (an example of non-continuous markets are exotics such as NFTs).
What does it mean for the price to be geometric? It means that it follows the Wiener process (1-dimensional GBM - Generalised Brownian Motion):
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process ,
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion .
The reason for all prices to be geometric in nature is the relationship between ratios and logarithm, and ratios being how we express dynamic systems (in relation to itself).
Unfortunately, majority of market making formulas have a constant form such as x * y = const or similar, leading to incredible inefficiency in the pool price discovery process. Given, you can model any process iteratively with the worst model, given a step is small enough, it will eventually converge, but in practice it gives rise to such issues as
- slippage - the execution moving the price significantly leading in overpaying for the transaction;
- inertia - pool unable to update its price due to the astronomic size of total value locked having single trades with very little effect on the price expressed by the pool,
- unnecessary expenditure of energy - a lot of energy is wasted where it is not needed (impossible scenarios) and much longer process to converge on the actual price. Yes, arbitrage bots fulfil here a role of price balancer between exchanges, but there is significant lack of arbitrage between any different assets than BTC and ETH. People who exchange cryptocurrency constantly are for sure aware of sometimes gross discrepancies between prices for such liquid assets as for instance Cardano on different exchanges.
 
Solution:
Perform study of cryptocurrency asset types and families of quantitative models to express the automated liquidity. Provide a rich family of quantitative models for minting liquidity pools with information on what is the ideal pool in a given case and its parameterization. Allow for dynamic on-chain update of the liquidity pool parameters.
 
3. Liquidity fragmentation and concurrency.
Challenge:
The recent concurrency ""issue"" controversy only further proved that the majority of blockchain devs think of liquidity pools in very simplistic terms. It is easiest to design a pool with global memory, but then in the case of EUTxO account model it leads to 1 transaction per block (20s), or in case of optimisation running into memory issues (16kB per transaction and 65kB per block).
 
Solution:
All this issue, while actually EUTxO if utilised correctly leads to a series of very desirable naturally emerging properties. If one shifts from a monolithic blocks of liquidity to fragmented nodes reflecting separate market making decisions, that naturally leads to emergence of geometric pricing models.
Uniswap v3, by introduction of concentrated liquidity and indexes observed the same. People specify liquidity in the ranges they think are good market making ranges and provide liquidity only within this range. As result, from all concentrated liquidity a geometric pricing model emerges.
It is a natural consequence of aggregation of multiple samples each allowing for individual expression of market sentiment. It is due to CTL (Central Limit Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem ) which states that given a large enough set of random samples, a normal distribution naturally emerges.
Therefore, by fragmenting the liquidity into separate nodes all kinds of geometric distributions naturally emerge giving very efficient and market reflective pricing and liquidity models.
When combined with Maladex liquidity scripting language, it allows for expression of all kinds of market sentiments, and hence for an emergence of true market distribution. Maker orders in the liquidity pool express their belief of the market, and given a large enough sample it starts to naturally reflect the entire real market belief.
Hence, not only is there no concurrency issue, if we deal with this extremely complex routing and graph order formation, but it leads to some very desirable properties.
Concurrency still needs to be built into the system, but this is a routing algorithm for block EUTxO graphs.
 
4. Efficient price discovery via arbitrage.
Challenge:
Information about the makers and takers of asset prices is spread across multiple exchanges. This leads to such gross discrepancies as the 3rd largest crypto (by the market cap) having even sometimes 10-20 cents difference between exchanges. This gets only more extreme for smaller cap coins, as while Bitcoin, Ethereum, and to a lesser extent Cardano are actively arbitraged, the smaller caps are deemed not worthy of running arbitrage and hustle.
This creates a segmented markets between exchanges and lack of information flow. Arbitrage is a useful and necessary information exchange mechanism, and leads to efficient price discovery and convergence to the same price +/- delta delays on participating exchanges.
 
Solution:
On exchange A one asset might cost $3.00, while on exchange B $2.96. This obviously is a pure arbitrage opportunity - we can buy asset on the exchange B at the discounted price of $2.96 and sell it immediately on exchange A for the premium of $0.04 per unit (for the price $3.00 each).
After such arbitrage operation the assets on both exchanges A and B will now cost $2.98 and there won't be any more arbitrage opportunity, until the prices between exchanges diverge again.
This is not only lucrative to perform such arbitrage, but also leads to increased market efficiency - information from across all different exchanges is exchanged between exchanges leading to establishment of one geometric centric price (in the above example $2.98);
In the EUTxO and script validation mechanism model such arbitrage can be incorporated into a liquidity protocol, which we plan on doing. It will put market makers in the role of performing additional transactions (and earning additional fees), for takers it will provide market efficient price on Maladex reflecting the true market price at given time, and for the other applications it will provide invaluable on-chain price Oracle not approximating the true price, but having on-chain arbitrage proof of it. Such on-chain price Oracle does not have any lag meaning it is much more efficient than any other on-chain price Oracles (it is the optimal state), only subject to lack of liquidity not allowing for convergence of price in the market.
 
5. Expressiveness of liquidity protocol - Maladex scripting language.
Challenge:
All exchanges, even the most sophisticated centralised ones, offer a very limited number of order types.
For DEXes, usually only either CFMM AMM akin to x * y = const or limit orders.
CFMM AMM has disadvantage of all the introduced market inefficiencies, while limit orders on DEXes often leads to trading pairs without limit orders to execute against, or exploitation of the phenomena by creation of spoof orders (small order to execute at the good market price and significantly off one inserted upon the small order consumption to catch anyone executing using market price orders).
This limited number of ways to express makers' and takers' intentions and beliefs in the market leads to 2 things:
- a lot of manual work and monitoring to the market conditions, in case of some professional traders, even setting multiple alarms at night to check the market conditions;
- inability to express dynamic conditions such as, when the price starts to rise quickly, buy back, when the price starts dropping, quickly sell, create limit order, execute limit order not at once, but in a range over time, perform simple market order, provide liquidity of given parameterization, etc.
 
Solution:
Design Maladex own order scripting language allowing to express complex market sentiments and to allow for contract composition. This is akin to the idea described by Simon Peyton Jones et al. in https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/simon-peyton-jones/contracts.pdf . Using this scripting language, define the most commonly used order types (market, limit, liquidity pool, etc.), and allow for access to the scripting language.

We are engaged in the community promoting Cardano, answering questions (of all types, not only related to our project, including how to implement concurrency in EUTxO).
 
Funding
Total: $50,000
 
This project should receive significantly more founding due to its complexity and everything involved in delivering it, but we are conscious of other more popular projects applying in the same category (dcSpark, Minswap, and Indigo), and from experience in fund 5, we know that it is foremost popularity contest, hence we tapped down the amount to be able to receive the funding, if we made the list 4th (after those 3 projects).
This is a minimal funding possible to perform this work and we might need to apply in the future for additional funding (from audit to expanding any of the outlined concepts further).
 
Breakdown:
- 320 hours research and quantitative modelling of AAMM protocol, publication write up
- 320 engineering hours implementation and testing
- 80 engineering hours front-end design
 
Average price per hour $70 incl. VAT and tax.
Personal Funds Contribution
I have been building this project already since April 2021 and applied unsuccessfully for funding in fund 5: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/DEX-Cardano-Decentralized-Exchange/352819-48088 .
To be able to continue the work, I have put $50,000 of my own funds toward the project, of which only part has been spent thus far.
I have spent money for hiring graphic designer who created a lot of custom art for us, I have employed developers via Upwork, and paid for the infrastructure (over $2k per month) which hosts private Cardano testnet, current website, MAL stake pool, and much more, paid for marketing, and many single time expenses.
At the same time, I had multiple parties from VCs to private investors reach out asking to invest significant portion of the funds in the project. However, thus far we did not take any of those offers as one of the goals of our project is economic decentralisation (fair and wide distribution of the tokens in the community).
Thus far I have spent akin to $20-25k on the project development. To be clear, this is money I am never getting back as I do not receive any tokens, etc. allocation for it, we have got only fixed supply of tokens for the team (20%) which will be vested over the many years that project is being build. This means that I have got a lot of skin in the game, and the reasons I am working on this projects, which are the ideals I believe in.
 
Features
We have got a unique and refreshing approach to DeFi.
For full description check our site: https://maladex.com/#features .
But, to outline our approach in the case of AAMM protocol:
- capital efficiency - we make the best use of all funds locked, your funds are generating more revenue, and as the taker you find better prices.
- risk control - we build risk control mechanisms into the protocol.
- research and new frontiers - we push the frontier of the entire DeFi ecosystem forward, and we do it on Cardano.
- powerful tokenomics - we have got one token for all our projects, and check how much we work on at https://maladex.com/#roadmap , and we not only have fair launch, we plan on distributing the token to the wide community to engage everything in the protocol and its decentralisation via the shared ownership.
- one of a kind team - people with experience akin to our are not interested in DeFi because their day to day job pay exceedingly well and they are surrounded by some of the brightest minds in the industry, we however base our decisions on the goals of decentralisation and wide access to means of increasing financial wealth (hence financial revolution), we put our hearts into the project because we want DeFi as the concept to be successful and Cardano as a blockchain, and we build the future in which we want to live ourselves.
 
Definition of Success
1 month: collect on-chain telemetry, categorise financial assets, apply stochastic modelling, design fragmented liquidity model, write draft white paper
3 months: publish AAMM research paper, implement the protocol in Plutus and Haskell, testnet evaluation, stress and performance testing
6 months: launch AAMM swap protocol.
12 months: establish a new industry standard of market making proving the superiority of EUTxO model and pushing DeFi ecosystem and how we think about designing DeFi protocols to a next level.

Introduction
There's a growing number of Managing General Agents (MGA's) entering the market with new technologies and seeking alternatives to the traditional sources of insurance capacity. The Ensuro team developed a decentralized platform to collect and deploy insurance capital to meet that growing need for capacity.
Ensuro matches capital and insurance risk in a unique way. In providing capital, Ensuro aggregates incoming funds - in the form of stablecoins - from a constellation of institutional and retail liquidity providers (LPs). In assuming risk, Ensuro partners with MGAs and uses its reserves to support their products. By charging a commission, Ensuro secures revenues for its liquidity providers and itself. Consequently, Ensuro sits between liquidity providers (seeking higher investment returns) and MGAs (looking to access capital at affordable conditions) and is innovative for both.
As an investment solution, Ensuro is part of the growing Decentralized Finance movement. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols aim to provide traditional financial instruments without relying on centralized intermediaries, but rather using blockchain technology and smart contracts. DeFi is experiencing remarkable growth: having only appeared in 2019, its protocols currently handle more than US$ 80b and are adopted by more than 2.5 million users worldwide. Institutions are showing a growing interest in DeFi, allured by its success, efficiency, global reach, and decentralized structure. DeFi users can currently - among other possibilities - get loans, trade currencies, and speculate on price movements of a broad set of assets. While these options are very mature, the decentralization of the insurance sector is still in its infancy. Ensuro aims to be the first protocol to guarantee DeFi users the possibility of accessing insurance risk, providing them with an additional source of returns and a way to diversify their investment portfolios. 
The Opportunity
The new wave of MGA's disrupting the traditional insurance space requires not only insurance capacity but also a partner who understands the need for new technology to drive out the embedded inefficiencies which exist in current market practices. Ensuro addresses both of these requirements (1) by tapping into the huge volume of innovative capital, which is growing exponentially and flowing into Decentralized Finance (DeFi), to provide insurance capacity and (2) by using smart contracts on blockchain technology to introduce a new level of operational efficiency.
Competitors. Ensuro's competition can be divided into two main segments, traditional and non-traditional competitors.
Within the traditional ecosystem, the main competitors are insurers, reinsurers, and the Insurance-Linked Securities market.

Insurance and reinsurance are the natural competitors of Ensuro, providing underwriting capital to support both their own products and external MGAs. Having owned the majority of the insurance value chain with little/no competition, the legacy system had defined policies and processes standardization, solvency regulations, and economy of scale. However, the current set-up benefits established players to the disadvantage of policyholders, brokers, and those at the periphery of the insurance value chain. At the bottom of the insurance chain, insureds face inflated premiums to bear the costs of overheads, cost of capitals that ranges from 2% to 15%, and frictional compliance. Opacities and delays in claim assessments and payouts bring costs that take up about ~40 % of insurance revenues on average. Ensuro's model challenges incumbents by imposing itself as a cheaper alternative for MGAs and providing an appealing investment for liquidity providers. Through its smart contracts, Ensuro manages policies in a completely automated fashion, reducing overheads from 25% to 1% - 3%, whilst offering a reduced cost of capital as a result of supplementary returns coming from investments in the DeFi space.

 

Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS) are financial instruments whose values are driven by insurance loss events. As securities, some ILS can be and are traded among investors only on the secondary market. Insurance-Linked Securities allow insurance and reinsurance carriers to transfer risk to the capital markets and raise capital or capacity. Policies covered by ILS (usually cat bonds) must be fully collateralized, increasing their cost of capital. Annualized returns of Global Hedge Funds with investment strategies in Insurance-Linked Securities averages around 2% (reference Heurekahedge database). Through its smart contracts, Ensuro gives access to insurance risk at a level unmatched by the current ILS market, which remains out of reach for retail investors.
For the ILS investors, Ensuro offers a more dynamic and liquid solution for participating in insurance risk. Indeed, ILS suffers a trapped-capital problem: when an ILS contract is seen to be at risk of facing losses, the cedent can call for the collateral to be trapped or frozen, so it remains available while loss development continues. The collateral is trapped and unavailable for reinvesting, which can create a drag on ILS investment portfolios. The capital can remain trapped for months or years until the ultimate loss associated with the contract is clear and a payout is deemed due or otherwise. Ensuro mitigates this issue in two different ways. First, the functioning of the protocol is such that an investor can always liquidate its share of the collateral as long as another investor is willing to take her position; second, Ensuro will initially focus on parametric products with short tail liability, and its policies are handled automatically by smart contracts. For each policy, if the conditions for a payout are met, the smart contract reimburses the policyholder; otherwise, the policy's collateral is released immediately at the policy's expiration.
Finally, due to differences in solvency capital requirements, we expect Ensuro's pools to be a more profitable investment than ILS.

 
 Non-traditional competitors are insurance projects of the Decentralised Finance ecosystem. The main players are Nexus Mutual, Cover Protocol, and Etherisc.

Nexus Mutual is a crypto mutual fund focused on policies against smart contract failure and exchange hacks. Similarly, Cover Protocol is a peer-to-peer coverage market that allows DeFi users to be protected against smart contract risk. Both projects are non-licensed; hence they are currently covering a non-regulated segment of the insurance market. Nexus Mutual's current Total Value Locked (TVL) is 504.74M with 0.13% of supply locked in the protocol (up to date). Cover Protocol's current Total Value Locked (TVL) is 840K, dropping from 50M in December 2020 and 25M in February 2021, with 0.01% of supply locked in the protocol (up to date). Thanks to its license, Ensuro expects to operate as a regulated reinsurer and, differently from Nexus Mutual and Cover Protocol, will have access to a larger segment of the insurance market.

 

Etherisc is a decentralized insurance protocol to collectively build insurance products, which dates back to 2016 and pioneered research in blockchain based insurance. Etherisc is currently offering technical guarantees for payout instead of legal guarantees, fully relying on the immutability and transparency of smart contracts technology. Etherisc's legal structure defines Etherisc's contracts as simple service contracts instead of insurance contracts, effectively transforming the concept of premium into service fee and the concept of insurance into protection, with the consent of German regulator BaFin. Etherisc is currently operating in the Flight Delay insurance space, which represents the only licensed insurance product it offers, moreover, Etherisc is exploring Hurricane protection, Crypto Wallet insurance, Crypto-Backed Loans protection, Crop insurance and Social insurance, being at the stage of designing and prototyping such products. Etherisc's current market cap ranges around 30M, dropping from 70M in March 2021. Thanks to its license, Ensuro expects to operate as a regulated underwriter and, differently from Etherisc, will have access to a larger segment of the insurance market.

Protocol Description
The Ensuro protocol is comprised of three main components:

Liquidity pools: Ensuro creates dynamic pools governed by a smart contract on the blockchain (from now on, liquidity pools) where Liquidity Providers (LPs) can deposit money under the form of stable coins (e.g.,USDC), defining their acceptable cashback period, i.e., the amount of time they are willing to wait to receive their money3. The presence of well-defined cashback periods permits the protocol to plan ahead and compute the amount of capital available at any point in the future. With this forward-focused vision, Ensuro can always operate at the desired solvency level. Insurance is a profitable business. Being the heart and the fuel of the protocol, liquidity providers will share the profits from the pool, depending on the scale of their deposit and the duration of their cashback period.

 

Risk modules: Ensuro's partners will have access to the protocol's liquidity through our Risk Modules. Each risk module will be connected to a specific insurance product. To protect the Liquidity Providers, the Ensuro Risk Monitoring Module will perform proper back-testing of potential risk modules and Quality Assurance Tests (QA) on the outstanding ones to check that their performance is in line with expectations, and correct for possible deviations.

 

Asset manager: Ensuro's asset manager component will rule the interaction of Ensuro's reserves with other DeFi protocols. Specifically, the asset manager will deploy a part of or the total fund in other risk-free protocols (e.g., Aave) to provide additional returns to the liquidity providers. 

 
Benefits of Ensuro
Ensuro's model will bring several benefits to the entire insurance business chain. Through its smart contracts, Ensuro manages policies in a completely automated fashion. This feature helps to reduce overheads, benefiting the policyholders. Moreover, the automatic, transparent, and trust-less verification of a policy's trigger reduces the possibilities of fraud and eliminates any effort in the claiming process, ultimately benefiting both the policyholders and the partner MGAs. For MGAs, working with Ensuro has an additional benefit. Thanks to the openness and immutability of data stored in the blockchain, the performance of insurance products is recorded and available for audit, providing MGAs with solid proof of their models' validity and visibility to investors.
Ensuro will open the insurance risk market to retail and institutional investors. So far, access to this type of risk - suited to the creation of diversified investment portfolios - is denied to retail investors and still cumbersome for larger players. Due to differences in solvency capital requirements, we expect Ensuro's pools to be a more profitable investment than ILS, one of the few alternatives currently available to access insurance risk.
Finally, Ensuro will be able to provide capital to MGAs at convenient terms. Indeed, Ensuro's liquidity providers will experience supplementary returns on their investments thanks to the protocol's interaction with other players in the DeFi space such as Aave (https://aave.com) or Compound (https://compound.finance). These extra sources of revenues can help Ensuro to propose capital at a cost on the cheaper side of the spectrum while satisfying the LPs return expectations.

Deryck Lance has been a deeply engaged member of our community, entirely on a volunteer basis.  His expertise in the insurance field is not lost on us, though.  Let us make a community risk-management fund, accessible to the Cardano community for a small initial set of financial risk management contracts, leveraging Deryck's expertise in the insurance field.
Creating these initial smart contracts and application workflows in support of some of the most essential, lightweight use-cases for insurance and risk management, will create opportunities for liquidity providers to earn rewards for allocating a portion of their holdings to hold a portion of risk distributed across the purchasing pool. 
Making risk-management part of the Cardano portfolio of services will benefit the Cardano community by rounding out a brand that can play alongside traditional providers in this space, and meeting the market in geographic regions that other providers have not been able to serve.
 
Purchasers of these initial policies will guard against risk in ways similar to traditional insurance policies, but administering these policies using the shared resources of the distributed Cardano network will provide unique efficiencies, human workflow, and new opportunities to cover different kinds of risk scenarios than have been available in the past.  Policy fees will be contributed to the risk pool, and claims will be paid out of the risk pool after appropriate vetting and review through human process.
 
The distributed pool(s) of distributed risk will be an  source of revenue available to all holders of ADA, scaled according to the amount of funds they hold in the pool, and with the inherent statistical risks of payout balanced between many other providers in the risk-liquidity pool/fund.  The revenues returned will be the result of surplus built up on the balance of pay-ins and pay-outs on the fund.
 
I propose gathering a community-based effort to plan and deliver on this general vision, on a similar template with the rest of my proposals.  Perhaps it can be structures as an Insurance Cooperative.  Are you ready to  help bring decentral finance to Cardano?
 
Scope, budget and detailed project plans will be refined and determined through community-based process.  You can expect to self-organize with others in the community, serving various roles that may include the following and more.

A detailed plan will be shown on the presentation to be attached
 
Executive Summary
 
Africans do not understand investment types that are not based on familiar economic activities. Wise Rabbit addresses that problem by creating a livestock-based wallet which is a normal farming practice and already a very popular, low input, and quick return on investment.
Africa's farmers also suffer from a lack of liquidity and investment due to an unstable, inflationary currency which is resulting in poor food security and low growth opportunities.
 
Inflation in Zimbabwe, our pilot project country, is at 56% which erodes any bank savings by farmers and also causes high-interest rates from banks.
 
It's impossible to create a valuable community business in this environment unless the trend is arrested by a stable, accepted store of value. Livestock is something Africa understands well and is good at animal husbandry.
 
Creating a livestock smart contract will immediately solve the financing of farm activities while driving the adoption of the Cardano network as a reliable store of value. All grant funding will be used to create a form of ADA agri-coin to drive the food security value chain and ecosystem.
 
Wise Rabbit is a one farm, one manager, several decentralized members, crowd-farming model.
 
Our Solution
 

Create the digitally tokenized Wise Rabbit farm.
Employ one manager, one payroll for staff, and crowd-farm with the investment of 4000 ADA virtual farmers.
Capitalize the token from the natural evolution of the rabbit herd, with one rabbit parent capable of producing 48 new rabbits each year in a linear calculation.
Option to re-breed offspring for further growth of rabbit herd.
Wise Rabbit ADA wallets to become the token for investment and sale of rabbit meat for profit.

 
Qualifications
Sacha Robinson  (proposer)

Founded a crowd-farm investment concept in Zimbabwe, in 2020, which began life with 30 pigs and it has grown to 600 pigs with plans to scale up to 5400 pigs in the new year.
200 virtual farmers, from 7 different countries, subscribed to Dung Beetle Farms Trust and raised the seed capital to begin a piggery farm.
All investors have access to the farm for verification and observation of processes and receive weekly video and  WhatsApp updates and electronic statements for their monthly payments.
Wise Rabbit anticipates the same investors will be keen to take up an ADA wallet especially as some of them are based in the USA, UK, Canada, South Africa, Bermuda, Australia where BLC knowledge has taken root.
Current Dung Beetle Farms Trust staff under their manager's guidance are skilled in animal husbandry and will be further trained on rabbit production too.

Phase 3 ~ 8 weeks

Marketing / Virtual Agri-Business Network Events

Phase 4 ~ 1 week

Agri-Business Development Events
Retrospection and Reporting

 
Business Development Events will serve as a business networking opportunity for investors, entrepreneurs, and developers to come together to work on new agribusiness ventures. They will continue indefinitely, and be hosted every month once we have a sufficient blockchain virtual community.
 
Expected Launch Date

The launch of the Wise Rabbit is expected 9 weeks after funding date.(April 2022)

 
 
Community or Cause

Investment and Retirement Nest Eggs - investments in livestock through digital tokens at a level that almost anyone can afford thereby impacting thousands across Zimbabwe and Africa in the area of food security and healthy eating.
Regular Stable Income - Wise Rabbit will be backed by rabbit production and natural growth of the prolific rabbit breeding cycles which promotes a quick return than most investment types.
Savings Culture - at 5 Dollars per unit, a community whose savings have been eroded over 2 decades of inflation, can now become virtual farmers interested in a real asset.
Collaboration and Social Impact - Through crowd-farming on rented fields, an agricultural ecosystem of investors, farmers, and buyers will create a cohesive and supportive community.
Accessibility - everyone can become a livestock producer without leaving their home, making Wise Rabbit widely and conveniently accessible from any keyboard in the world
Financing - peer-to-peer local funding support coupled with global investors to provide much-needed funding that is only possible in the distributed farming approach.
Employment and Entrepreneurial - A farm-gate sale of meat at wholesale prices to those who wish to buy and sell rabbit meat from their own vendor stalls and at the meat market.

 
Challenges

Regulatory Environment - Current government stance on blockchain will be a potential threat
Tech-challenged farmers will potentially slow the adoption of digitalized assets until they understand it.
Decentralized operations of any business will always be viewed with initial suspicion.
Auditability will be met with friction by farm staff and management as we migrate to a blockchain.

 
Risks and Challenge Mitigation

The government will be engaged and shown advantages and alignment to their own goals towards increasing inflows of foreign direct investment. It should be an easy sell after the recently publicized framework for foreign-based investment.
Tech capabilities will be enhanced through training. Africa's majority is already smartphone savvy and usage in Zimbabwe is already at 96%. Re-training to blockchain and digital tokens will be expected to be easy.
Tokenization benefits are desirable and possibly the only viable option to change farmer's fortunes in a country where bank loans are non-existent. Decentralization will therefore be well received after training workshops.
Random audits will come to be accepted for their value and continued assurance of investors. Management and staff will therefore get used to the audits as well as their indispensable need. Training will be given to show the bigger picture and existing world examples of the benefits of a tokenized business.

A FREE USB STICK: An offline developer kit with selected Cardano resources aim at Internet-challenged regions for  new Cardano developers",1,"Saturday, 21 August 2021 11:54",judeebene,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/judeebene/3099870-48088,,,22500,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano offers a ton of online developer content and resources, but this is largely inaccessible to regions of the world with limited Internet access. Many developers in these regions can't gain easy access to the content they need, have trouble streaming tutorials, or just can't download a  binary Node, library or software developer kit (SDK).
We Propose a  Cardano offline developer kit  that offers selected developer's resources aimed at Internet-challenged regions.
The Content of the USB will include  relevant developers material to get any developer started in those region such as : 

The entire Plutus Pioneer Program Resources
Full Cardano course videos on  (Haskell , Plutus , SPO , marlowe  ,  etc)
The entire Developer Docs Website: https://docs.cardano.org/
Testnet Exercises like Alonzo purple Exercises. 
Stable Binary version of Cardano Node for different Operating System
Cardano videos from the Cardano Developers YouTube channel etc
other 

These kits  will be distributed through Cardano Developer Communities  and Events in Sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Bangladesh. 
 
How does this proposal fit into this challenge?
How many DeFi developers did this community focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?
 
How will  the Cardano Developers Communities use this?
The Cardano Offline developer kit can be used in an number of ways  to bring more DeFi Developers into Cardano for instance

Hackathons: Instead of having attendees try to download Binary Node or Building from the Source and other installation files with a poor or non existent internet connection, attendees can make use of the SDK installation files for Cardano that are available with the kit.
Viewing parties:  Cardano communities Event Organiser  can use the videos to hold viewing parties , where  members of such local Cardano community , office or school can come together to view and discussion videos on specific  Cardano technologies . example  hosting an SPO class  videos.
Reference and self study: Developers can use the the documentation , SDK and videos that come with the developer kit for reference and self study at home or in the office , example studying the entire Plutus pioneer Program offline.
Hosted within local intranet: Local Cardano Communities can copy the content (docs, videos, installation files ) to a local server in a local intranet in a local tech hub, incubator, computer science lab or office. That way members , staff or students can have access to the content within their local intranet instead of needing internet access to use it.

 
LICENSE
-  The Resources in this Kit will be distributed under the Creative commons and Apache licenses to help everyone  spread it as far and wide as they want!
 
Definition of Success


Number of Free USB distributed  per week


        Number of updated resources added in each quarter.


Number of Cardona  event participant Receiving the Kit.


Success stories of what DeFi Project they are building with it 


Numbers of new Learners  Receiving the Kit in those Regions.


 
Risk/ Challenges
We have identify two  challenges in the implementation of this project.
1.   There is a risk of people selling the USB drive to Developers in remote region without our knowledge and this can lessen the real impact we  set to achieve.
2 There is also the challenge of finding ALL the weekly Cardano's Communities Event happening in the target region.
 
To solve the challenges, we will

  We will label All the branded Cardano USB drive with ""NOT FOR SALE"" boldly 
 we will collaborate with various Cardano Events  Listing platform and Community Organisers.
We will reach out to IOG technical committee for a newsletter mention
 We will design an On-demand  Request Form for Cardano Developers Community to request for the Kit.
We will make use of Premium delivery for Fast and On time Shipment.

 
IMPACT
As new developers and  team are building  DeFI projects in Cardano, one of the thing we can do as a community for developers in internet-challenged region is to help them SAVE COST during the learning phase of their Journey.
Poor internet network coverage for online courses can hinders so many developers in those region  and we know that talents are everywhere but opportunities and resources  are not.
Given them the resources to learn in offline mode would SPARK many ideas and local solutions for their region while others would have the technical Skill to be employ by company and startups using Cardano Blockchain.
Overall would increase the adoption and building DeFi projects in those Regions.

Who is Volibra?
Volibra is a small team of developers building merchant payment Infrastructure on Blockchain. The first product we plan to build on the Cardano blockchain is P2P Trading Protocol for the African Market. This P2P protocol is the first step of bringing our Merchant payment API from Diem blockchain to Cardano and a key to unlocking millions of Africans with cash and limited Strict access to banking services to adopt Cardano. (https://volibra.com/)
Our team consists of several Plutus developers, a front-end developer, and Infrastructure/DevOps Engineer. With these resources we believe we can develop a Workable MVP that can be used by hundreds, if not thousands, of Users. Our team is also part of the Alonzo-purple testing cohort and plutus pioneer Program.

Who we are?
We are Kashin; we are an up and running social credit reputation app for underbanked micro-entrepreneurs in Latin America, we give immediate loans between $12.50 and $125.
Our social algorithm sets credit scores so that users increase their credit line and reduce interest rates according to their own credit behavior and their first-degree referrals.
In 5 months operating we have these results:
- USD 25,000+ lent in 1,200+ loans from 1 to 4 weeks periods
- Average interest rate of 15%* and default rate below 10% (The system has 15% default and other micro-lending startups have defaults between 20% to 40%)
- +87 NPS points (Range: -100 to +100)
- Churn below 20% & ascending volume lent COHORT
We are one of the 20 finalists from the 500 Startups Acceleration Program sponsored by the Peruvian Government in July 2021.
Our team:
Jose Manuel, our CTO, was Tech and Data Regional Lead for Cabify - the largest Uber regional competitor.
Jose Francisco, our COO, was Project Manager at Cabify and a former E&Y Consultant.
I am the CEO, before I was the Regional Manager of Cabify, before I was a Consultant at McKinsey, & Credit Analyst at HSBC
We have as mentors: The Chief Transformation Officer of Rappi, the CEO of EmCasa, the Chief Growth Officer of MuniTienda.
 
Why do we do this pilot?
Controlling default rates in microlending with small interest rates is very hard, but we are being very successful in that aspect with our disrupting social algorithm, we are the pioneers scaling social credits with technology*. But securing debt funds to escalate our loans to more people and geographies is our next challenge. We are Cardano advocates for a while ago and MELD inspired us to leverage stake pools engagement for a higher purpose while making a good investment for ADA holders.
With this pilot, we want to test our hypothesis that we can engage ADA holders to stake with us and achieve the goal of limitless funding for our micro-credits because without the collaboration of the ecosystem this wouldn't be feasible.
 
Deliverables:
1. To validate the engagement of the Cardano community with our project, we will create and evaluate the performance of two stake pools:
- One stake pool with 100% rewards support
- One stake pool with 50% rewards support
Deadline: 1 month from funding.
 
2. To be ready to distribute our reward tokens once we officially launch, we will define the legal framework for the retribution of our tokens to our stake pool supporters.
Deadline: 3 months from funding.
 
Challenge success & KPIs:
If our pilot succeeds, we will move forward switching our company funding strategy to Cardano so we will be one more Fintech using Cardano's DeFi ecosystem. Our pilot will be successful if:
After 1 month:
- We have the 2 stake pools up and running
After 3 months:
- We have more than 500 ADA holders staking in our stake pools
- We have more than 1M ADA staked in our stake pools
 
Budget:
- 100 hours of Senior Dev: $3,000
- Legal assessment fees: $3,000
- 2 Raspberry pi: $380
- 2 Solid state drives: $120
 
Partnerships:
- MELD has successfully launched the first ISPO (Initial Stake Pool Offering), with over 270M ADA staked in their stake pools. We are on track to a long-term partnership for them to provide us liquidity from 2022 onwards.
- Vent is supporting us in the legal & tokenomics for our launch to market. We aim to give a clear utility purpose and create value for our token holders with the progress of our ecosystem.
 
Find attached our draft for the token business model to understand the value creation flow.
 
*Our protocol is set at 5% profit, and we are working on automatizing interest rates for all our different user clusters.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Pay for development of a framework that can be rebranded by anyone wishing to be a Site Owner.
These are turnkey profit machines based on fan appreciation of NFT artists or families of NFT within a genre. The framework is a website that manages a few interactions with the Cardano Blockchain to maintain a membership community from sale to merchandise.
Like Fantasy Football, Fantasy Bidding allows fans of a particular NFT to gather socially around it, in a setting where they can add to the overall purchase 'purse'. NFT fans also need a place to congregate around their favorites directly.
My premise is a stakepool for every NFT that fans would 'like' to own but cannot afford to win at auction. By contributing to a stakepool 'for' a particular NFT, any number of individuals can 'contribute' to a winning bid. Until the sale is achieved, the staked ADA continue to gain rewards for the 'bidders'.
At some point in the future, there may be an auction that the entire amount in the pool will be enough to win, or the owner of the target NFT is eventually impressed with the amount, and executes a sale.
The transfer of token ownership goes to the Site Owner's wallet and it is held 'for' the group of collected bidders. They will be proportionally paid at the time of ""total sale"" when the NFT token is transferred to another entity.
Until there is a ""total sale"" (100% consensus) the actual NFT token remains in the Site Owner's wallet, and members can exchange ownership at a 1:1 ADA ratio.
From the original purchase, to the eventual sale, ownership is constantly in flux, and Fan bids are always active. 
While in the Site Owner's wallet, ALL fractional owners have equal individual rights to use, but not licensing. Proceeds from any licensing contract are the property of the NFT and pay out to all current owners only. When ownership changes out of The Site, terms of use are up to the owner.
The Site does not deal in exchanging ADA for any other currency, but performing wallet functions for users interested in a 
""single home experience"" is of interest.
Profit comes from overall stakepool rewards, and small % fee on sales.

https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Plutus-PAB-Typescript-SDK/368540-48088
#What is Indigo?
Indigo allows the creation of fungible assets, ""synthetics"", that track the price of real world assets (Stocks, ETFs, commodities). Indigo synthetics are intended to be used as money legos in Cardano DeFi protocols, and to unlock liquidity across the world's assets, all on-chain.
#What is a synthetic asset?
A synthetic asset is simply a tokenized derivative that mirrors the price of an underlying asset. Imagine that you want to trade BTC shares without holding the BTC asset itself. Using a synthetic, you can trade iBTC (Indigo Synthetic BTC) instead, which fluctuates in price identical to the underlying asset by tracking and continuously updating its price feed using data oracles.
#Relevant Experience
Indigo Labs is a software development company. We are a team of developers and consultants with Plutus and DeFi domain expertise. Our devs have completed the Plutus pioneers program, are in the top 20% of Plutus contributors on GitHub and are active members of the Catalyst community. Our consultants bring a balance of fintech, DeFi and product development understanding to the Indigo protocol and we are using this experience to build a composable DeFi protocol 'money lego' for the entire Cardano ecosystem. To get in touch with our team or learn more about us, please visit https://indigoprotocol.io/.
Kikai Tech is a software engineering research & development team specializing in functional programming, Blockchain and AI. Kikai's list of partners include Cardano DeFi lending protocol MELD as well as AI focused firms Vizgard and Nobi. 
 
#Deliverables
-Deploy the Indigo v1 contracts to the Alonzo testnet when full smart contract functionality is made available.
-Deliver the Indigo v1 contracts and SDK at the time as Goguen mainnet. The v1 will include full protocol functionality and enable users to mint iAssets that track the price of real world assets using Plutus smart contracts and oracle price feeds.
-The final report of the Plutus smart contract security audit will be made publicly available.
-Weekly development progress reports will be submitted to the Cardano ecosystem (this has already begun).
Our definition of success is accomplishing each of the deliverables highlighted above on time and on budget.

Main Deliverable:
Pilot: A 6-week training program focused on:
- The basics of DeFi
- The Cardano DeFi Landscape
- Current Projects and Success Stories
- How to find a team for your DeFi idea
- How to get your DeFi project funded with Catalyst
--------------- IMPACT -----------
How does this proposal fit into this challenge?
Helping DeFi teams scale over the next 6 months must include an element of education and collaboration.
How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?
By providing a platform for Devs and Entrepreneurs who are both inside and outside of the Cardano ecosystem to learn how DeFi can be applied and scaled. This means more talent is brought in, more projects are created and more innovation takes place, where teams are sharing knowledge, collaborating and receiving expert advice.
Outlook and future challenges?
The end-game for this proposal is a learning and collaboration portal solely focused on the DeFi ecosystem within Cardano. This will be done, first, with a pilot program of 25 applicants, then with a larger pilot, and finally with a new cohort every 3 months who would follow a well-defined, but ever-evolving curriculum for 'DeFi for Cardano'. 
This will be split into a 3-phase proposal process to gauge the community's ongoing support for this initiative and to ensure fiscal sustainability.
------------ FEASIBILITY------------
Reference (Past Successes):
WADA is already building a learning management system (LMS) as well as a membership platform, where new DeFi teams can be onboarded, trained and access the network resources, including developers, designers and software architects.
Currently, there are Haskell and Plutus curriculums under development at WADA as well as a proposal for multilingual support, catering to those in French and Arabic-speaking countries. There is also a Catalyst Virtual Startup Bootcamp that will run in conjunction with this program and aim to support it through access to team members, proposal editing and business advice.
Roadmap:
After successful funding:
First 60 Days:

Build the curriculum, with videos, documents and presentations
Confirm educators and speakers, review the material they will present
Engage WADA technical and design team to build out the platform, upload content and create graphics and illustrations
Launch a 15-day marketing campaign targeted at DeFi teams and individuals both inside and outside of Cardano
Open application process for 20 days

Next 30 Days:

Review applications and conduct interviews where relevant for 16 days
Announce successful applicants 14 days before launch
Pre-reading documentation handed out for blockchain fundamentals

Launch Program (Feb 15th):

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


www.DragonDefender.com developed over the past 10 months and has been undergoing lots of testing with real YouTubers, and is now what we would call at MVP (minimum viable product) level. https://www.dragondefender.com
The system is comprised of multiple backend nodes that are centrally controlled by a cloud service and presented to the users with a web frontend.
The independently running nodes scan an on-boarded white list of YouTube channels and using a comment matching algorithm (that has been fine-tuned over 10 months) detects and removes 95% of spam messages and 99% of YouTube channel imposter's messages.
The cat and mouse fight never stops
Dragon Defender is Google YouTube Compliant
Google has been auditing our website and our tools to ensure we are using their Google YouTube API responsibly and have rewarded us with the Seal of Approval that means we can use their API with confidence.
We will continue to be audited and work with Google and together we will offer to our customers the fastest and most reliable service we can.
Dragon Defender History
DragonDefender.com was built from seeing a video from Charles Hoskinson back in 2020 stating how much spam and imposters comments he was receiving on his YouTube channel.
Now nearly a year on we have been building and testing the alpha then beta version and now monitor a selected number of Cardano based YouTube channels every 30 seconds and have deleted over 500,000 spam messages.
The biggest YouTube channel we look after has over 550k subscribers and has Cardano videos 3 or 4 times a week, we also look after other Cardano based channels that are growing at a fast pace such as:
""Kaizen Crypto"" (22k subscribers) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyf3zGnYK9jcF_mlRc_ztEA
""Cardano With Paul"" (53k subscribers) https://www.youtube.com/c/CardanoWithPaul
Project Catalyst History
I am proud to have been selected as part of the Founder 50 members in Fund 1 and my team and I have delivered the Fund 3 project https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Smart-Contract-Plugin/333827-48088 and are currently working on the Fund 4 project https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Code-Market-Plugin/341436-48088
Roadmap
Please see our website for the latest roadmap
https://www.dragondefender.com/roadmap.php
Costs
Costs will follow.
We have self-funded this project for almost a year and although we will continue to fund dragondefender.com to have real impact the infrastructure needs investment. We can only scale about 30 YouTubers with the current model.
The current design allows for an unlimited amount of nodes so scalability has been built in however we need to incentivize people to run a node. We therefore want to build a Host-To-Earn model where we can reward node hosts to help the system grow.
Another major milestone is to move away from the central cloud hosting to be completely decentralized. We know how to do this but need funds to build and test.
It is natural to offer multiple services to our customers and we have started to build and would like to continue building a similar tool for Twitter.
What is success?
Success will be for the system to be able to expand and help 100's of YouTube channels and other social media platforms to fight the Spammers and Imposters.
The ultimate goal is to keep the service free to all Cardano Community members that promote the blockchain on the many different social media platforms.
IP
Unfortunately the IP cannot be shared, if the spammer and imposters knew our secrets the service would not work. We are keen to make some elements open source and work with others to help build the tools, and we are exploring ways this can be achieved.
What will the funds be used for?
Some of the funds will be used to scale the project and pay for additional hardware resources and the remaining will go towards adding an additional member to our team that will help to develop the software further. The funds will only last 3 months at which point we will continue to fund the ""Free to Cardano Influencers"" project ourselves, but the funding will be vital in allowing the project to get off the ground successfully.

Build network of experts around the world to identify and respond to emerging regulatory threats to cryptocurrencies",11,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 09:49",Maury Shenk,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Maury-Shenk/3095338-48088,,,9000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


There are a wide variety of existing and potential regulatory threats to the future development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects more generally. These include, among others:

taxation
securities regulation
anti-money laundering (AML) requirements
transaction and customer reporting (which relate to AML) -- e.g. recent cryptocurrency customer reporting proposal in US infrastructure legislation (see https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/02/how-language-in-the-infrastructure-bill-could-roil-the-crypto-markets.html))
direct regulation of crypto-related activities -- e.g. China restrictions on mining
law enforcement requirements -- e.g. retention of data for law enforcement investigations (similar requirements have long applied to communications companies).

For example, at the Project Catalyst town hall on 11 August, Charles Hoskinson described the major risk to cryptocurrency business models from the proposed US reporting legislation linked above, and the major engagement by the cryptocurrency community to convince US Congress to modify the legislation. 
Over time, regulation of cryptocurrencies will increase, as has happened over the last 20 years for Internet technologies generally. Rules will differ between countries, creating complexity for global operations. And eventually regulation will likely spread from cryptocurrencies to blockchain more generally.
It would be valuable for the Cardano community to build a worldwide network of experts who could identify such regulatory threats at an early stage and consider possible responses to them. The goal of this proposal is to start this effort by identifying appropriate experts in major jurisdictions and building a structure for them to cooperate (e.g. within the framework of Catalyst). Such a structure should ideally be community-driven, and limit reliance on expensive lawyers and consultants who tend to be the most visible experts on such regulation.
Outreach to potential participants in this effort would use a combination of existing Project Catalyst communications channels (e.g. Telegram, Discord, after Town Hall, etc) to involve the Cardano/Catalyst community, with outreach to a global network via email and other means. 
Deliverables and Definition of Success
Deliverables would be: 

Identification of members of the Cardano community in key jurisdictions around the world (e.g. US, EU, China, Japan, Switzerland, etc) who could act as sensors and report on regulatory developments
Proposed structure for future organization of this effort, including how issues would be passed on to IOHK/IOG, Cardano Foundation and others
Proposed approach to incentivizing participation in #2, using ADA or otherwise.

Success in this project could be defined as:

3 months: completed initial outreach to Cardano community to identify candidates for deliverable #1, and substantial progress in interviewing candidates; initial drafts of proposals for deliverables #2 and #3
6 months: completed deliverables
12 months: operational regulatory sensing network based upon the output of this proposal (would require further budget to move from completed deliverables above to an operational network).

Experience
I have 30 years of background in technology regulation and policy (as a lawyer, investor and director), and good contacts on technology regulation around the world. Further information on my background is at https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauryshenk/. Because I have many other commitments, a key goal of this project would be to find a broader team that can take it forward operationally. I have started discussions with Project Catalyst community members regarding such cooperation during the process of refinement of this proposal.
Budget
The proposed budget of USD 9000 (USD 1500 / month) is intended to be modest compensation for the time required on this effort over the first six months. My aim is to recruit one or more Catalyst community members to share the effort of the project, and to share the compensation.

SUMMARY FOR COMMUNITY ADVISORS:
The DLT-360 RISK RADAR Idea: We are proposing the development of a MVP of a powerful, (later-on quarterly recurring) risk-assessment and reporting-service to the CARDANO Community. The outlined assessment and reporting-service goes far beyond core-technology risks and CyberSecurity. Step-by-step we want to address all the 'complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components' by implementing a professional risk assessment process following the ISO 31000 industry-standard. We consider this to be a key-element in further growing CARDANO's unique reliability reputation.

impact / Return of Intention: By creating a simple but effective mechanism for identifying complex CARDANO-related risks and opportunities, we are directly addressing this challenge setting. In addition, we combine the mere risk assessment with a smart way of visualizing (Risk Radar). Furthermore we want to utilize the reputation of senior experts from industry, economy and society at the reporting frontline. This way we can deliver important improvement impulses to the CARDANO community and send strong trust-building signals to commercial users and the general public (find more details below).
Feasibility and likelihood to succeed: The core-proposer, Heinz Gassner, has more than 30 years of experience in leadership positions within industry (see LinkedIn Link above). This background provides access to a strong network of highly capable experts in many areas of technology, economy and innovation. For delivering this proposal, a diverse team of inter-disciplinary contributors from industry-, university, regulatory partners and specific subject-matter-experts will be established. Our determination is to provide this later-on as a recurring service in close collaboration with CARDANO Foundation, IOHK, existing quality- and CyberSecurity-partners and other key-entities of the CARDANO Community (find more details below).
Auditability: Fund 6 is intended to fund the development of our Service-MVP, including the delivery of 2 live examples of a quarterly reporting to the community. We have defined tangible milestones along this Fund 6 journey. For transparency reasons we are establishing, maintaining and visualizing our Business Model Canvas, Activity Backlog and Kanban-Boards in MIRO. The successful deliveries according to our Fund 6 goals will be crucial to convince the CARDANO Community to install our DLT-360 RISK RADAR as a quarterly recurring service format later-on (find more details below).

 
THE DETAILS
Vision and Strategy
Today's Fortune 500 companies are all operating professional risk-assessment and risk-management systems. This can be easily expanded with scouting for improvement opportunities. By establishing a multidimensional risk-assessment and improvement-radar, we want to contribute to CARDANO's unique reliability reputation - very valuable for attracting high-potential industrial, commercial and public users. The outlined risk assessment of the CARDANO DLT-360 Radar goes far beyond core-technology risks and CyberSecurity. Step-by-step we plan to address all the 'complex amalgam of technological, economic and social components'.
The Radar-Screen-Reporting-View allows for easy visualization of the different risk & opportunity segments, showing estimated time and size of potential impacts. This radar-format has been successfully applied since many years, e.g. by major insurance companies and also within the work of the World Economic Forum (WEF). Besides capturing, analyzing and visualizing, we aim for establishing a large sensory-network as well as a core-team of senior experts for running periodic (quarterly) reporting sessions.
 
Underlaying Business (Service) Model Canvas
The first drafts of the underlaying business model canvas has been started in MIRO, fine-tuning will be ongoing throughout the duration of Fund 6.
Market & Customer-Segments
Whenever major players in e.g. industry, finance, education, healthcare or government are utilizing a public blockchain, trust in the technology as well as in the accompanying governance and risk-, lifecycle- and innovation management is key. With the services of CARDANO DLT-360 RISK Radar we are addressing and supporting

Risk- and innovation-management teams within the CARDANO Community
Risk-management teams of professional users of the public CARDANO Blockchain and tech-stack
Expectations and demands of regulatory bodies
The marketing and reputation-management teams of the CARDANO Community

Value Proposition
We see the following value propositions

Easy, drill-down capable overview of major risks and opportunities, from the big-picture into a more detailed perspective
Well structured capturing and reporting perspectives from different viewpoints (market, regulations, technology, security, usability, scalability, reputation etc.)
Legal and reputation-benefits by demonstrating best-effort, applying a state-of-the-art risk assessment and risk-management framework according to ISO 31000
Adding value to various periodic CARDANO communication formats

Revenue Stream
While Fund 6 is intended to cover the initial development of our Service-MVP and the delivery of 2 quarterly reports/reporting sessions, the future of our service will largely depend on which direction the CARDANO Community wants this to go after Fund 6:
A) Exclusive quarterly service inside the CARDANO community: Can be based on a quarterly fee
B) Alternative: open service format, additional subscription-based revenue from a modular service-portfolio to a wider community of customers: This could lower the quarterly fee, but might lead to loosing focus on Cardano.
Channels
Our value proposition will be communicated and delivered exclusively over our dedicated tools, our WEBsite and over virtual online channels (recorded or live online meetings). Participation in physical summits and meeting formats must be examined case-by-case.
Customer Relationship
This service requires a certain degree of independence, but must nevertheless be closely linked to the CARDANO Community and/or CARDANO Foundation. Depending on which of the 2 options outlined under 'Revenue Stream' is implemented, there is also the potential to establish business-intelligence and consulting-oriented relationships to clients outside the direct CARDANO community later-on (not part of this MVP-oriented Fund 6 proposal)
Key-Activities & Roadmap
Our current assumptions within Fund 6 are based on delivering a MVP-version of the services to the CARDANO Community. This includes:

Formation of a frontend core-team of high-reputation experts
Formation of the required backend team
Development of basic strategies, structures and processes
Implementation of ISO 31000 compliant risk management framework 
Establishing the basic tool environment (surveys, databases, presentation layer)
Defining the structure of major assessment segments
Backend work for capturing, analyzing and aggregating inputs
Establishing our WEBsite
Designing our reporting format
Delivering 2 live examples of a quarterly report to the community
Summary and terms & conditions for making this to a ongoing quarterly format

Key-Ressources & Partners
The proposer, Heinz Gassner, has more than 30 years of experience in leadership positions within industry (https://linkedin.com/in/heinz-gassner-9540a241). This background provides access to a strong network of highly capable experts in many areas of technology, economy and innovation-oriented institutions. For delivering this proposal, a diverse team of inter-disciplinary contributors will be required:
Backend resources & partners

Selected industry-, university and regulatory partners
Specific subject-matter-experts
CARDANO community to contribute to surveys and specific alerting

Front end resources and partners

A core-team of 3 to 5 high-reputation persons to represent and present

Cost Structure
The current cost-estimate is based on the activity-list shown above. The calculated costs will arise along developing this MVP service format. Other costs are not listed and will be seen as initial investment from side of the proposer and from other key-contributors (more detailed cost breakdown will follow).

Team formation: Costs difficult to estimate, covered by proposer
Development of strategies, structures, ISO 31000 framework and core-processes: USD 10.000
UX design and setup of reporting tools, live presentation format and WEB-Site: USD 10.000
Initial content research, analysis and aggregation: USD 10.000
Delivery of draft- and MVP version of the reporting service: Costs difficult to estimate, covered by proposer
Summary and terms & conditions for making this to a ongoing quarterly format: covered by proposer

 
Public Launch Date:

We propose that this project will use Gimbalabs Project-Based Learning process and community-based planning - see this other proposal to understand why and how we will involve the community in every step of delivering on this proposal, on the same general plan:
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/NFTs-derisk-Project-Capitalization/368330-48088
 
We propose to develop a decentralized protocol through which the Cardano technical community can blacklist or whitelist smart contract code hashes and code.  An API will then be exposed for wallet backends and DAO constructs to gain guidance for end-users about the likely level of trust people can or should have in any given set of smart contracts, including flags for malicious or known insecure contracts.
 
Together with the community mechanisms found in Catalyst Swarm and Gimbalabs Playground we will explore practicalities and risks in this field, develop recommendations, and iterate protocol details so that people using supported wallets can get some signal about known scam warnings and other negative-reputation information.

Addressing the Challenge
The Challenge team's key metrics are right on point for our project.  With regard to smart-contract scam reporting, we can report on all of these metrics

Number of potential threats that have been submitted
Grading of the submitted threats by urgency
Number of threats that have been identified as serious and systemic
Grouping of threat sources into categories and types to determine wider danger areas
Number of Cardano stakeholders interacting with the threat alert mechanism

With regard to the last item on this list, we anticipate every wallet transaction interacting with a smart-contract would leverage the smart-contract blacklist mechanism.
 
 
How can we help stakeholders identify serious emerging systemic threats for the Cardano blockchain before a threat overcomes the system? ->  By providing infrastructure to enable Cardano to be a consumer-ready blockchain.
 
Charles Hoskinson spoke on this topic, coincidentally, just the next day after we originally wrote this proposal. Check out this timestamped link in his video:

 
Technical Goals and Deliverables Overview
There are many elements that are possible to include in such a code execution reputation system, and we are keen to get into the range of possibilities available. We will hold a summit for developers of wallet and DAO developers to gain insights into a better trust model and user-friendly API services.  Stakepool Operators (SPOs) will be engaged in the development of decentralized deployment strategies.  It is critical that we find a set of trust interpretations and flagging algorithms that limit false positives (false scam reports) and maximize community utility, transparency, deployability.
 After our research, we will capture and present our findings to the community and conduct two community sessions to explore the problem space further, identifying next opportunities for important additions to the protocol and establish a roadmap for further recommendations.
The whitelist/blacklist trust data structure will be available via read-only IPFS access for community metering of threat velocity, bad-actor identification.
 
Milestones
3 Months:

Build a knowledge base for contract transparency, trust models, integration specifics

 

Follows from two events:

 

Smart Contract Developer Ecosystem & Trust Summit (identify how we flag, how we search the blockchain, how do applications digest flagged contract data/interrupt contract transactions)

 

SPO & Decentralized Service Deployment Summit (Who will host this service?  Do we allow for paid channels/services?  What does that look like?)

 
6 Months:

Example faucet with contract hash search and whitelist/blacklist registry
Example wallet integration via API calls
Sample ""honey-pot"" contracts on blacklist, demonstrating the blacklist in action
Hopefully, a low number of scam contracts : )

 
12 Months:

Beta wallet integration with Cardano light/web wallet (e.g. Gamechanger wallet)
Continued small number of bad contracts
User metric: ""Cardano is a consumer-ready blockchain I can trust.""

 
Budget
$1500 x 2: Summit Setup, Registration, Followup and Documentation
$10000: Architect smart contract blockchain search service and IPFS whitelist/blacklist storage
$5000: Build API access to search service results (whitelist/blacklist)
Total: $18000
 
Join us in creating this piece of critical infrastructure to guard the Cardano community.  You know where to find us!  Catalyst Swarm and Gimbalabs, of course!
...compared to other proposals...
Some other proposals in this category seek to report on Youtube and other scams outside our ecosystem.  That's a good thing to do, but we sought to create more direct impact on a larger number of Cardano users.
Gimbalabs is also proposing for a truth-in-labeling initiative, linked below. There are a number of differences between these two proposals, noteably that the contract-blacklist functionality is, first and foremost, a way for the community to respond to emerging threats.  These threats can come from any contract, including those having true and complete labeling.  Meanwhile, contract labeling is expected to be a primarily author-initiated mechanism.  Hence, two proposals for two separate scopes.

Summary
Kafka ecosystem provides the components to correlate massive volumes of data in real-time to provide situational awareness across the Cardano ecosystem to find all needles in the haystack. We can deliver contextually rich data to reduce false positives:
1. Collect all events from data sources with Kafka Connect
2. Filter event streams with Kafka Connect's Single Message Transforms (SMT) so that only relevant data gets into the Kafka topic
3. Empower real-time streaming applications with Kafka Streams or ksqlDB to correlate events across various source interfaces
4. Forward priority events to other systems such as the SIEM/SOAR with Kafka Connect or any other Kafka client (Java, C, C++, .NET, Go, JavaScript, HTTP via REST Proxy, etc.)
These can be further split up into the following categories:
Data Producers: comes from various sources which include real-time syslogs, batch systems, network logs / pcap logs
Data Normalization and Enrichment: data correlation in real-time at scale. This includes data normalization and processing such as filter, aggregate, transform etc. Data governance concepts for enforcing data structures and ensuring data quality are crucial on the client-side and server-side
Data Consumers: workloads require data correlation in real-time to detect anomalies or even prevent threats as soon as possible. Kafka Streams or ksqlDB provide out-of-the-box stream processing capabilities.

Overview
Understanding the risk posture for organizations, systems and applications is critical in developing mitigation strategies, managing the risk tolerance, and communicating security plans.
Beyond the message of how to remediate a risk finding, it is also important to easily and properly score and report through a framework that is consistent and well known to the community at large.
We propose a Risk Profile for Cardano stakepool operators who manage individual nodes across the network. The risk profile would be a streamlined process with several stages. The audit will build upon standards developed by the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and the International Standards Organization (ISO). We will work closely with the SPOCRA community of stakepool operators to identify the key security vulnerabilities, complete audits of a wide group of stakepool operators, and to disseminate the proposed surveys.
The first stage which is the focus of this proposal will address the inherent risk profile. This will be an easy-to-follow psychometric evaluation of the key areas of risk defined by the model. It is a self-assessment that provides an initial risk profile based on the stakeholder's own responses to allow the framework to easily score and point out weak areas of risk and concern within the system.
A companion proposal, Cardano Risk Control System, submitted to the F6 Disaster: When all is a Stake challenge is a six-month project focused on the second phase of validation of the self-audits. A third phase, focused on modeling risk management scenarios, will be proposed during Fund 7.
Proposed Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
Building and developing the approach for a Risk Profile will require the implementation of an application that will easily integrate into a great community of risk, for which the risk profile can be one of the variables in contributing to the overall risk catalog for the stakeholders's unit under management.
To accomplish this we propose the following objectives and key results:
1. Integrate Cardano Stakepools onto the NOXMON C2RM (Control Cyber Risk Management) tool
    a. 5 major and 10 minor security indicators have been identified for stakepool operation
    b. 2 stakepool operators have validated the operation of the website integration
2. Develop templates for independent Stakepool node assessment
    a. 10 assessment questions have been composed and validated for the survey
    b. 10 stakepool operators have been identified to participate in the initial survey
3. Reporting engine for stakepool operators to publish current findings on the Stakepool Node assessments
    a. 2 stakepool operators have contributed to the development of the reporting engine
    b. 5 stakepool operators have published survey results with the SPOCRA community

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Motivation
Tens of new Cardano scams are launched each day. Whether through hacked YouTube channels, social media, or direct messages, scammers lure new Cardano users to their scam sites, promising giveaways and lotteries. As a result, naive Cardano users end up losing millions of dollars and, could very well, stop their cryptocurrency journey out of fear of future loses. Charles Hoskinson has released at least two episodes on YouTube warning users about scams, further exemplifying how urgent this emerging threat is. While education is a core component of protecting users, it cannot be the only component. We need technical means to protect users in their very first steps of their Cardano journey.
 
Our proposal
Motivated by the magnitude of this giveaway abuse, we already built a Proof of Concept (PoC) of our proposed system for early detection and reporting of Cardano phishing/giveaway scams. The backend of this system is currently running on a personal server operated by the PI and the front-end is a dedicated Twitter account: https://twitter.com/CardanoPhishing
The bot currently works by parsing large lists of DNS zone files searching for domain names that include certain configurable keywords like ""hoskinson"", ""cardano"", and ""ada"". For each such domain, a web crawler is automatically dispatched that scrapes the page, looking for phrases associated with scams (e.g. ""giveaway"", ""hurry up"", ""event"", ""send X ada""). The scrapes that result in a large number of matched keywords are then marked as potential scams and are reviewed through a special dashboard that we have created. Each true scam is marked as such and then automatically tweeted.
 
In less than a month, our bot has tweeted more than 300 discovered scams (we discover between 5-10 new domain names each day). The reception has been remarkable. Namecheap (a popular registrar and hosting provider) has been consistently taking down the reported scams hosted on their servers and we have gained almost 200 followers from nothing more than word of mouth. We have de-risked this project via this PoC since we know that our approach works.
 
We wish to continue working on this project (transforming it from a hobby project to a real system with real value), hence this proposal. Our proposed areas of work (visible in our attached image) are as follows:
- Expand sources of suspicious domain names, past zone files, including the use of Certificate Transparency Logs and YouTube. We'll need to build continuous integration pipelines to fetch daily lists of domain names, build YouTube bots capable of screen scraping and OCR-ing videos (in search of domains embedded in scam videos), and then dispatching armies of crawlers towards the identified destinations.
- Work on anti-evasion mechanisms before they become an issue. We anticipate that scammers operating these scams will have every reason to evade our proposed bots (detect that we are visiting them and show us benign content). Our anti-evasion mechanisms will revolve around geographical diversity (so that a single IP address cannot be blocked), diversity of crawling software, and other anti-fingerprinting techniques that we will incorporate into our tools. The PI (Nick Nikiforakis) is an academic with 15 years of cybersecurity experience and has built a large number of bots for discovering online malicious content ranging from phishing pages to technical support scams.
- Isolate intelligence content. Other than just reporting the discovered malicious websites, we will work on isolating parts of them, such as, the advertised wallet addresses. We will make lists of malicious wallet addresses available to wallet software and online exchanges so that new users can be warned when they are about to send money to them, and given a chance to read more about giveaway scams. Similarly, we will create lists of malicious IP addresses and domain names that will be available to hosting providers, ISPs, registrars, and operators of blocklists such as OpenPhish, Phishtank, and Google Safe Browsing.
- New dedicated UI and APIs. Next to our Twitter account, we will develop a modern web application where users will be able to retrieve lists of malicious URLs, IP addresses, and wallets. The site will also be the API endpoint for all the aforementioned intelligence that will be provided to interested stake holders. Co-PI Peter Bui is an experienced web developer and has connections with multiple wallet providers that we will use to advertise these APIs.
- Popularization of our tool. The Co-PI of this proposal (Peter Bui) is an operator of a popular Australian Cardano Stake pool and the podcaster behind the ""Leard Cardano"" podcast (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj-_2e7L2UgHaJLrGEOJRzA). We will use this podcast to not only keep warning new Cardano users (the ones who are the most likely to be attracted to a podcast about learning Cardano) about these scams but also use the reach of this podcast to connect with stakeholders in ISPs, hosting companies, registries, and web-security companies, who can all integrate with our APIs and protect their users.
- Manual analysis and ML. A stretch goal for this project is the use of supervised machine learning for the final labeling of suspicious web pages. Once our database of known scams sufficiently expands (past say a thousand positive, i.e., scam, samples), we will experiment with supervised machine-learning techniques (such as a Random Forest) to automatically flag the high-confidence scams so that manual analysts can focus their labeling efforts on only a number fraction of suspicious domain names for which the classifier cannot produce a high-confidence label. We have experience using supervised ML for detection of phishing pages, malware sandboxes, and tech-support scams.
 
Cost
We request $10K for this project. According to our current projections, these funds will be split 70% towards the development of this system (as described earlier) and 30% towards infrastructure and service costs (such as the cost of virtual machines, larger quotes in geolocation/ASN APIs, and possibly OCR services for scraping suspicious YouTube videos).
 
Roadmap
As mentioned earlier, a PoC of our system is currently up and running, reporting scams on a daily basis.
Month 1. We will port our crawling infrastructure to multiple dedicated cloud servers that exhibit geographic diversity.
Month 2. First iteration of our separate web frontend showing our so far collected scams
Month 3. Finish incorporating multiple anti-evasion techniques, additional sources of scam domains, and a working copy of our YouTube scraping bots.
Month 4. Finalized YouTube scrapers. Design of APIs endpoints for malicious wallet addresses, IP addresses, and hostnames.
Month 5. Further work on finalizing endpoints. Reaching out to stakeholders. Keep advertising this project over the podcast, and keep educating users.
Month 6. Bug fixing, exploring our stretch goal of using ML for some/most of the labeling effort.
Month 6+. Integration with stake holders. Analysis of possible evasions and mitigations for them. Further education via the podcast and social-media accounts.
 
What is success?
Success will be for our bot to keep finding new scams each and every day (i.e. successfully bypass future evasions by scammers) and for at least one stake holder (ISP, hosting company, exchange, wallet provider) to express interest in integrating with our tool. We will also use our social-media presence to collect evidence of takedowns (e.g. such as Namecheap's existing tweets in response to our reports) and stories of users who did not fall victim to such scams, because our tool protected them.
 
IP
Given the very real threat of evasions (i.e. scammers studying our tool and identifying ways of bypassing it so that they can avoid being flagged) we cannot open source the code in the traditional sense of the word. Our code, however, will be freely available to vetted researchers and the Cardano foundation.

Let's seed monetized e-learning platforms with popularizers that can teach Cardano with a gamified wallet and keep earning organic income",8,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:47",Adriano Fiorenza,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Adriano-Fiorenza/3099741-48088,,,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Counting with such a little budget in multilingual resources challenge we need to think about efficiency and sustainability of the requested funds. 
 
Economical incentives surrounded by knowledge, tooling and community support not to newcomers directly, but to those influencers that can deliver multilingual content in their own countries can help to reach a continuos stream of diverse public into the Cardano space, even more if this newcomers are future builders and Catalyst proposers.
 
Incentivized Platform Seeding (IPS): The idea is to economically incentivize popularizers, teachers, influencers to not only publish learning tutorials on their own languages on free to access social and media platforms but also to ask them to do it on monetized e-learning platforms to help them start micro-business models for them that make their seeding efforts sustainable on time and encourage them to keep doing it once we run out of budget to finance their efforts.
 
Current Cardano community hubs on the web will serve as recruitment, planning and also on facilitating open meetups to capture new multilingual public and help them grow their user base as well. Newcomers will be derivated to Catalyst and crowdfunding hubs to start thinking on their next steps towards building on Cardano. 
 
Also the idea is to focus on basic Cardano wallet usage tutorials but mostly on simple dApp integrations to seed future builders and posible Catalyst proposers from other countries into Cardano. Nowdays there is a wallet that is commited to facilitate dApp integrations through simple URL connectors that can be used not only on websites and apps, but also on email, social and messaging platforms, and this can be built by no-developers because they are almost no-code based, users can generate them using a very simple JSON script called GameChanger Script. Here is a simple ""minter tweet"" to try this out:
https://twitter.com/GameChangerOk/status/1433861451618426880?s=20
GameChanger Wallet is a highly humanized and gamified wallet commited 100% to lower the entry barrier for students, entrepreneurs, junior developers and people in general around the world.It's primary goal is to allow people focus on what really matters rather than loose attention on device requirements, non intuitive user interfaces, and high level coding skills requirements.
 
GameChanger Wallet is going to be improved over time to allow internationalization but in the while as many pioneers around the world do their first steps on english written products first, we propose to start that way as well to make a first iteration of this onboarding project. 
 
Funds to popularizers are going to be delivered upon results like posts on platforms, tutorials delivered, meeting attended, etc..
 
Funds for Internationalization first steps, smart contract support and infrastructure scaling is being asked on this other proposal:

https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/GameChanger-The-onboarding-wallet/367709-48088

Budget breakdown:

Most of the funds are for popularizers to cover content in 15  number of different languages (it can vary), delivered after requirements are fullfilled [$1000 x 15 ] $15000
Support and community hubs expenses $3200
Contingency for scaling wallet infrastructure if the other proposal does not prosper. (Dandelion APIs colaboration) [$300 x 6 months] $1800 . In case of not needing this, we can grow the number of popularizers with it.

Auditability:

Social and e-learning platform metrics
Wallet geographical and usage metrics
success stories from users and popularizers
Community hubs feedback and attendants metrics

 
How success looks like since funding event?

Day zero BC (Before Catalyst): Wallet is online already, and it is being improved everyday. The recruitment for popularizers will begin. In-deep coordination talks with Cardano community hubs will start. 
After 3 months: Popularizers will be recruited. Talks, documentation, code examples and tutorial will be shared. They  will be already making and publishing their content. Payments will be delivered upon publishing objectives. 
After 6 months AC (After Catalyst): Content will be already online, bringing new students, developers and even entrepreneurs from different countries and languages to Cardano. Community hubs will recieve them and point them to Catalyst to power their projects and for growing voting participation. 
After 12 months: Popularizers will be earning income and became incentivized to keep doing it. More builders from different languages will join. The wheel will be rolling by itself.

Everstake is ready to create many educational materials about Cardano and distribute them among our customer base. Our experience (30+ blockchains) shows that the most efficient way to reach out to the maximum audience - is to create useful educational materials, spread organically via social media and messengers.
In addition to simple educational materials, we are planning to focus on more serious guides for developers, which will help to increase their interested in Cardano and to build Dapps on top of Cardano.
Everstake has successful experience with creating such step-by-step guides in several forms:
1. Blog articles (medium), Everstake blog, guest blogs

Distributing materials is the same way important as creating, what's why we use several channels:
Social media: Twitter (Everstakes', Wallets', partners'), LinkedIn, Facebook, Quora
As for example posted by Everstake or Everstake team
Retweeted by wallets and other platforms

Virus marketing (soon ppl, will try to help each others answering ""how to stake"" by providing such links)
https://prnt.sc/v3tdy6
https://prnt.sc/v3tgy6
Targeted Ads (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram) / Paid publications
In addition to distributing material in our media, we also use paid advertising and narrowly targeted advertising on social media. This allows us to attract new users or take their attention from other blockchains
https://twitter.com/bo_opryshko/status/1318493649672507393
https://twitter.com/bo_opryshko/status/1314166180802957313
https://altcoinlog.com/staking-platforma-everstake/
We use Social Sprout to track customer engagement and are able to provide reports.
P.S. Depending on the increase in profits from the validation, Everstake plans to use a significant part of the funds for community development, both general and local. This will help us expand the influence not only of us as a validator but of the Cardano blockchain as a whole.
Criteria 1: [KPI and Deliverables]
Create text guides for existing wallets on 3 languages
Create video tutorials
Add Cardano into Everstakes' staking assistant platform
Criteria 2: [KPI and Deliverables]

Criteria 3: [Reach and potential users]
1. Articles / Blog posts / Guides
For example, a couple of articles can bring in a week: Views: 500 - 1000
In a month: Views: 2000 - 5000
2. Video
For example, a couple of videos can bring in a week: Video Views: 500 - 1000
In a month: Video Views: 2000 - 5000
3. Twitter Promo
For example, 3-5 posts can bring in a week:
Engagement Rate (per Impression): 10% Impressions: 10000 Engagements: 1000
In a month: Engagement Rate (per Impression): 7-10% Impressions: 30000 - 50000 Engagements: 5000
A more accurate prediction for the next months or year can be made after the first month of content creation. As all our activities will attract a new audience to the Near ecosystem, we forecast a weekly increase in subscribers to social networks and blockchain users (creation of new accounts) in 200 - 500 users, respectively 800 - 2500 per month.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


PURPOSE
The purpose of the platform would be to connect two parties. The Cardano ecosystem and people who do not speak English. Our starting target pool would be various communities based in rural parts of Ethiopia. We would first work to onboard those who are bilingual to enable them to act as a bridge between 
Translators should be paid for the time and work involved in translating. There would be a rating system and senior translators with experience and a history of high-quality ratings would be certified by the community, similar to how StackExchange works. In the long run, we would work to build more formal certification standards. This is crucial for Cardano to succeed in many markets where English is not a primary language. This project would be started with Endubis in Ethiopia and with the help of the Cardano community, it has global potential. 
HOW?
Translators can get trained and certified remotely so long as they speak a minimum of two languages. The platform will be open for anyone to join and contribute to documents requested by the community.
We aim to establish a stake pool that can subsidize the cost of using our platform and make it more accessible & affordable. The community would be able to request a translation by staking to the Translator Stakepool. Once funds have been staked, they can request translations into any languages supported on the platform. Each project would be visible to the language community, who can add their votes on top of any projects that they wish to see translated. Voting would work similarly to Project Catalyst where members would either vote for or against any document. The platform would connect as many working translators to projects as possible.
WHY?
This would be hugely beneficial to Cardano communities in Africa, India, and many other parts of the world where language diversity is high and many people are not native English speakers. Putting the information in more people's hands and empowering them to work on building within their own communities improves the lives of many and grows the potential of the network massively and empowers local solutions to local problems. This would not simply apply to educational material about blockchain which we would provide but all sorts of translation requests can potentially be fulfilled with this model.
BUDGET 
2 x Fullstack Devs - $3000/month each (18000)
General Manager - $3000/month (9000)
Technical Writer - $3000/month (9000)
2 x Linguistics professionals - $ 3000/month each (18000)
Marketing (6 months) 1000/month ($6000)
Stakepool Hardware $300
Testing and Organizing DAO would require Community members to join the project community and take part in the final stages of the project. Members will be asked to stake to a new stake pool and will be rewarded for taking part.
 
Definition of success
Translators get better pay and experience from using the DAO model than traditional middlemen
Create massive and distributed employment opportunities all over the world
Adoption for people who don't need to understand what blockchain is but just need simple ways to use their skills to make money.
By end of 2022, we would have a Minimum Viable Product that can be built upon and updated
The expected start date would be February/March 2022. The time before then would be spent assembling a team to build this project.
This project is going to take far longer than 3 months and more planning and refinement will be required before implementation. The proposal is being archived for further revision. If you are reading this, feel free to reach out if you would like to communicate with me about this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Before going to the implementation plan, we would like to present some reasons for our establishment of designing ""Catalyst course in Vietnamese""
5.1. The importance of the Catalyst Project in the development of the Cardano ecosystem
At the end of September 2021 it is expected that we will activate Smart Contract. That will be the time to mark the landing of a series of projects running on the Cardano platform, contributing to the expansion of the ecosystem in the future.
And the Catalyst Project is a very important part of the expansion of that ecosystem.
But, the results of the Cardano Vietnam community survey show: about 89% don't know Catalyst, or don't care about Catalyst... The numbers showed the problem.
Through the investigation, we once again found that the language barrier has restricted the Vietnamese community from accessing Catalyst in particular and the Cardano ecosystem in general.
That's why we wanted to Design an online course about Catalyst in Vietnamese.
5.2. Implement Plan:
5.2.1. Month #1
- Building White Paper (status, problems, goals, causes, solutions...)
- Develop a specific work implementation plan based on 5W2H.
- Build infrastructure: domain, host server, design website on wordpress, design intro/outtro for Youtube channel... hire experts for post-processing.
- Organize and synthesize advanced and official information sources about Catalyst.
- Develop specific lesson plans of the course.
5.2.2. Month #2
- Share some information about the basic components in the Cardano ecosystem (Partners, research units, ADA-listed exchanges, wallets...)
- Translate, edit, and update all advanced Catalyst content from the official Catalyst information source available in Month#1 and share it publicly for the community to refer
- Advertise about online sharing course with Cardano Vietnam community.
5.2.3. Month #3
Organize Basic Course on ""Catalyst Project"" in Vietnamese.
The Basic Course includes the basic contents of Catalyst (the lesson plan will be updated and added before October 7, 2021).
5.2.4. Month #4
Organize Advanced Course on ""Catalyst Project"" in Vietnamese.
Advanced Course includes advanced, in-depth content about Catalyst (the lesson plan will be updated and added before October 7, 2021).
5.2.5. Month #5,6
Community Survey about Catalyst Course -->Get Feedback --> Review --> Improvement according to PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) -->Community Report.
5.3. Metrics to measure:
- Basic Course: 4 lessons, Livestream 1time/1week in 4 weeks.
- Advanced Course: 4 lessons, Livestream 1time/1week in 4 weeks.
- Website: 3 post/1week in average, at least 1000 access times every week.

Translate content for non-English speaking SPO communities for communication flow between communities ensuring voices are heard & channeled.",19,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 07:11",Ron Hill,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Ron-Hill/3056814-48088,ankachain.vr,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/ankachain-vr/3055570-48088,11340,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The plan is to use funds to pay translators to create content in various dominant languages of the non-English speaking SPO communities. The content will include transcriptions of guides, updates, and other educational content as well dubbing SPOCRA videos.
SPOCRA will expand the reach into more geographic areas to support more SPOs by receiving feedback via a bi-lingual interpreter from non-English speaking SPO communities. Sub-networks within the overall SPOCRA network can be formed over time to ensure pertinent information is shared, voting on important decisions can be held across all communities, and the voices of SPOs regardless of what native language is spoken can be represented by SPOCRA.
The SPOCRA mighty network will become a multilingual platform allowing non-English speakers to gather and information be shared more readily over an expanded geographic range. Ultimately, the SPO community will be much stronger by forming a wider collective of shared knowledge/ perspectives, skills, and community engagement.
Definition of Success:
After 3 months 
Hiring of dedicated individuals in the Cardano community from various non-English speaking communities that can translate content to their native language. Success would be achieved in the form of some guides and videos fully translated and made available to the community. 
After 6 months 
Completion of more translated content in additional languages and bridging of communities to share knowledge, perspectives, and issues among the SPO communities. 
After 12 months
We are aiming to make SPOCRA content accessible to and cross-communication between Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Hindi, Russian, Vietnamese, Hebrew (Israeli), and more non-English speaking SPO communities.
Sub-networks within main SPOCRA network to increase cross communication flow and ensure voices are channeled through SPROCA to official entities such as IOG and the Cardano Foundation.
Budget:
Budget is based on average of about $0.18 per word translated including transcription, dubbing, etc. depending on language and content being translated (written or voice) ranging from $0.09 – 0.32 per word.
The main stake pool guide is over 4000 words and guides in development will be similar amount. The official SPOCRA video has over 700 words.
The first goal would be translating guide/ course content ~7,000 words to at least 9 major languages as a start.
7000 words X $0.18 X 9 = $11,340
Auditability:
The written guides will be available on the SPOCRA mighty network site in the guides section of each of the various sub-networks for each of the geographic communities represented. The videos will be posted on our official public YouTube channel.

The Catalyst School is a place to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles.
We help onboarding and help improving the skills of:

Proposers
Community Advisors
Veteran Community Advisors
General new Catalyst members

Our main proposal in Fund 5, with more details about the scope and goals of the Catalyst School, can be found here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School/367842-48088
Current Problems and Limitations
Working closely with the Eastern TownHall, the Catalyst-school realized the high potential of the eastern community. This allows us to educate english speaking attendees while also identifying local bilingual teachers wanting to work together with the Catalyst-School and training them so they can give classes to their peers in their communities.
Proposed Solution: hold classes in the Eastern Hemisphere TownHall
With 7 natively spoken languages the Catalyst-School decided to help educate non english speakers in [1on1 sessions](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School-Multilanguage/368887-48088) but we don't want to stop there. Working closely with the Eastern TownHall, the Catalyst-school realized the high potential of the eastern community. This allows us to educate english speaking attendees while also identifying local bilingual teachers wanting to work together with the Catalyst-School and training them so they can educate and eventually give classes to their peers in their languages with their cultural needs in mind.
What we have done already
We held 2 introductory classes in the ETH already, introducing attendees to proposing in Catalyst as well as Community Advising.
What we are going to do
We are going to help the Eastern Town Hall set up their own School with the actions as follows:

holding further english sessions for bilingual Eastern community members
Identifying future teachers and training them in 1on1 and group-sessions
help them write a joined Fund 7 proposal for teaching in their language to their community

The Team
This proposal is being submitted as a partnership between Eastern Hemisphere Townhall and The Catalyst School.

Eastern TownHall: Cardano Community skilled practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in Vietnam, Indonesia, Japan and Korea. Mission: Connecting West African Developers and Entrepreneurs to the Cardano Ecosystem and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).

Don't miss the project extended content here!: https://lydian-yumberry-ebb.notion.site/Babelada-Project-e50398826bcd4efc91265be683729d9e
 
Huge market
According to a quick survey applied to a small sample of the community members, their native languages are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesian, Arabic, Vietnamese and Bahasa Melayu, among these, only the 33.3 are English Speakers.
Babelada is for the whole community
Babelada is a platform that will allow the community to collaborate, through gamified features, as a translator of the most relevant Cardano/blockchain resources from English to any other language.
One of the perks of the platform is that it promotes the participation of any bilingual/multilingual member of the community, allowing to reach big amounts of translated materials, to diverse languages. Also, the quality validation of translation would be in charge of the community.
The platform considers 3 different kinds of users:
English material owner: The user that produces and owns the material; they decide how to divide it and post it and the desired languages to be translated to, according to their particular requirements. Once they receive a satisfactorily translated material, they award ADA rewards to the translator user.
Bilingual/Multilingual Translator: This user selects the available materials to be translated, based on their specific languages knowledge. Once they translate satisfactorily, they receive ADA rewards, these rewards can grow the more the users participate as translators and according to their evaluations received by the Learner user.
Learner: The user that consumes and evaluates the quality of translations.
How is gamification suitable
Babelada will possess an algorithm to calculate rewards according to translator collaboration history and their evaluations, as well as material length and language required. Material owners will transfer ADA as a reward, and Translators will receive their rewards securely and transparently. This feature will be developed using Cardano Wallet Backend API
Through this, we will incentivize collaboration of any community member, so we can increase the amount of translated resources.
How to stay and grow
After delivering Babelada MVP, next iterations will consider new features to attract new members of the community to collaborate in delivering materials, translations and evaluations.
How are we using the funds
Analyzing and tracing the features needed for the MVP and its development and launching plan, community participating as product owners are highly encouraged to collaborate with us at this stage of the project | $2,795 | Month 1
Designing the user interface to warrant that 3 user roles have an adequate experience | $3,796 | Months 1-2
Generating processes and systems workflows, as well as user cases for every feature | $3,224 | Months 1-2
Executing Back-end design | $3,419 | Months 2-3
Implementing and maintaining required infrastructure for development, pre-production (6 months) and operation of the MVP platform during 6 months | $6,760 | Months 2-12
Developing, functional testing and deploying | $37,276 | Months 3-6
Creating a base rewards fund to award Translator user testers for translating testing material | $2,500 | Months 5-6
Documenting | $2,730 | Months 3-6
Digital Marketing | $1,000 | Months 6-12
General roadmap
IDEAS | Month 1
DESIGN | Months 1-3
PRODUCTION | Months 3-6
TESTING | Months 5-6
LAUNCH | Month 7
MARKETING | Months 6-12
OPERATIONS | Months 7-12
KPIs
At least 150 documents posted in Babelada for translation during 6 months of operation
Documents translated to at least 8 different languages during 6 months of operation
At least 10 English material owners users joined the platform during 6 months of operation
At least 500 Translator users joined the platform during 6 months of operation
At least 500 Learner users joined the platform during 6 months of operation
The platform will be built using open source tools and the code will be shared through Github, able to be distributed or modified, always recognizing the authors.
To fulfill the KPIs, Babelada requires to be launched after 6 months of development and testing, and also to operate during 6 months, as an MVP. After this round, the project would be able to have features updated and to extend their operations period to enhance the goals of the KPIs and to add new KPIs to evaluate quality and learning impact.

Build a web portal in Bahasa Indonesia with simple language, easy to understand content and supported by the Indonesian Cardano Community",31,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 04:59",Dion,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Dion/3085614-48088,,,2535,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


What We Want to Do
We want to build a one stop Cardano Community portal for Indonesian in local language with Simplicity in mind ; simple words, easy to understand and navigate (especially by young generation), and driven by the Community
Why?
With the raising demand of information and all things Cardano (including the Crypto space) in Indonesia, we noticed that;

No trusted Indonesian Language web/portal for everything about Cardano -->The community are finding hard to get even basic information regarding Cardano vision and mission that are valid information and non biased other than ""price-action"" web or other general ""crypto-web"" in local language. NOTE:  We also observe scammers are getting worse in the past few months going into Alonzo mainnet in Sep 2021. 
Indonesia low proficiency on English --> Please see attached for further research from EF
Scattered Community Managed by SPOs --> We also notice that the Indonesian SPO operators are starting to overwhelmed managing the information, updates, and guide the community through their web, telegram channel, etc.

With Indonesia entering its demographic bonus peak (2021-2030) we believe a trusted and well managed one stop hub (portal) in Bahasa that can reach younger generation are urgently needed.
 
What Success Looks Like
Active community contribution to support the content of the portal, a minimum ofweekly content all things about Cardano in Bahasa.
Regular community virtual meetup, expected to raise in registration and attendance. Will start on bi-weekly basis timed just after the mid-month and cardano360
Became the hub ""all things Cardano"" for Indonesian 
 
KPI
[Month 1] Design & Build the Portal - working with SPO for feedbacks
[Month 2] Web portal live
Once live, the web/portal should aim to be in the page 1 of google search ""Cardano Indonesia""

Onboarded minimum of 70% the SPO telegram members listed on the Indonesian SPO Alliance (https://adafolio.com/portfolio/706e40cc-84a7-11eb-a0f8-0242ac120002)

Cardanesia - ADI (currently 733 member)
Kawan (currently 2300 member)
Icryp (44 member)
York (44 member)
GIRLS & CUAN are currently not active at the time of writing

Budget
Total $2,535

Web Design & Web Developer $735 (including hosting and early implementation)
Web Admin - 3month $750; to maintain the portal on early stages
Marketing & Rewards $900 ; a $10/day for 90days marketing campaign for contributor rewards
Zoom pro $150 ; to host virtual online meeting (pro) up to 100 participants/event (upgradable)

The Team
A team of two, and more!

Dion - Myself, currently still working for Project Logistics company as Business Development, a blockchain and crypto enthusiast, with entrepreneur mindset. I will take the role as the Project Leader aka ""The MAGICIAN""
Toma - A great artist, illustrator, and web designer - he also can create some music jingle and cool animation! he will take care the role of Lead Designer aka ""The LOVERS""
The community - from SPO operators, delegators and even anyone can contribute (and receive reward from the community for their contribution - on Phase2)

----
This proposal is for the PHASE 1 ONLY of envisioned sCommunity Hub (Self-Sustained Community Hub in Indonesia)

Phase 1 : Web Portal for Indonesian in Bahasa Indonesia (Local Native Languange) - FUND6

This phase will built the web/portal and live within 3 months (Q4-2021) focusing on concept design & basic functionality.

According to World Almanac and Book of Facts, around 44 million people speak Polish as a native tongue. 2017 research showed that as much as 10% of Polish citizens knew the term ""Bitcoin"" and ""cryptocurrencies"", and since then the global market has risen substantially. Poland also ranks in the top 10 countries hosting the most cryptocurrency ATMs. Yet Cardano stays under the radar. There are only around 3000 members in Cardano-related Polish social media pages and Polish posts on forum.cardano.org cannot get more than a couple hundred hits. What's our idea on how to change that?
We want to build a complete Poland Cardano Center. A place where people with different levels of knowledge meet and find valuable sources of information. Where everyone can learn new things: may it be 'what wallet do I need for Cardano assets', 'what is proof-of-stake' or rather 'how to build your own smart contract on Cardano', in general learn about possibilities Cardano is offering. Where people can freely share their ideas, thoughts and concerns.
Our kind of online hub will consist of:
1. Webpage with articles covering current Cardano-related news, basic blockchain educational pieces, descriptions and researches of projects based on Cardano, onchain data based on 'Cardano Blockchain Insights' and probably more,
2. Cardano & blockchain related podcasts published also on existing YouTube channel
3. Telegram group (already existing with ~800 members: https://t.me/cardanopolskaADA
4. Twitter (already existing with ~300 followers https://twitter.com/CardanoPolska))
5. Mailing list with weekly/bi-weekly updates
6. Discord channel
 
Budget:
1. Server + domain (1y) ~$200
2. Suitable theme with customized graphics (logo, buttons etc.) ~$250 (could be done as a community contest to find secret ""gems"" - freelancers)
3. Articles:
- translations $0.02 per word, average length of article 1000 words = $20; 3 articles a week ~ $60; per month ~$240; per 6 months ~$1440 (+ free 'guest articles' by Cardano Ambassador, news pieces thanks to cooperation with local crypto news outlet)
- original pieces $0.03 per word, occasionally, ~4 per month ~$120, per 6 months $720
4. Podcasts: 1 professional podcast per 2 weeks, with guests (experts, community members, developers), published on already known YouTube channel + Spotify + Apple, Google Podcasts and more, sometimes with rewards for listeners: ~$200; 2 per month, around 10 per 6 months ~$2000
5. Cardano merchandise (like stickers, pens, T-shirts) to incentivise our community moderators tirelessly working pro-bono and encourage new member to activity - quizzes, Kahoots, livestreams (Telegram, Twitter, Discord, YouTube): ~$600
6. Marketing - awareness campaign:
- targeted social media ads (FB/Twitter) - $100 per month, per 6 months $600
- Google search ads - $100 per month, per 6 months $600
- possible SEO consultations ~$250
- guest articles on external websites to gain traffic - free
Any remaining funds could be used as community incentives: creative contests (like new infographics), quizzes, lucky draws etc.
Total: $7000
KPIs:
1. Amount of content originally created in Polish
2. Amount of content translated into Polish
3. Number of users that have joined local Cardano groups
 
Definition of success:
a) 1st month:
- setting up fully working website consisting of 20 basic articles (batch of new pieces and those previously disseminated across forum.cardano.org) and current news
- signs of community growth
b) 3rd month:
- doubling the numbers on Telegram, tripling the numbers on Twitter
- website with over 50 high quality articles related to Cardano
- appearing in top 30 on Google under terms related to Cardano
c) 6. month:
- website with over 100 high quality articles related to Cardano
- 1st page on Google under term ""Cardano""
- another x2 growth of social media pages
d) 1 year+:
- live meetups of our flourishing community
- video tutorials (probably earlier)
- cooperation with developers (probably earlier as they are already in our community)
- developing into complete Polish Cardano Community Hub

In a way, this proposal is my addition to ""Localize in Ukrainian and Russian"" proposal in another category. 
The idea is to translate as much useful information into the Cardano ecosystem as possible. In this particular proposal as it's in the ""Multilingual resources"" section - I add the creation of new resources (sites) about Cardano in Russian and Ukrainian. 
These sites will help Cardano community grow geographically and will popularise Cardano locally. 
 
After many conversations with people in the Cardano ecosystem, here is my understanding of what should be translated:
- Interfaces of Cardano projects, dapps, sites. (Some of them have teams and budget for this, but other - not. We would be happy to help)
- Translation of Plutus Pioneers program (subtitles)
- Translation (subtitles) for other Cardano tutorials, workshops (i.e. Adamakerspace)
- Translation of the main articles, news from the Cardano ecosystem
- Translation of the main updates by Charles Hoskinson
- Translation of Project Catalyst
We would be happy to hear your thoughts about what should be translated according to your opinion

Our Fund 5 Proposal was to have a team of 12 LangBassadors translating in African Languages. This Fund 6 proposal is to get some compensation for our volunteering non African translators. Our Long Term aim is to make content in all languages spoken by a million people
The Langbassadors have noticed that the best way to mass adaption is SSL : Simplify - Summarize - Lift the Language barrier.
We use white board animation videos to apply mind-mapping techniques that help understanding and remembering education given.
We learned that people new to Blockchain have a ( very typical ) trajectory : Most people came for the money, stayed for the mission.
So SNC aims with the Langbassadors program to provide them all the knowledge needed :

first focus the general blockchain & crypto currency education : We have developed the ""What is/ Why is ?"" - series
""How to ?""- series, to learn how to buy , acquire and store crypto's & ADA's safely & How to propose in Catalyst
a series explaining the unique aspects and opportunities that Cardano offers and the mission we all strive for

We also create news & in depth news content in formats tailoring the more seasoned Cardano enthusiast, but not translated in African of non European languages as of yet before 1-3 are provided for in native languages
Check out the Roadmap on our website and the Proof of Concepts already established during the Fund5 campaign we ended up getting funded for a team of 12  LangBassadors  for African languages for there efforts in making the animations, translating and narrating, for a period of 3 months. 
But the Langbassadors aim to bring our content in as many languages spoken in the world as possible. 
The languages will be chosen in function of availability of collaborators, and size of the respective language. We have had several candidates coming from the developing countries had to retract due to Covid, and also due to economic catastrophy happening there due to lockdowns. 
Our core team of hubs have actually managed to grow, and collectively more than 3000 hours have been put in the planning, organizing and execution of our plans
Language YouTube Channels already created with first native spoken content available are :

Arabic : 260 million people speak Arabic, biggest African language community - Youtube channel already created
Filipino : spoken by over 130 million people
Russian : top 20 world language
Luganda : biggest native language in Uganda ( country of 44 million people ) - Youtube Channel already created
Soon to be launched : Dutch, French, German, Czech, Portuguese, Spanish and several other languages 

For being eligible for funding any Languages will need to have at least 1 million speakers to be a candidate for translation, but priority in first phase will go to the larger Language communities.
The problem with Crypto risk prevention & education is the KPI dilemma:
It's impossible to tell when the YouTube channels will become popular in which country at what time :
that will depend mostly on : 

the Cardano foundation
where and when the projected 100 million of Africans on Cardano by end 2022 and the 1 billion people on Cardano in 2026 will be implemented
when will blockchain become a hot topic in a specific country?

Now in order to do effective Crypto risk Prevention and education, one needs to have enough quality content available to become interesting enough to subscribe on : who subscribes on channels with just a handful of videos ?
But given that creating our first What is ? animation ( duration : 4 min 15 ) , namely : ""What is blockchain ?"" took roughly 40 hours in combined efforts to create and translate and narrate in (almost ) 10 languages so far, it will take an enormous time to make sure the moment blockchain adoption skyrockets through Cardano foundation contracts the channels will be starting to skyrocket in subscribers because so far in many native languages there is hardly ( if any ) information available.

The Uganda LangBassador translating the script took 10 hours for the What is Blockchain ? translation in Luganda ( biggest native community in the country with 44 million inhabitants ), because many cryptocurrency concepts simply don't exist in those languages yet, so he is creating a new crypto lingo.
The Japanese, Arabic & Filipino Langbassadors took 3 hours to translate that same script.
The European Languages have help of machine translations as a basis so editing took on average 30 minutes for the same script. 

It doesn't matter when exactly the implementation of the government contracts will take place, once the videos are created they will serve their purpose for years to come. 
So the question is simply : do you think IOG and the Cardano Foundation can onboard that billion people before 2026 through Atala prism ?
=> If so, crypto risk prevention and high quality education takes so much time that the Langbassadors hope there will be enough time to be ready for when adoption in Africa & around the world explodes.
And the fact that Cardano is now being promoted, and several Langbassadors Local Hubs are formed and growing, show the Langbassador concept works.
So as KPI, we intend to create  10   ""What makes Cardano special ?"" videos, each in at least  8 European languages + Japanese & Filipino, so basically we will create 100 animations with the total funding asked, which translates to 150 USD/Animation on average
Breakdown KPI :

Within 3 months : minimum 3 animations/videos narrated in 5 languages => 15 animations in total
Within 6 months : minimum 6 animations/videos narrated in 7 languages => 42 animations in total

 

Within 12 months : minimim 10 animations/videos narrated in 10 languages => 100 animations in total

 
Video editing , uploading, narrating and translating etc takes roughly 

3 hours per European language & 
5.5 hours for Japanese and Filipino. 
This comes to 35 hours to make an animation in 10 languages.

So 10 animations in 10 languages takes 350 hours for translating/narrating.
Research + actual Script writing and video (animation ) creation & project management takes roughly 25 hours per animation ( roughly 5 minutes long ). 
Breakdown :

Research : 4 hours
Script Writing : 4 hours
Script testing with 3 crypto newbies + script redactions : 3 hours
Animation/Video Creation  : 12 hours
Editing : 1 hour
Coordination & Miscellaneous tasks : 1 hour

So creating the 10 extra 'What makes Cardano special ?' animations  itself takes 250 hours.
Total : 600 hours - all tasks renumerated 25 USD/hour, total budget asked : 15000 USD
Each of the LangBassadors translating the animation is limited to 525 USD/month as reward with an hourly rate of 25 USD if the total time invested is less than 21 hours a month. 
The above mentioned hours to create the animations are the maximum amount paid for the task mentioned. We give talent a chance, but the possible extra time learning to perform tasks with high quality quick enough is the investment we expect our LangBassadors to make
Expected launch date :
Within 30 days of fund receiving the first animation will be available in more than 1 language
 
FYI : Commercial translations

in European languages cost 30 USD a page ( machine translation as a basis to edit ), 
in non European languages cost 45 USD an page ( takes 3 times as much time as European ) since they cant use machine translations as a basis :
This is for non technical translations, there are serious extra's for technical translations to be paid

Offering tools in English is important and currently considered the international language. However, in order to increase accessibility and inclusiveness we are looking to offer the voter-tool https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/ translated into various languages.
With this proposal are proposing to the tools data into Spanish, Japanese, French, Russian, Chinese & Portuguese as we feel these will cover a good portion of the Cardano Community. We will look to add additional languages in the future.
Process
We will use an auto translator to convert the bulk of the translation task. To achieve this we will run automated translation tool (https://www.deepl.com/pro) for each of the six languages. 
Further, in order to support the Catalyst community and ensure quality translations we will engage human translators to undertake the translation of the app into the various languages. We will find community members translators to fill these roles.
From this we will have the voter-tool fully translated into the six languages and the content presented in each native language.
Timeline
Upon funding we have the translations done and implemented for Fund 7 governance phase.
Over the coming months and year we hope to be able to continue the translation of each future fund to be included in the voter-tool. As well as expand the translations to include more languages.
Team
Cardano AIM (Assembly Inspiring Masses) is currently made up Lucio, Victor and Phil and a number of supporters. We are all active Catalyst Community members and currently design and build tools that support the community. These include the popular voter-tool (https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/), the Community Advisor Tools (CA and vCA-tools) (https://cardanocataly.st/ca-tool/#/ & https://cardanocataly.st/vca-tool/#/)))) as well as the community landing page (https://cardanocataly.st/)
Auditability
We will track the number of users from each language group using the voter-tool and make the usage numbers available to the community.
The translations will be available in to the Github repo as an open source content so that they can be used by other projects.
Budget
Calculated on six languages.
Auto Translation: ~$200 per language (depending on actual characters in final Fund proposal submissions)
Human Translation of App: $200 per language
Scripts: $250
Project admin and management: $1000

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Due to language barriers and poor access to the Internet, the French community in Africa is always late to the most trending innovations. International Language Consult(ILC)will spend the funds to create Cardano French Introductory Courses, educate and provide resources to young and women population in African French Speaking countries, starting from Burkina Faso.
According to the Organization International de la Francophonie (OIF) there will be over 700 million French speakers by the year 2050, 80% of whom will live in Africa. As the continent of Africa becomes one of the world's major economies and grows in population, French will become more and more important! Cardano communities should start earlier on, to gain a foothold in this potential economic powerhouse in coming years.
ILC's goal is to train 100 people every quarter who will fully understand the basis of Cadano and how to use the platform to help develop their communities. As stated earlier, Burkina Faso will be our starting point, then we will reach out to other African French Speaking countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, Togo, Benin and more. 
Timetable and Major Milestones
1. An introductory training course to Cadano, in Blockchain technology, and learn how to grow their local community and the whole Cardano communities in Africa.
2. Social Economic Cardano discussion: create a place (physical meetings and distance learning, media and more) to motivate community interactions for a variety of subjects related to Blockchain technology and Cardano ecosystem. 
3. Participate and collaborate with a variety of Cardano events, with incentives from other Cardano communities in Africa, especially from English speaking countries, starting from Ghana and Nigeria. The two countries are not far from Burkina Faso. Help coordinate incentives to students and reward the most efficient participant in leading their local communities, schools and universities. As an example, ILC can introduce for example future trips to Cardano official events, more resources for the specific community like computers, mobile phones, paid tuition reimbursements, etc...
4. ILC will introduce an advanced Cardano training course, 1 year after the start of the introductory one, in a separate funding program. ILC could introduce learning knowledge for example in the area of using GitHub and Slack as collaboration tools, Introduction to Marlowe playground, Introduction to Plutus programming language, etc.…POA would be a great resource to ILC.
Young people and women in the African French speaking countries are our priority. These countries  are far behind in terms of technology literacy, as well as the social-economic development in their communities, as compared to other countries.
Teams Qualifications
1. Ms. LAURENTINE DJATSA
- Expert in English/French translation for many years, 
- French & English teacher,
- Strong business connexions in several African French speaking countries
Mr. NYAGATARE VALENS
An African born, and citizen of the USA for 32 years, introduced to Cardano in 2017 and became one of early investors. He is active in the Cardano community and its technology, by hosting a Cardano Meetup at St. Paul Minnesota-USA. Nyagatare is one of the original delegators to Proof of Africa (POA), an African Cardano pool.
ILC has done a great job in similar programs, such as digital training course programs. The results from these programs are outstanding, and growing exponentially. Adding Cardano to these programs would give incentive solutions, and give young people and women all the tools they need to become active members of the community.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Intro
ALDEA is an already growing community. Within it, people from all over Latin America and the Hispanic world are getting together to collaborate on many initiatives. Some at the regional level, others -like this one- with worldwide potential.
There is a wealth of information that already exists within the Hispanic Community of Cardano. Writers, promoters and early adopters are actively creating this content. We have brought them together in a standardized way and leveraged the information and expertise in order to create the initial set of articles for the wiki, in Spanish. Now, we would like to continue with the development of the Portuguese side of our Wiki; so we can onboard Brazil, a key player in the Latin American ecosystem.
All these coordinated efforts will serve as a launching platform to become the biggest Cardano Wiki, not just in Spanish or Portuguese but for all languages.
To build any respectable repository of information takes time. To make it properly and multi-language, takes even more time. But not when we're working as a community to make it happen for the benefit of all.
The intent is not only to share relevant articles and topics, but also to grow the community and foster collaboration. We encourage writers and content creators from around the world to bring on their own projects and grow their reputation at the same time.
 
How will ALDEA achieve this?
A phased approach is only natural, when the most important metric to measure growth is the number of active members, driven by the up-to-date, relevant articles and documents.
Our Phase 0 Wiki or MVP consists of a working engine, with a given number of articles, members and roles, to serve as a pilot for the project. This has already been achieved and it's available at https://aldeawiki.org
Phase 1 (Fund5) aims to both grow the number of articles and gain traction within the Spanish Community by promoting awareness and spreading the word. This will help bring more writers and content creators forward, making the number of articles and collaboration to grow exponentially. The first phase of our Wiki has already been funded in Fund5: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/ALDEA-Wiki-Cardano-Encyclopedia/352436-48088
Phase 2 (Fund6) will bring ALDEA Wiki to the worldwide stage with focus on the creation of Portuguese content and promoting awareness across the whole Cardano Community.
Phase 3 (Fund7) and subsequent phases will keep on adding languages, organically building the number of articles and promoting awareness and adoption around the globe and the many different community hubs within the Cardano Ecosystem.
 
BUDGET
Similar to Phase 1, Phase 2 will take 8 weeks.
We are asking funds ONLY for ALDEA Wiki | Phase 2 - Portuguese.
 

Content Creation / Incentives for the Community -> USD 1500  
Wiki Configuration: 60 hours -> USD 1200
Profile Management / Security / Administration: 50 hours -> USD 1000
Marketing & Promotion: USD 1200
Hosting Infrastructure for 1 year: USD 720
TOTAL: USD 5620.-

 
BUDGET DETAILS
 
Content Creation / Incentives for the Community
We have plans to actively reach out to the Portuguese-speaking community and encourage them to participate in the Wiki, by generating the first relevant content and articles. To gain more traction on the first weeks of the development, we would like to professionalise this task and not only count on volunteers.
 
This is the list of the main topics that will be covered by the articles of our Wiki (starter kit):
 

Blockchain + Blocks + Transactions + Consensus + Consensus Attacks + Hashrate
Cryptography + Cryptocurrency
Wallets + Nodes + Keys + Addresses + Token
Exchanges + CEX + DEX + P2P
Wallets + Nodes + Keys + Addresses
Mainnet + Testnet + Forks
Whitepaper + Roadmap + MVP
Bitcoin + BTC + Lightning Network
Proof of Work + Mining
Satoshi Nakamoto + Vitalik Buterin + Charles Hoskinson
UTXO + eUTXO
Ethereum + ETH + ERC-20 + Gas Fees + EVM
Smart Contracts
Solidity + Vyper
DAO + Governance
Decentralisation + dApps + DeFi
Protocols + Layers + Oracles
Cardano + ADA
Proof of Stake + Stake Pool + Staking + Delegation
Project Catalyst + Funds + Roles + Cohort + TownHalls + Catalyst Voting App
Plutus + Marlowe + Haskell
Cardano Foundation
IOHK + Papers

Yoroi + Daedalus + Otros
Ouroboros
Byron + Shelley + Goguen (Mary + Allegra + Alonzo) + Basho + Voltaire
PoolTool + Adafolio + ADAPools + Pool.pm + ADAStat
ALDEA + ALDEA Wiki + ALDEA Catalyst
Cardano Components + cardano-node + cardano-CLI
KEVM / IELE
Adrestia
Hydra
Atala PRISM

 
Wiki Configuration
At the moment, ALDEA Wiki only supports content in Spanish. We would like to convert it to a multi-language platform during this Phase, starting with Portuguese.
 
Profile Management / Security / Administration
We need to allocate a few hours for maintenance and general housekeeping of the platform to assure a good quality of the service.
 
Marketing & Promotion
We would like to work together with Cardano YouTubers & Influencers and Marketing Specialists to promote the Wiki.
 
Hosting Infrastructure
We need USD 65 monthly to pay for our dedicated t2.medium AWS instance. We have already asked for USD 60 on Phase 1.
 
KPIs
We will measure the growth of ALDEA Wiki using the followings metrics:

Number of relevant articles
Number of active members (visitors, content creators, reviewers, translators)
Number of languages in which the articles are available
Number of countries using the platform

 
Checklist
How my proposal impacts the challenge metrics
The main metrics of the challenge we impact with this proposal are:
- Number of non-English speakers joining Cardano community: we will measure this by the number of users who join our Wiki. All of them are going to be non-English speakers since the platform only supports Spanish (at the moment), and will support Portuguese with the developments stated in this proposal.
- A sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk with: we already have this! And we would like to keep growing our community both in Discord (https://discord.aldea-dao.org) and in Telegram (https://t.me/elFogonDeALDEA).
Definition of success after 3, 6 and 12 months
This is explained in greater detail in the 'How will ALDEA achieve this?' section above.
Within the 3 months time frame, Phase 1 will be completed and the team will already be working on Phase 2, which will take place between the 3 to 6 months time frame.
For the 6 to 12 months time frame, we'll be working on Phase 3 where the community will already be organically building up the number of articles and promoting awareness on a global scale within the Cardano Ecosystem.
 
Defined expected public launch date.
The Phase 2 MVP will be live by September 30th in preparation for Fund6 Governance Phase. In this MVP we would like to show the first Portuguese articles, so the community has a sense of what is going to be to have a multi-language support for our Wiki.
 
How I address the challenge question?
How can we motivate non english speakers to learn and grow Cardano ecosystem in the next 3-6 months?: Phase 2 of ALDEA Wiki aims to motivate non-English speakers (in this case Portuguese speakers) to produce content. By doing this, everyone using our platform is learning about key concepts from our ecosystem, and an educated community is the bedrock for future grow of Cardano.
 
Our Team
With 70+ years of combined IT experience in software development and digital transformation across a variety of industries, our core team of 6 people includes Technical Leads, Business Analysts, Product Wizards, UX Designers, Entrepreneurs, Business Owners, and Foreing Trade and Banking Analysts.
This combined experience brings all sorts of skills and knowledge to the table. These include technical and business-oriented skills, but above all, it brings creative thinking, problem-solving, resiliency, experience in working for global and diverse teams remotely among different languages and cultures, reporting to stakeholders, and the ability to do all this while having fun!
We are lucky to already have the support of several Stake Pool Operators from the region, senior Cardano enthusiasts and key members of our community, acting in an advisory and promoter capacity, with whom we meet regularly and are already essential members of ALDEA.
 
This proposal is backed by ALDEA (the Latin America DAO - https://aldea-dao.org)) and its Community.

.
What is the Catalyst School?
The Catalyst School is a place to enhance the impact of Catalyst as a whole by improving the contribution of all its different players and roles.
We help onboarding and help improving the skills of:

Proposers
Community Advisors
Veteran Community Advisors
General new Catalyst members

Our main proposal in Fund 5, with more details about the scope and goals of the Catalyst School, can be check here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/The-Catalyst-School/367842-48088
During Fund 6, the Catalyst School has already helped onboarding more then 200 new Catalyst members in our live sessions and platforms (Telegram, Discord, YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIPvRvMoxhmHLUuPPcsMmmg ).
.
How to include non-fluent/native English speakers?
Currently, the participation in Project Catalyst is somehow limited to those who can communicate in English. Those who don't speak English have their participation quite limited since almost all content, meetings and events occur in this language. Also, their participation as Proposer, Community Advisor and Veteran Community Advisor is very limited due to the language barrier.
.
Proposed solution: 1-to-1 and group support in many different languages
The team working on the Catalyst School is itself multilingual and multicultural. We've got native speakers of:

Spanish
Portuguese
Italian
Estonian
German
French
Polish
Croatian
Serbian
Bosnian

We are also partnering up with other community members to offer support in even more languages.
This current proposal aims to provide 1-to-1 support and group support for non-fluent/native English speakers who want to participate in Project Catalyst either as a Proposer, Community Advisor, Veteran Community Advisor or just as a general community member who wants to learn and support projects in many different ways.
Our goal is to provide multi-language support for the next 2 Funds (Funds 7 and 8), and a maximum of 50 supports will be provided each Fund, half an hour per support session. Interested community members should answer a form communicating their interest, and they will be allocated to the appropriate Catalyst School team member. Whenever possible, we will suggest group support instead of 1-to-1 support, so more people can be onboarded.
.
Roadmap and Milestones

Fund 7: 50 1-to-1 or group supports, half an hour each.
Fund 8: 50 1-to-1 or group supports, half an hour each.

.
Auditability
Each Fund, bi-weekly reports of all community members supported so far will be shared with the community.
If we don't reach 100 support sessions until the end of Fund 8, we will continue with the support sessions in the following Funds until we reach 100 of them.
.
The Team
We believe that collaboration is the key for the success of Catalyst… and it couldn't be different with this project!
We are a group of 11 people of diverse backgrounds, but two common passions: Catalyst and education.

East Asia and Southeast Asia region unites culturally and linguistically diverse countries. People in these communities are excited about getting involved in the Cardano ecosystem. Despite having a population of 1.6 Billion, Catalyst has seen very few proposals from East Asia and Southeast Asian regions.
PLEASE NOTE: TRANSLATIONS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE AVAILABLE ON THE EASTERN TOWNHALL WEBSITE
Current Problems and Limitation
Across East Asia and Southeast Asian regions, English is not routinely spoken and a web of regional languages are used [1].
Language barriers reduce participation in Catalyst. It limits the potential growth of Cardano adoption and utility in this region. We experience this, we hear this from our communities. We know Cardano is missing our stories, our energy, and our perspectives of how to use Cardano to increase economic wellbeing.
Team
A collaborative effort, the team bring a wealth of cultural and technical experience to Cardano. We are all very active in Catalyst, and community groups across our ecosystem. We are a diverse bunch united by the promise of Cardano:
Yuta Yuta @yutazz - Japan: Cardano official ambassador, Community Co-Organiser, Catalyst Fund 2 Recipient, certified public accountant.
Yan Tirta @yantirta - Indonesia: Cardano Indonesia community wrangler empowering his local community with education and encouragement.
Mie Tran @mie.tran.0407 - Vietnam: English and International Business major with experience working with western businesses and translation.
Andy Sibuea @zicozibu - Indonesia: Leading blockchain education beyond cryptocurrencies and across Indonesia.
Tim O'Brien @tobrien - Vietnam: No-code pioneer. Facilitator in East African Townhall (EATH).
Greg Bell @grebel - Australia: IT-consultant, writing Catalyst Challenges.
Seomon Blub @seomon - Austria: IT consultant focused on the people-ware infrastructure for sustainable communities.
Robert O'Brien @wolstaeb - New Zealand: Financial systems Software Engineer, Community Co-Organiser and Entrepreneur.
Stephen Whitenstall @swhitenstall - England: Tracks and documents Catalyst. Helping communities like Catalyst Circle and Catalyst Swarm organise.
Felix Weber @felixweber - France: Community Manager building bridges between people. Member of the T&M Catalyst Circle/Swarm/School.
The team represents the initial Eastern Town Hall **trusted seed**. There are no roles, no leaders. Rather people establish themselves over time, through participation. The exteded team includes professional interpreters and translators.
Our Solution: Translation Pipeline and Automation
Our objective is to build and document a streamlined process for content translation and start the development of localised content. We have already set up a simple translation pipeline[2] using Git, Hugo, and Github Actions. We've tested several translation services such as Crowdin[3], Lokalize[4], PoEditor[5], and GitLozalise[6] for the Eastern Townhall to help us organise and gain some experience.
Our initial objective is simple: to get a lot of existing Cardano and Catalyst material translated into as many languages of the East and Southeast Asian regions using a semi-automated system. Gaining experience and building community. Documenting what we do and how.
By semi-automated system, we do not mean machine translation. While Machine translation is helpful as a starting point, it has difficulty with specialised terms and does not read naturally. Human translations will always have a slight advantage. A semi-automated system refers to an ability to queue a piece of work for translation, which may include feeding it through a machine translation service, have it worked on by someone, reviewed, and then published.
We will start to embrace and extend the excellent localisation documentation processes established by Kubernetes SIG Docs group[7] to help us. Adapting the processes to accommodate the varying technical skills and future directions we want to take. 
Work Streams
To establish a functioning and sustainable translation pipeline, we are seeking initial funding to help develop the work we have already started. The funding will cover five workstreams:

Evaluation of translation services and their integration: with Git, Github, Ideascale, and the Markdown-based documentation efforts of the Cardano Foundation.
Design, configuration, testing of a translation pipeline: The goal is to have a small scale process in place that is easy enough to follow and requires minimal supervision.
Documenting translation process & development of tutorial material: Embrace and extend the Kubernettes SIG Doc[7] processes to help with our own needs. Developing localised tutorial content to onboard future translators.
Train the trainers: Run training sessions with Eastern Townhall members to a level of competence in the process such that they can train others.
Translations: Getting up to speed on our workflow is going to require some hands-on tinkering and experience. We aim to translate a selection of Catalyst Guides, Community Advisor, voter education and our own material. That takes time and effort for each language.

Getting Scale: Earn-to-Learn
To get true scale, translations and localisation standards, automation, and skills need to be developed so we can outsource localisation to the wider Cardano community. Doing translation and localisation work as a way to get more involved in Cardano and the different communities. Doing translation and localisation work; learning and earning. Doing translation and localisation work to build a reputation and earn Ada. We see a future that leverages Metadata, Native Assets, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), Machine-Learning, and Atala Prism on the Cardano blockchain to give us language and cultural reach. However, starting simply first.
Collaboration
Translation and localisation of content is a general issue across many groups working in Cardano and Catalyst. We do not plan to do this work alone or exclusively. In the Eastern Town Hall, we are at the forefront of managing many languages and cultures, our plan is to develop practices and automated processes for our own purposes, and share them widely. Everything we learn and do, we hope will inform the Cardano ecosystem at large.
What Success Looks Like
Near-term the Eastern Townhall is able to translate and host Catalyst Proposals as they are finalised. Translated for our four initial languages in the Asian region. Funded project reports are integrated and translated too. We have also translated, and maintain those translations, of key Cardano and Catalyst documents and guides.
Mid-term we would like to expand the languages translated, and we are actively working with other groups across the Cardano Ecosystem to do this work.
Longer-term success means we've established a whole decentralised workflow for translation and interpretation of any document, video, podcast etc. using the Cardano Network as the coordinating backbone. Where one of the simplest ways to onboard and earn ADA in the Cardano ecosystem system is to help translate, transcribe or interpret material (no harm in dreaming big!).
Key Performance Indicators
Since we are using Git, and Github for the Eastern Townhall planning, organisation, documentation, metrics are derived from Github activity and engagement.
Key Metric: Project Velocity[8], defined as a combination of base activity metric of commits and pull-requests taken from Github.
Activity Metrics: captured as project activity in Github and cadence documents added and the speed of translation.
Community Metrics: engagement behaviours broken down into four categories[9] for the Eastern Townhall website, to measure how our work is being spread and used in the Cardano ecosystem.
After One Month:

Eastern Townhall website information architecture has been developed.
Primary content for the initial website has been identified and ported to Markdown.
The entire Eastern Townhall website is translated.

After Three Months:

We have established a semi-automated translation pipeline driven by Git Pull requests.
Evaluated and tested different translations services as a means to simplify translation.
Documented our initial translation process and trained the trainers.
Expanded formats for translations to include video subtitles.
Issuing NFTs for skills, language, and attribution/contribution tracking.

After Six Months:

On-boarding more members of the Cardano Community to do translations.
Added two more Eastern hemisphere languages to our core set.
Tutorial material (documentation and videos) is developed and translated to help onboard new contributors and languages.

After Twelve Months:

All Catalyst Proposals and Funded Projects are translated and published within days of being produced.
We have expanded our core language set to include the ten languages from the Eastern hemisphere.
The translation project is self-sustaining because projects/teams/businesses want to reach our audience in their native language.
The Cardano ecosystem coalesce around similar standards for document management and their translations.

Licensing
All our source code will be licensed under a free and open-source (OSI) license e.g. MIT, and contributions must be contributed patent-free. Contributors will be required to agree to a Contributor Covernant[10].

Blockchain data should be available to the whole Cardano community regardless of what native language the community members use and understand. Our Cardano BlockchainIntelligence (BI) solution already supports most global languages. A user from Japan can search for metadata containing Japanese symbols using our metadata search https://bi.stakepoolcentral.com/tx_metadata_search, and will be presented with search hits / messages according to this.
However we at CENT do not know all languages, and we therefore need support from the Cardano community to translate the site labels and description in the user interface so the site can be read by community members in their native language.
As can be seen in attached data on global usage, you can see the site is used from all over the world, but the vast majority of our users are English speaking. We want to support more languages so users that do not know English still can get access to the Cardano Blockchain data. 
To support this, we need to do some rebuilding of the site to allow the community to request new languages
CENT therefore asks Catalyst for funding of the following changes and additions

Rebuild user interface of complete site https://bi.stakepoolcentral.com to display labels and descriptions in a good way wether they are Spanish, Chinese or Arabic
Create functionality to let users set their preferred site language and that the setting is remembered between site visits
Add functionality so links shared include site language and by this putting users in control how the content they share is displayed when opened
Mechanism to let community members propose and vote for new languages to be added
Mechanism for allowing community translators to register contact e-mail and language they can translate for the site. All translators will be credited in a special ""Site translators"" page
Help resources in native languages 

Expectation is that this proposal will be delivered to the community within 3 months after proposal funding is secured by Catalyst voters

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


a. Problem statement:
(for Vietnamese, I share my idea in the youtube link below)
The English language is still a barrier for a lot of Vietnamese people. While Learning Smart contracts programming languages is an important key to bring Cardano closer to end-users. The easier learning and deploying are, the more people get involved to Cardano's eco-system. We will create a well-training document as if creating dApp with no-code
We plan to translate all available fundamental smart contract training materials to Vietnamese, Add more practical examples, step-by-step instructions for creating dApps, and sharing them with local communities/universities
b. Deliverables:

Phase 1 (after 3 months)

-Translate all available fundamental smart contract training materials to Vietnamese
- Create short, practical examples with Marlowe (In Vietnamese)
- Develop short, practical examples with Plutus (In Vietnamese)
- Create a website and upload documents, creating index and courses
- Upload documents, creating indexes and courses

Phase 2 ( after 6 months)

- Create short, simple and meaningful infographics about training courses
- Broadcast infographics, videos, training documents to big local Cardano groups on Facebook and other DevOps communities.

Phase 3 ( after 8 months)

- Deliver workshops for 02 Colleges of Information Technology Practice in Vietnam
- Introduction to dApp connector, how to integrate wallets to traditional interfaces (mobile app, website)
Our estimated launch date:  15-Oct-2021
c. Benefits to Cardano Ecosystem:
Marlowe has been designed to be used by someone who is an expert in the field of financial contracts or business, but does not have programming skills and experience. We will simplify and localize the documentation, add specific examples and promote them to users in various ways (broadcast to social networks, information technology incubators, workshop at universities). We believe that doing so will raise their awareness about how easy Marlowe is and bring more people, ideas, and dApps to the Cardano ecosystem.
The localization of plutus training materials will help programmers understand the programming methods and build applications on the cardano platform. Enable them to deploy real-world problem-solving apps on Cardano's ecosystem.

Innovatio's proposal for the expansion of Cardano's know-how
The Cardano community is growing day by day, translating and creating multiple contents such as video tutorials, courses, papers, and activities oriented to the education, implementation, and development of the Cardano blockchain technology.
However, the content is distributed across many platforms and communities, making it difficult to translate and consume efficiently. Even native Spanish-speakers who can educate themselves with English content, if it is not organized correctly, end up being overwhelmed and abandoning learning.
 
Why is the content in Spanish difficult to find or consume?
1) The Catalyst community, being in English, has little focus on organizing educational content in other languages.
2) The content translated or generated in other languages tends to be in specific communities with little reach to users outside the blockchain world.
3) The information and content tend to be dispersed, complicating learning or obtaining it efficiently.
 
How will the Innovatio community achieve this proposal?
1. Organization of the translated audiovisual content generated by the Spanish-speaking community on a single website that facilitates efficient consumption.
2. Sharing videos and content from Spanish-speaking influencers that promote awareness, adoption, and education about the Cardano blockchain.
3. Organization of the different Project Catalyst communities with their target audiences and educational goals through a general infographic that provides an overview of the ecosystem at a glance.
 
How does success look like?
1) Website with a high educational value in Spanish and English that facilitates the adoption and education of Cardano's technology.
2) General knowledge of the ecosystem so that each member can decide where to get involved and contribute.
3) Communities providing the translated and generated content to give visibility to their contribution and facilitate reaching external users to the blockchain world.
 
KPIs
1) Number of English and Spanish communities contributing content to the website.
2) Amount of educational content available on the website.
3) Visits and readership of the content uploaded to the website.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Project Goals:
- Cultivate/Curate Cardano-related graphic knowledge corpus
 
The Primary Issues:
- Learning about Cardano shouldn't revolve exclusively around text
- There are too many languages to only address the Cardano non-English gap one language at a time, one text at a time
- Image-based artifacts generated via language-specific endeavors often are not shared across other languages
 
This Project:
Cultivates/Curates a Cardano-related graphic knowledge corpus. Then we will use OCR to recognize text embedded in each image and generate machine translated captions for each one in 58 languages. Artifacts in the corpus would be available for use as supplementary materials in other language specific endeavors (and said endeavors would be invited to add their images to the corpus). Finally multilingual Cardano community members are paid to confirm/improve the image captions and verify the quality of the images (priority for human vetting of machine translation will be given to Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Hindi, Arabic, Bengali, and Amharic).
 
Project Timeline:
In the first 30 days:
- Establish initial criteria for Graphic Corpus inclusion
- Establish initial format for Graphic Corpus storage/location cataloging
- Establish initial Graphic Corpus metadata
In the first 90 days:
- Build Corpus w Seed Graphics and Diagrams
- Test Auto-Translate Capabilities on Seeded Corpus
- Establish vetting and connection protocols / processes for connecting and adding to the corpus
- Build initial Cardano Corpus interface across platforms (e.g., web, Reddit, MMS...)
In the first 180 days:
- Connect initial Corpus to platforms
- Invite existing communities and projects to connect their graphic content to the corpus
- Establish & test processes for graphic and translated caption quality confirmation/improvement via multilingual Cardonans
- Public Beta Release
By the end of a year:
- Integrate community-contributed/connected graphics to seeded corpus
- Implement community graphic and translation quality confirmation/improvement process
- Connect Cardano graphic corpus w vetted community-contributed/connected graphics to platforms
- Integrate corpus into larger existing service to ensure project continuance beyond funding period
 
Project Budget:
Design and Development:
- Corpus Planning, Design, Development $50 per hr * 100 hrs
APIs, Compute-Time, Storage:
- Auto-translation $10 per million characters of translation * 12 months (MS Azure)
- Cloud App Service $70 per month * 11 months (MS Azure)

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Project Goals:
   - Design Multilingual Chatbot deployed over (e.g., the web, SMS, WeChat, WhatsApp)
   - Establish/Curate Cardano-related multilingual knowledge base of communities & info (accessible via the bot and web)
   - Pay Multilingual Cardano community members to ingest/confirm/improve machine translations & knowledge base content
 
The Primary Issues:
   - Learning about Cardano shouldn't require/revolve around English
   - Globally, 83% of people don't speak English & 58 other languages have more than 20 million speakers
   - There are too many languages to only address the Cardano non-English gap one language at a time
   - Language-specific endeavors often exist as islands not multipliers (this project connects existing and future islands)
 
This Project:
Establishes/Curates a Cardano-related multilingual knowledge base. It uses existing language-auto-detection and machine translation to serve speakers of 58 languages in their native language via said decentralized knowledge base with a user-facing conversational / pedagogical chatbot and web interface. Finally multilingual Cardano community members are paid to confirm/improve the knowledge base content and the quality of the translations (priority for human vetting of machine translation will be given to Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese, Portuguese, Hindi, Arabic, Bengali, and Amharic).
 
Project Timeline:
In the first 30 days:
  - Establish initial criteria for KB inclusion
  - Establish initial format for KB storage/location cataloging
  - Establish initial KB metadata
  - Mock-up Chatbot (e.g., interface, vignettes)
In the first 90 days:
  - Build KB core
  - Auto-Translate KB core
  - Establish vetting and connection protocols / processes for connecting to KB
  - Build initial Cardano Chatbot interface / instances across platforms (e.g., web, SMS...)
In the first 180 days:
  - Establish initial KB web output information design/format
  - Connect initial Cardano Chatbot to KB core and deploy
  - Invite existing communities and projects to connect their content to the KB
  - Establish & test protocols / processes for KB and translation quality confirmation/improvement via multilingual Cardonans
  - Public launch
By the end of a year:
  - Integrate community-contributed/connected knowledge to KB core
  - Implement community KB and translation quality confirmation/improvement process
  - Connect Cardano Chatbot to KB core + vetted community-contributed/connected knowledge
  - Establish KB as ADA-generating service to ensure sustainable project continuance beyond funding period

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Having in mind that three Latin American nations appear at the top ten of the latest report from the cryptocurrency analysis company Chainalysis, related to the global adoption of these assets in 2021 it make A LOT OF SENSE to start creating the Latinoamerican Cardano Community with the consistency and with the importance that it deserves.
We need to overcome the language barrier and make Cardano accessible, understandable and 'close' to the billions of humans around the world whose native language is not English.
This proposal will set a Strategy that can be used globally but we will focus on deploying the strategy on the second language with more native speakers in the world: Spanish.
We want to make Cardano to be well known in all its dimensions, possibilities and opportunities for hundreds of millions of Spanish speakers in more than 20 Countries, that right now don't have enough -if any-, information available to get to know about Cardano in depth and to connect with the project, because most of Cardano content is in English creating a language barrier we aim to help dissolved with this proposal.
Cardano could be the most known blockchain and cryptocurrency in the Spanish Speaking countries by just focusing part of their resources to really Start the conversation with the Spanish speaking audience.
Trying to ""cold-translate"" the available content that exists in English to make it available in other languages is not going to make a great favor to the challenge of making Cardano grow both in adoption and community creation.
That's why this proposal focus specifically on one language: Spanish.
The Spanish speaking world includes not only the 20 Countries of LatinAmerica, and Spain, but also more that 50 million people living in USA. 
This language community is so vast that starting a sustained and reliable conversation with that audience will open many layered doors to the growth of Cardano.
 
What Is SEMANA CARDANO
Semana Cardano is a content production and marketing strategy that will create, translate, re purpose, adapt and distribute weekly content about Cardano at the same time that deploying the needed actions to start creating, growing and integrating a massive Spanish speaking audience.
It is going to live around a weekly program: SEMANA CARDANO that will be the center from where we are goin to share videos, e-books, lives and design pieces as infographics, post, etc,
During the weekly videos and lives we  might even give FREE ADA! through little challenges of participation and engagement.
The content will be covering 4 axes*
1. Cardano for Developers and Project Creatives> the opportunities, the manuals to start coding a creating, all the needed material to tease, educate and help developers and creatives start creating on Cardano.
2. Cardano as the most scientific approached blockchain and the solution of many of the problems that are inherent to bitcoin and other projects> the technology, the phylosophy, the community and all the amazing features that makes Cardano the most exciting and promising blockchain project in existance.
3. Cardano as the amazing investment it has been and is for every ADA holder> the results of the last years, the amazing performance in the present days and the super future that expects to every ADA holder for the next years to come.
4. Cardano as the best environment to deploy De-FI projects and Dapps> we will educate deeply on De-Fi and how the future of finances has already start and helps millions of people get better results on their investments & financial products. (There is NONE project explaining this to the Latin American region and we will be the first ones!)
* the axes and subjects of the content can change and will, according to community feedback.
 
-We are going to work with the ambassadors and translators, and if budget allows it get our own team of translators to constantly keep a list of the most relevant content about Cardano deployed in English to make it available for the Spanish speaking audience.
-We are going to create an ever growing mailing list where the audience that our content will reach will be nurtured constantly and directed every week to SEMANA CARDANO content and news.
-We are going to make content to create Interest in developers to start working on Cardano and linking them to translated  resources for people who might want to learn how to code smart contracts with Plutus or Marlowe for example.
-We are going to create content about ADA and the amazing technology that makes it so much better that the only 2 biggest Cryptos out there.
-We are going to create content about ADA as the amazing investment is its and has been in since creation.
-We are going to create content about Project Catalyst and also translate all that is needed for the Spanish Speaking people understands the amazing opportunity the Catalyst represents and even presenting SEMANA CARDANO as a success story on getting a project funded.
-We are going to listen to the community and address topics that matter to the Spanish Community.
-We are going to totally disrupt the way Cardano has been communicating with new markets and make a system that will create an ever growing audience.
and the most cool thing is that we are going to present during the 6 month a blueprint of actions and strategies so they can be applied in other languages too, incentivizing the creation of other versions of SEMANA CARDANO in different languages.
 
SEMANA CARDANO will position Cardano as the first Blockchain and Crypto project to address the Spanish Speaking Community with this level of strategy and commitment.
This will create a new entrance door to Cardano for hundreds of million of people speaking Spanish worldwide.
We will also 'evangelize' to people that are not even familiar with the crypto community and project or even don't know much about De-Fi and crypto investment, making it easy for them to start understanding the amazing future that expects to every ADA holder and Community in the next years.
BOTTOM LINE
-We are going to address the Spanish Speaking Community as any crypto project has ever done before.
-While doing it we will create a template that will allowed other proposers to replicate the strategy in their own language niche.
Defining success
In the next 6 month after launching SEMANA CARDANO will be positioned as the most viewed and share content in Spanish about Cardano and Crypto Projects and Investments.
Having and active and solid community around the content of SEMANA CARDANO.
Having a mailing list of more than 10000 active members.
Having a ""Bible"" of linked content about Cardano in Spanish.
Being ready after six month to deploy phase 2 of this strategy and keep solidifying the Cardano presence, understanding, adoption and participation with the Spanish Speaking Community.
 
REWARDS IN ADA WILL BE AN AMAZING INCENTIVE FOR BOTH  CRYPTO ENTHUSIAST AND NEOPHITES TO PAY ATENTION
TO SEMANA CARDANO AND WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT EVERYTHING!
 
About Team and Budget
Having been working on the TV and publicity sector for so many years, I know that this types of campaigns are better address in a more 'guerrilla style' rather of trying to set a small fixed team.
Also, being spoken in so many countries Spanish give us the opportunity to start working with local people of different  places in order to create and deliver content and interact.
We are asking for this first phase of the projects between 21 000 and 27 000 + ADA to give as rewards and prices.
The difference between the smaller budget and the bigger one is to have an inside team of translators translating content all the time than then will be linked via SEMANA CARDANO.
This budget will be distributed like this:
Viable  Budget:
24 000/6 months
4000/month*6months
900/month Project Management 
3100/month>  775  Weekly Content 
                                325/week Web/Marketing y Social= Desing, Social media, Post and Bloggin
                                  -Social media management, designer, copy writing, translations, Ads.
                                450/week Lives y Videos> SEMANA CARDANO Live and Recorded Videos
                                 -Camera, Edition, Audio recording, Content Writing, Presentations, Presenter
 
Perfect Budget: 27000 >more in house translation team, more ads, more content, more reach.
Guerrilla Budget: 21 000> less ads, less content, bootstrapping production.
 
SUPER BONUS>
This proposal has a direct impact on the problems address in some other of the challenges, so with this little investment we are going to see results not only on the availability of Cardano material in the one of the most important languages in the word but this also will help to achieve goals in this other challenges:
Direct Impact on Challenges:
-  Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs > With SEMANA CARDANO we will reach the crypto enthusiast of every Spanish Speaking making special emphasis on the countries with bigger crypto adoption on the last 2 years country.  While educating, motivating and growing this communities we will invite people to be Cardano ambassadors and connect with each other creating new hubs.
-++Proposer outreach >++With SEMANA CARDANO we will reach a lot of entrepreneurs that are currently  outside the Cardano ecosystem and we will encourage them and guide them (through content in Spanish about Project Catalyst) to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds.
Indirect Impact on Challenges: 
Scale-UP Cardano's DeFi Ecosystem:  As we reach out to programmers and developers in the Spanish-speaking region with our content, we will guide and motivate and encourage DeFi teams to build/deploy open finance solutions on Cardano in the next 6 months.
IF YOU LOVE CARDANO AS I DO, AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF IMPLEMENTING REAL STRATEGIES TO GROW ON KEY REGIONS TO HELP CARDANO 'TAKE THE WORLD' FOLOWING INTELIGENT AND WELL COORDINATED STEPS, PLEASE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND LET ME MAKE CARDANO THE MOST KNOW BLOCKCHAIN PROJECT IN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF SPANISH SPEAKING COUNTRIES.
Thanks for reading, for your attention and your support!
The feedback from the community will help finish the details to make this proposal even better!
Best Regards to you all!

# What are we going to deliver to Chinese audience ?
- Project Catalyst
- Technology introductions
- Developer guide
# How is the content going to be delivered?
We mostly communicate using English. However, to get more Chinese investors & developers to get to know about what's going on in the community, we need to:
1. Select the most popular projects and ideas (based on kudos and other factors), contact with idea publishers if possible, and then make a translated version of that idea.
2. Peer review
3. Publish
# Where are we going to publish the content?
1. Continuous Effort in Updating info to Cardano Tieba Forum, (A reddit like chatting plaform hosted by Baidu).
Suggested by @Abacuswang, Zhihu and Weibo are also taken into account as publishing platforms.
2. 
For some really good content, we can consider making videos instead of posting threads, on Bilibili, a very popular video platform in China.
For the first year I'll be doing these on weekends, with the Chinese community growing, more people will get to know Cardano, and take part in the development.
# How is the workload ?
For Project Catalyst, we select at least 5 popular proposals every month, translate them into plain Chinese and publish.
At least one video (~15 min) with Chinese captions, explain the technology or latest things in Cardano community every month.
 
Requested funds: 4 platforms * 12 months * 5 * 40 usd + 12 months * 200 usd
# What is your expectation?
Currently, Cardano is rising quickly. Personally, I embrace the Cardano community, as I'm a developer and deeply impressed by the technology Cardano has brought, and the bright future it may lead. Compared to other big proposals, my proposal may be small, and only focus on breaking the language barrier. But as I do so, I'll try my best to deliver the best content I could, so that more and more people in China will be interested in Cardano, and our community will grow stronger.

#日本語内容について

#Why Japan matters?
Historically, Cardano ICO was principally taken in Japan in 2015, so there are a significant number of ""whale-holders"" in Japan. Currently, 600M ADA are staking with Japanese Stakepools, and that shows Japan is one of the most important countries in the Cardano community.
ADA is going to be listed on Japanese exchange BITPOINT(https://www.bitpoint.co.jp/) in 25th August 2021 even though cryptocurrency regulations in Japan are very strict. It will be more important for Japanese communities to increase Japanese SPOs, in order to deliver the right information about Cardano to Japanese crypto-investors.
 
#Why Japanese support is necessary?
According to an educational research, the average English skill of Japanese people is merely the 53rd in major 100 countries. This research says that majority of Japanese working adults can only make a simple conversation in English.
Likewise, there are a few English-speaking people in Japanese Cardano community, and this leads few people to share technical updates.
There is only a little Cardano technical information written in Japanese, so that this is one of the biggest problems to make Cardano communities larger in Japan.
・English skills of Japanese
https://www.nippon.com/en/japan-data/h00594/japan%E2%80%99s-english-proficiency-drops-among-non-english-speaking-countries.html
 
#Our issues to operate stake pool in Japan and measures that we have done
All literatures of Cardano ecosystem are written in English.
So there is a little opportunities for non-English-speaking Japanese to build a Stakepool.
e.g.
・Difficulty of understanding instruction manuals in English
・Difficulty of communicating within English speaker's community when we need to solve technical issues
After Shelley hard fork, we started to manage SPO Japan community(SPO JAPAN GUILD) and created a stake pool building instruction manual because we thought that the number of Japanese SPO would not increase without linguistic and technical supports.
Our community and manuals are free of charge, and we have supported all the people even if they don't have knowledge of server operating.
The fact that there were a few Japanese SPOs in 2020 (before our community run), but now we have more than 60 SPOs in our community! And 424 people have already joined.

#Our current issues
We are going to continue managing the community, updating manuals, and having SPOs study meetings on a regular basis because the amount of work and the knowledge required as a SPO are increasing due to smart contract and so on. We would like to sustain our activities, however, the maintenance costs are increasing.
We have stake pool building manual and Japanese community but there is no Japanese documents about ouroboros protocol. So far, searching past logs in our community channel is the only way to find the information of those.
To secure Cardano ecosystem network, all SPOs should be provided common information.Japanese contents of operating Stakepool will lead Japanese Cardano community to the right path.

We would like to ask for a fund for creating content and managing community for the next 6 months, and for all the work we have accomplished on our community.

Purpose of Proposal:
To some degree most programmers will need to know some level of English to be competitive in today's global job market/economy. But how do we catch these people that didn't even know they would be interested in such a path?
It is one thing for someone who knows that they want to delve into the black hole of Distributed Ledger Technology, but it is something else to even get people to come into this space when they had no interest or exposure to begin with. Therefore it is crucial to have introductory information available in as many languages as possible in order to spark interest in young people to even consider becoming programmers or get involved in Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology.
At WADA, our education approach has two main targets:
Governments/Entrepreneurs (less technical audience) We seek to educate the general public in Cardano as well as the broader topic of Distributed Ledger Technology in order to encourage people into the space, and start getting government and banking officials to accept this technology. This will be very important especially in countries where such officials are already hesitant and are starting to implement legislation or other obstacles that provide significant roadblocks to adoption.
Developers (technical training) We want to focus on training developers in functional programming languages such as Haskell, Plutus, and Elm so we can actually implement this incredible technology to solve specific problems.
Our goal is to get people onboard, and also provide the technical backup to be able to actually follow through with specific projects and solutions that use DLT.
How do we impact the challenge?
WADA's network is rapidly expanding and every day we have new developers looking to join us. Given our current developer capacity we are limited in how many projects we can take on at once. We now want to focus our education efforts on training all incoming developers and providing them with a certification so that we can expand our impact. This means offering our training and introductory materials in different languages to encourage diversity in our network. This will be crucial to WADA's sustainability as it will allow us to easily connect entrepreneurs to skilled blockchain developers on many levels and ultimately help them implement their solutions within the WADA network and on the Cardano Blockchain.
How do we address the challenge?
We have already gathered an intimate group of developers who are eager to train others and who are comfortable using functional programming languages. We now want to focus on getting this group together and to train a few more individuals (our group is multilingual with languages spoken including: French, Italian, Arabic--they all have English in common). These trainings will be in English and then the individual trainers will be responsible for creating content in parallel in their own native languages.
Roadmap
0-3 months: Gather our group of original trainers and launch WADA's official training for trainers. The team will be following an advanced Haskell course from https://typeclasses.com/ an online course put together by Julie Moronuki, one of the authors of Haskell Programming from First Principles. In addition to following these classes the group will meet twice a week to go over exercises together and plan curriculum development and content creation. After the initial two months of training we will officially launch WADA's Functional Programming Content Creation/Curriculum Development meetups open to a slightly wider circle of the WADA developer community (but not yet ready for the general public). These meet-ups will be geared at opening up the discussion about curriculum development and to encourage the developer ecosystem (see related proposal for other meet-ups and events on WADA's horizon in Developer Ecosystem).
3-6 months: Continue advanced training moving on to Plutus, and continuing to develop curriculum and engage WADA devs with regular developer meet-ups. Launch WADA awareness campaign advertising for upcoming training in functional programming. Marketing and other awareness materials to be made in different languages especially French and Arabic.
6-9 months: Launch WADA developer training registration and marketing outreach that will be open to all, available in English, French and Arabic. (hoping for other languages as well--will seek more multilingual team members join!) Final project to prove technical skills will include re-doing the WADA website/web-app using functional programming languages.

This proposal in a nutshell:

Increase the quality of the live-translations
Attract new and more live-translators
Pay the live-translators for their efforts
Translate the weekly TownHall meetings

 
The main-problem:
Only 9%* of the world speaks english = Cardano and ProjectCatalyst can't reach the unbanked!
*English as their first or second language
Our Project:
We want to build up an bridge between different languages. They key to this goal are the translators. We already have many people, which can speak multiple languages and could translate. But we all are humans and need food, water, a home and so on. For that we need some money and actual translations doesn't get paid at all. Ok except from the cardano ambassador program, but this one is limited to text-to-text translations. So in our mind, Translators should get paid from our fundings and for all efforts. Also we should give translators the tools and the knowledge to translate even better.
With this proposal we want to reserve an amout of Ada, for the following purposes:

Get trainings for translators
Get better equipment for live-translators
Pay translators for their efforts

In our mind, we think that we should also establish one standard for every translation. So translators only needed to do what they can - translate.
 
 
Our own Roadmap:
public start:

Alain and Jonny translate the weekly TownHall Meeting regularly

In the next 3 months:

Improve the quality of the existing translations from Translators
Pay Translators which already translated content
Train new translators for the Catalyst TownHall
Promote this Opportunity to attract more translators

In the next 6 months:

Increase the awareness about the lack of translations
increase the number of dedicated translators for Catalyst Town-Hall
Offer Translations for proposals

Further Steps:

Establish a main translators pool for the whole ecosystem
Extend the translations over the whole Cardano eco-system

If you want to go International you need to go Multilingual!
 
Our Goals and measurement-metrics:
In the next 3 months:

Have at least 2 translators every week - at least 1 of them is specially trained
Promote in every TownHall Meeting the opportunity of translations
Increase the possible audience by around 40% in average (We count for every language the speakers that can speak the language as their first or second language - We put this in relation to the possible english speakers)
*This one is regarding to the challenge-metric ""Number of non-english speakers joining the cardano community""

In the next 6 months:

Have at least 4 translators every week - at least 2 of them specially trained
Increase the possible audience by around 70% in average (We count for every language the speakers that can speak the language as their first or second language - We put this in relation to the possible english speakers)
*This one is regarding to the challenge-metric ""Number of non-english speakers joining the cardano community""

In the next 12 months:

Established an ""compensation system"" for the translators of the TownHall Meeting
Offer special trainings for every translators who want to get one

 
Our financial plan:
Live-Translations:
75$ per hour of Live-Translation
apx. 100$ per TownHall Meeting
100$ * 4weeks * 3months * 5 translators = 6,000 USD
Reserve for additional translators = 1.200 USD
Translator-trainings:
300$ per Training * 5 translators = 1,500 USD
Website and commercial:
500$ for 6 months
Equipment:
160$ per Micro * 5 Translators = 800 USD
Requested Amout: 10,000 USD
 
Translation and Languages:
Regarding to an statistic from statista only 510 Millionen people of the world speak english fluently.
We want to translate the weekly TownHall Meeting sustainable**.** We think this Meetings is the megaphone of the whole ProjectCatalyst. To do this sustainable and with the most impact we focus on the 13 most speaken languages of the world excluding english:

chinese with 1.300 million regular speaker
hindi with 525 million regular speaker
english with 510 million regular speaker
spain with 389 million regular speaker
arabic with 290 million regular speaker
russian with 278 million regular speaker
portuguese with 270 million regular speaker

[...]

japanese with 127 million regular speaker
german with 118 million regular speaker
france with 107 million regular speaker

*regular speaker are people who use this language as their first or second language in their daily life. We think this is importent that we speak about this complex thematics in an language of their daily life.
For our own measurement we put the translations in an relation to the english language. For an example:
If the TownHall Meeting is got translated into german and france we increase the possible audience by 118 million german speakers and 107 million france speakers, in sum 225 million. 225 million from 510million english speakers are 44,12%. So we increased for this TownHall the possible audience by 44,12%.
The focus of translations is on the weekly TownHall meeting. We believe that the TownHalls meetings are the megaphone of the ProjectCatalyst and concentrate/summarize the complete governance and politics of an week. So this proposal aim to translate the ProjectCatalyst TownHall Meetings as Live-Translators. Why Live? We think it is important that the viewers of the TownHall Meetings are getting the topic live, to participate in the discussion rounds after the TownHall meetings.
The training:
Actual we dont offer trainings by ourself. The price is calculated that every translator can take part of the ""Blockchain Masterclass"" course by the Frankfurt School. The Frankfurt School is an international known business school and also have it own blockchain research center.
With this training the translator will learn more about the blockchain and crypto topic overall. The translator can understand what the TownHall meeting experts say and can effectivly translate it. If the participant succesfull finish the course he also will get an certificate from the frankfurt school.
This will improve the quality of translations and set the translation project on an professional level.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This project proposes to make our library of Cardano educational content available in Spanish. These translated resources will include both written and audio versions of **beginner-friendly** Cardano news, insight, and community resources.
The technical and relational framework built in this phase will allow us to quickly extend our translated content to more languages, and to produce new translated content on an ongoing basis. Language tags, Search Engine Optimization, and grass-roots marketing efforts will be leveraged to spread accessible Cardano resources to new audiences.
Our current website covers Cardano network basics, onboarding paths, news, and insight articles. We invite community involvement by providing an interface to submit new content, comment and respond to existing content, record audio versions of articles, and propose new article ideas. We have 20 existing articles and pages to translate immediately, and we publish new content on a weekly basis. This project will fund translated content for the next 6 months.
Our website already supports multi-language, including:

Detecting User's preferred language, and presenting content in that language if available.
Allow users to toggle between available languages.
Some content is already available in translation. This project will allow us to continue and expand translated content.

We have a Spanish translator on our team, and are ready to jump into the work of translation.
 
About Us
We are two Cardano enthusiasts. With our community of contributors, we provide hype-free, educational news and insight about the Cardano network that is accessible to everyone. Most online blockchain content is written by and for developers and finance geeks. We are building a network of contributors who break down complicated technical ideas for everyday people, and provide relevant news in quick bites.
Our website is a resource for anyone who wants to learn what Cardano is, why they should care, and how they can participate. We want to make these resources accessible to as many people as possible.
Darlington is an engineer by day and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist and entrepreneur.
Stephanie is a teacher and technologist with a passion for helping non-profits navigate and capitalize on technology.
 
Motivation
We see that the next frontier of growth for Cardano won't be confined to Developer forums and GitHub repositories. Instead, it will be among our friends and neighbors, as they start to see and understand the applications of blockchain technology for their own lives and futures. We hope they will see Cardano as the most exciting project out there, and we want to provide a trusted resource to help them learn, get involved, and contribute.
 
Our Values
We believe that Cardano is a powerful platform paving the way for a future that works for everyone. To help connect that future with ""everyone"", information and resources must be available to all kinds of people, and written by all kinds of people. So we put a high value on accessibility and cross-cultural collaboration:

Explain groundbreaking technology in simple terms
Provide a User-Friendly interface and thoughtful resources
Meet ADA standards for differently-abled users, including Audio versions of all content
Provide our content in other languages, including Spanish
Facilitate original content creation from Spanish speaking community members

How big is the market?
Nearly 600 million people speak Spanish - outnumbering native English speakers!
 
Budget
$1,500 Translation of 20 existing news, insight and Cardano onboarding articles for beginners. Paying .15/word for written translation
$1,500 Ongoing translation of 1-2 new articles per week plus other site content in the next 6 months. Article average length is between 500-1000 words, other site content includes additional resources and links for people to learn about Cardano, changing and growing on an ongoing basis.
$1,500 Audio recordings of site content in target language, making resources accessible to more people. This amount allows us to record existing 20 articles, plus new content for the next 6 months.
$1200 Developer Cost to continue the buildout and maintenance of multi-language support. Darlington has donated ~60 hours to build a basic framework for multi-language content. This amount will allow him to spend the time needed to enhance and support the back end of our multi-language content at a discounted rate
$500 Administrative cost to hire, coordinate, and support translation resources. 
Definition of Success
Current website content available in Spanish. (20 existing pages/articles in translation)
Spanish translations of new Cardano news and insight articles over the next 6 months (additional 20 pages/articles)
Translated Content is being viewed in native-Spanish speaking parts of the globe (as captured in Google Analytics)
 
Roadmap

1 month milestones: Website UI finalized to support multi-languages, responsive language settings based on end-user language settings, toggling between languages, and participation by community translators. Begin gathering & publishing translated content.
3 month milestones: All core educational resources on the site are translated and available in Spanish, and a cadence has been established for translating new content (ongoing news, insight, and community-submitted articles)

DirectEd - Donation for Education
Vision
To revolutionize the way financial aid is provided to developing nations around the world by building blockchain-based software that can provide NGO's with an efficient, secure, and transparent way of transferring money across the globe. In doing so, we hope to build trust in Cardano's blockchain technology and hence set the stage for future microfinance solutions. 
This Proposal
As a first step towards this vision, we will develop a stipend platform that will allow talented students who otherwise wouldn't afford to study at university to do so.
This proposal is only a request for funding for further research. In the spirit of Cardano, we want to ensure that our project is based on solid research and that we have a team with the best and brightest people we can find. Hence, this proposal only contains a smaller budget that covers the first phase of our project timeline. Our general stance is that our code will be open source. 
Problem Statement
Problem 1: Crowdfunding and donations services give opportunities to those who have none. However, they lack efficiency, transparency, and security.

Cost-inefficient, due to the need to have many middlemen and verification of the recipients as well as the transfer of funds.
Lack of transparency, a donor cannot trace the money they donate and hence know exactly who the final beneficiary is.
Inability to ensure eligibility, it is currently very difficult and expensive to verify qualifications and hence eligibility of potential recipients of scholarships.

Solution. By processing donations directly to the Cardano network, and distributing them to verified individuals, obstacles such as mistrust, fraud and administrative costs can be eliminated.
Problem 2: Education is widely agreed to be a crucial factor in a country's economic development, yet thousands of brilliant students simply don't have the economic means to pursue a tertiary degree. This is lost potential that we want to remedy.

Few NGOs focus on higher education. This means this is a particularly neglected area and hence more valuable for us to work in.
Interest rates are extremely high, approaching the two digits range [1]. This means that even if loans are available, the downside risk is very high. The consequence is that talented students from poorer backgrounds who may not want to take these kinds of risks end up not pursuing tertiary degrees.
Despite the importance of education, it is generally underfunded and deprioritised. Part of the reason for this is that it is hard to assess the causal impact of more education and hence the return on investing in it. By designing our scholarships with the intent of ensuring that we can also assess the impact of more education, we will be able to estimate the return on investing in education and hence convince more governments to invest more in education.

Solution. By focusing on poorer regions where all students otherwise wouldn't be able to study at university we target our relevant group. To assess the impact of education, our primary strategy will be to combine a regression discontinuity design with some randomisation. This means that students above a certain score or percentile are eligible for the stipend but that we then randomise amongst these top students, recognising that one or two-point differences are not very informative of true ability. 
Problem 3. Microlending using blockchains or cryptocurrencies is unchartered territory which means that trust in the technology must be built up before microfinancing dApps can succeed. DirectEd will showcase the practical benefits of distributed ledgers and hence pave the way for developing successful microlending dApps later. 

A company working with an NGO, purely focusing on donations using blockchain technologies are not as likely to draw attention and suspicion from regulators. This is particularly important in Ethiopia which has a heavily regulated financial technology sector. This will allow us to focus on the underlying technology and practical problems without having to worry about legal hurdles as much.
Similar to how a micro-lending institution would yield a monetary return on investment to the creditor, a donation platform is analogously providing donors ""impact per dollar spent"". This is why most of the underlying technology and code we would develop for DirectEd will be able to also be used for a microfinancing dApp later on.

Solution. DirectEd will create trust in the technology that will be necessary if microlending DeFi protocols are to succeed later on. By successfully showing that we can send money directly from donors to recipient students and follow up on their educational progress, we indirectly show that microfinancing modelled after this is also possible.
How does this benefit the Cardano ecosystem?
This project could have been submitted under a number of different project calls. There are also a number of very strong reasons for this project that go beyond its direct impacts.

Goodwill and positive associations to Cardano as a technology as it will be seen as a technology that can facilitate good projects as opposed to being a vehicle for speculation.
A successful donation platform that increases willingness to donate, is transparent and cost-effective has a lot of potentials to gain traction outside Cardano and DeFi communities and hence attract positive media attention, developers and researchers to the ecosystem.
It can draw the attention of governmental and non-governmental organisations who seek better ways to transfer money or development aid to people in poor countries with corrupt or untrustworthy governments.
Building bottom-up incentives for Cardano adoption. All recipients will need to have an ADA wallet to receive their stipend. As DirectEd scales up, broad-based adoption will follow naturally.

Why higher education in Ethiopia?
At the moment, student loans for ambitious and hard-working students are extremely expensive. Annualized interest rates are approaching 2-digit numbers. This means that many students, especially from poorer backgrounds, will choose to not pursue a university degree because of the inherent risk of putting on a lot of debt. This implies a loss of productive capacity seen over their entire lifespan and such a loss is likely particularly large among students from lower-income backgrounds because those are the ones who currently are likely to opt-out of pursuing a tertiary degree due to the economic risk.
Furthermore, higher education is receiving much less attention than primary and secondary education. We believe that there are stronger spillover effects of higher education relative to other levels of education. The target group is smaller and hence many logistical problems are easier to solve. Furthermore, we believe it is easier to establish the necessary infrastructure at the universities, i.e. that the university reports on the student progress so that further stipend payouts can be conditional on satisfactory progress towards a tertiary degree.
Ethiopia has been our choice because of the Ethiopian government's adoption of the Atala Prism identity system. We believe the potential for wide-scale adoption and more seamless integration of our technology is more likely in Ethiopia because of the identity system. 
How do we plan to address traditional African financial cultural norms and practices?
The first concern we have is not limited to Africa specifically, namely, trust. New technology and banking both share the feature of being something new users need to be able to trust. However, even traditional banking is something relatively foreign to the many people in Ethiopia and other sub-Saharan countries. Since cryptocurrencies are treated with a great deal of suspicion even in advanced economies, this is likely to be an issue in Africa too. Hence, in order to get consumers, firms and policymakers on board, we must showcase the practical usefulness of the technology and build trust by showing that it works.
This is why we believe that building a platform that employs all the strengths of Cardano for a good purpose is the most feasible and impactful medium-term project to pursue as a path towards microfinance in Africa. As we mentioned under ""How this benefits Cardano"", this project brings along many benefits that ultimately will pave the way for building a Cardano-based financial infrastructure in Africa.
With that said, we have also done some research into financial norms and practices that we will have to take into account in the future.

Ethiopia has a significant Muslim population which means that any microfinancing dapp would have to take this into consideration given that Sharia does not allow receiving or paying interest rates [2]. Looking ahead, as the technology matures and microfinancing becomes more realistic, we aim to research Islamic banking generally as well as the specific regional characteristics found in Ethiopia. However, at the present moment, we solve these concerns by focusing on donations rather than loans.
Further, digitalised finance is currently heavily regulated in Ethiopia even though it is now gradually being liberalised. This is also part of the reason why we believe that a donation platform focusing on education is currently the most realistic and feasible implementation of Cardano.

We have also identified key institutions and infrastructure that we will have to consider as we develop our platform.

eQub. Savings is traditionally made through offline savings groups. This is beginning to become digitalised [3]. This is likely something we will have to relate to as we develop dApp for microfinancing in Ethiopia.
Internet connectivity and mobile payment. Mobile phone payments are not yet as widely adopted as the Mpesa in Kenya. Most people have traditional phones but not smart phones. Any cryptocurrency application has to take that into consideration. Integrating blockchain technology with one or more of the competing mobile phone payment providers such as M-BIRR will likely be necessary.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Problem Statement: Financing for higher education is scarce in lower-income countries where a range of economic factors and systemic risks have eroded creditor confidence. Evidence suggests that the efficient channeling of digital capital into growth-enhancing areas like higher education can reduce economic informality and foster upward mobility at scale. Tackling poverty in places like Sub-Saharan Africa is inextricably linked to confronting the shortages of human capital in the region. Economic inclusion and financial empowerment through education and skills training are central to the Cardano ethos; however, Cryptocurrency and DeFi have yet to bridge the gap between the crypto community and the needs of the ""Real World.""
Proposed Solution: Against this backdrop, we propose a DeFi lending application that finances educational pursuits using Distributed Income Share Agreements (DISAs). Traditional income share agreements (ISAs) are gaining popularity due to the flexible nature of the agreements and the incentive alignment amongst lenders and borrowers. ISAs are a perfect application for blockchain and cryptocurrency; however, the tools do not exist in a simple, open, and practical format. We propose a feasibility study and pilot program that designs and tests the efficacy of a Cardano-based DISA ecosystem in Ethiopia. Borrower accountability remains a critical risk in the DeFi industry worldwide. Yet, we anticipate the country's growing adoption of Atala Prism's identity solution to catalyze a new era of trustless governance, enabling higher flows of cross-border DeFi transactions. 
Our reasoning for choosing Ethiopia as our test market is twofold: First, with its young population and open-mindedness towards systemic innovation, we firmly believe that emerging markets like Ethiopia are the perfect testing grounds for new economic thinking. Second, our pilot program will leverage the Atala Prism DID platform already established and running in-country and utilize Cardano Africa's working relationship with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education. This project will also draw on OpenLaw and previous efforts to tokenize ISA agreements on Ethereum (Ma, 2019).
Proposal: We propose a two-phase work plan.
• Phase I is a feasibility study that explores best practices for DISAs in Africa and publishes a whitepaper with an outlined strategy for implementing a pilot program in Ethiopia.
• Phase II is the implementation and impact evaluation of the pilot study to establish proof of concept. To be funded during subsequent Catalyst funds.
High-Level Goals
• Lay foundation for Decentralized Income Share Agreements (Phase I)
• Develop and fund a pilot program to inform the development of DISAs on Cardano (Phase I & II)
Phase I Work Plan (3 Months)
• Conduct a literature review to inform pilot program and MVP development
• Deliver a community peer-reviewed whitepaper on DISAs
• Deliver Phase II strategy and implementation outline
Definition of Success After 3 Months: Completion of Phase 1 Goals
Phase II Work Plan
• Develop a pilot program for DISAs in partnership with Cardano Africa, Atala Prism, and Ethiopian educational institutions
• Deliver an MVP smart contract to generate a legal ISA contract and facilitate lending
Scope: The scope of this project includes mapping the existing ISA ecosystem onto DLT systems. ISAs have several counter-parties, each with accompanying oracle problems.
The parties involved include students (borrowers), education institutions, financiers (lenders), credit agencies, and payment facilitators.
The processes involved include ISA legal contract generation (OpenLaw), DISA tokenization contract, Atala Prism DID integration, Stablecoin integration, Income reporting/monitoring, and payment rails.
Phase 1 Cost Estimate: $40,000
Cost Breakdown:
• Compensation for (4) core whitepaper contributors (3 Months): $8000 each = $32,000
• Legal Consultation: $3,000 for 3 months
• Developer Consultation; $5,000 for 3 months
Phase 2 Cost Estimate: Costs and Items will be output from Phase 1. (The list below are preliminary ideas)
• Smart contract developer fees: TBD
• Legal consultation: TBD
• UI/UX Developer fees: TBD
• DISA Pilot Funding: TBD

An automated market marker that allows people to provide liquidity and borrow money. Liquidy providers can earn money with the fees generated on the plateform. Borrowers should provide colaterals.
The third component will be a system that prevent overcolateralisation. (Allow peaple to provide real life asset like land or house as collateral may be a solution)

# Problem Statement
 
Zimbabwe has a change problem, in many ways, but literally in terms of the supply of USD small change. Many people rely on USD to avoid inflation, however only notes that are generally available are 10 USD and above. If the transaction amount is less than what you pay you must negotiate the terms of reimbursement, every single transaction.
 
As a customer, you have a number of options;

Add items you didn't necessarily want to your cart, trying to meet an even number
Collect a non-transferable paper voucher, in some cases just a signed paper
Forgo the difference, trusting that the teller will remember for a future transaction
Get paid out in Zimbabwe notes, opening yourself up to inflation

 
Paper based vouchers are starting to become the de-facto solution that respectable businesses are choosing, but they bring with them their own set of problems;

They are easily lost, as they don't follow a physical format that is easy to track
They deteriorate, becoming invalid
They are not redeemable at other vendors
Some vendors you will not visit again in months, and potentially ever, siloing the value into the vouchers
It benefits the vendors, encourages them to distribute these vouchers, but with little or no legal requirements on redemption

 
# Solution
 
CheCha is a digital voucher system, which was developed for Zimbabwe, by a Zimbabwean. It was developed using React Native and is already deployed to Apple and Google app stores.
CheCha acts as a trusted third party for customers to provide vendors with micro-loans. Vendors can enter into partner networks, issuing vouchers into a closed-loop system. The application in its current form never holds a financial balance, but rather formalizes the existing trend, while auditing participating vendors.
As well as addressing all of the above problems with paper vouchers, customers now additionally have the ability to transfer their debt between vendors, giving the voucher even greater utility. Furthermore the business model does not rely on transaction fees which are roughly 3-5 times the global average in Zimbabwe for transactions below $10.
As mentioned above this solution is already on the market, however I see even greater potential by introducing an embedded ADA wallet alongside the USD vouchers, allowing users to trade between them, and providing a trusted mechanism for Zimbabweans to become owners of Blockchain assets.
 
# Proposal
 
This will be my first proposal, having participated in the Catalyst in various groups for the better part of the year, I still feel out of my depth, especially as an entrepreneur in this space. Your feedback, and suggestions are greatly appreciated!
This proposal seeks to slowly introduce Cardano to the application. My approach is to create some realistic objectives that can be achieved before the opening of the next round of funding, at which point I will have an improved understanding of the direction CheCha needs to take.
This proposal does not cover the full cost of going to market, and may require additional support as part of Fund 7. I am confident in the project, and require only a solid team to carry the vision to its maximum potential.
My reasoning is as follows:

Request less funds, as this project is well suited this specific challenge, and I don't want to exclude other proposals.
Have time to foster interest in CheCha itself, developing the idea, and expanding on its feature set with Blockchain in mind.
Develop relationships and further partnerships in the Catalyst community based on the exposure this proposal creates.
I have a number of ideas for how to take the product to market. A marketing budget would simply accelerate adoption.

 
# State of Project
 
CheCha was a project I developed personally, however lacked capital to complete the project, and chose instead to pursue my career. I am confident in the time I have available to fulfill my duties as a project lead, and should I need to be more involved I will take unpaid leave.
The project was never marketed, however I had 100 users sign-up based on a Facebook post I published to a private Bulawayo group. Bulawayo is the smaller of the two major cities in Zimbabwe. 2 vendors are participating in the pilot program. Due to budget constraints the launch date has been delayed.
 
# Intellectual Property
 
CheCha is a Zimbabwe registered company, and retains its rights to income earned from the digital USD voucher system, and may impose fees to transfers in and out of the ADA wallet. The wallet will function otherwise as a normal ADA wallet.
CheCha has the duties of related to the service, and must be profitable. That being said my plan is not to profit from CheCha, but become known as a trusted company for Blockchain and Fin-tech in Zimbabwe, and hopefully solving a very annoying reality we face daily.
 
# Objectives
 
In summary, we will install alongside the familiar USD voucher system in CheCha the ADA wallet alternative, simultaneously hardening security and code quality, and prepare a follow up proposal to take this to the people!

WADA is looking to host hackathons in Zimbabwe, as part of the Planting Roots in Africa initiative, which I am very excited to participate in myself. CheCha will be used to market the value chain to developers, and the community at large. The strategic deployment of both projects in Zimbabwe will make Cardano a household name, and ignite interest entrepreneurs to participate in Catalyst!

Wutano seeks to build a crowdfunded model of healthcare, well-being, and wealth creation. The closest explanation of the vision would be the NHS for Africa. The website gives a good introduction to the size of the Wutano network. Sacha wishes to bring CheCha into the fold, alongside a Digital Transformation program of Wutano onto the Blockchain.
CheCha is easy to understand, but Wutano inspires me to be hopeful of the future in Zimbabwe, and beyond.
 
 
# Timeline
 
I have planned this specifically to be in alignment with the next round of funding. I expect all work to be completed, and ready for presentation to the community! The estimate is on the high-water market in terms of competencies quoted to estimated development work. My hope is that I can find cheaper resources, and focus on marketing to the pilot vendors.
 

1 Month (prior to funding): Have team approved by community
3 Months: Have an ADA wallet integrated into CheCha
6 Months: Onboard 10 pilot vendors
12 Months: Develop trust in Blockchain wallets, and have 5000 ADA wallets enrolled

 
# Q&A
 
How I address the challenge question?
=> How can we enable the creation of micro-lending and Defi dApp solutions that fits the African setting?
CheCha is a formalization of the existing trend, that solves a problem unique to Zimbabweans. This is already a micro-lending platform. An ADA wallet integration will provide an alternative means of remittance, and by not forcing this as the primary wallet, allow people to painlessly adopt starting from what they are familiar with.
 
What is the desired outcome?
To enable vendors and customers to transfer small USD change, with low transaction fees. We also see the ability to open a local charity donation portal, and perhaps even allow purchase of mobile data bundles and other value added services.
 
What are the blocking problems?

Zimbabwean banks have high transaction fees
The country is being devastated by hyper inflation
People use USD cash, but don't have access to small denominations
CheCha needs a bigger team, to improve security, and marketing

 
How are we solving a problem?
By asking the local community, we developed a product. It translate directly a process that they already understand. ADA wallets will add another dimension of value exchange, which they can opt into. We provide a simple mechanism to do so. It would become the easiest way to get into crypto in Zimbabwe.
 
In regards to Fund 7: What might the next steps will look like?
While I have no doubt the project direction will evolve based exposure to this community, F7 proposal budget will mostly consist of costs related to sales, and development of marketing materials, and integrations with other ADA token based wallets that serve Zimbabweans. I also really want to create a charity portal! My mother is a supporter of SPCA, but they are not doing to good. And even without being rewarded a second funding round I expect the product to generate enough data to project the profits, and be able to find investment to continue regardless. I have created financial projections, with various billing models, and the project can only fail due to pour implementation, or government intervention.
 
How will you ensure that ADA is not only embedded into CheCha but also used?
Zimbabweans, unfortunately, have been subject to many Bitcoin scams. Those who were desperate invested everything, and lost everything. The term ""crypto"" is generally frowned upon. Incorporating a blockchain wallet into CheCha will discourage adoption, at first. What is important is that an ADA wallet will be presented side-by-side with the USD voucher equivalent. Inflation in USD will generate interest, and furthermore the understanding that you ""hold"" ADA compared to the debt based voucher is also a boon. Not forcing CheCha to be a blockchain wallet, but by providing the option, liquidity and a trading mechanism will foster trust. It is my opinion that this is the best approach for Zimbabwe.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Details on existing problems & proposed solution:
Many people in the formal and informal sectors in Africa engage in Esusu (Obtaining credit) in order to pursue a speciﬁc objective such as purchasing assets, starting a business, expanding their trade or even sorting out diverse bills. They often resort to Esusu since they ﬁnd it hard to obtain loans from banks, however, there is no way of obtaining credit through this traditional means without TRUSTING, KNOWING participants or RISKING capital, hence many are discriminated against joining these traditional credit unions or accessing credits
The solution we proffer is decentralized access to credits without risking capital via crowd-staking powered by Cardano smart contract. Here, any user will be able to set the conditions and constraints.
Why build a solution around savings?
Saving is synonymous with foresight. Its importance lies in the possibility of having money for emergencies or unforeseen expenses that may arise in the future, it represents a surplus in the future. There will be good and bad times, that is why saving is vital to have a healthy economy throughout life.
savings = income - expenses.
Despite the emergence of formal micro-finance institutions, these traditional credit cooperatives are still very popular among religious groups, rural & urban communities, market-places, the informal and formal sector.
Well-invested financial savings can provide an interest that helps to maintain the value of what is saved over a period of time. This interest usually varies according to the risk and the official interest rate set by central banks.
Higher risk can provide higher interest, but there is also the danger of losing part of what has been saved.
Why build a solution with the Crowd-Staking Mechanism?
Crowd-staking leverages the Cardano staking mechanism and smart contract to eliminate the problems currently experienced with using the traditional Esusu/Ajo system. Problems like trusting & knowing participants, decrimation and risking capital.
Saving is more convenient and credit obtainment is risk-free than it would be in the formal financial system or the traditional system like Esusu. Cardano's staking is an excellent mechanism that can be applied to these types of savings finances.
Develop a crowd-staking savings and financing mechanism using Plutus SCs and deliver it to local communities through a mobile wallet for underdeveloped countries without access to the traditional financial system, with a special focus on Africa.
Detailed solution to the problem:
A decentralized, smart-contract powered implementation of defi credit union; a proprietary, improved model of traditional African cooperative (Ajo/Esusu system), that gives access to cash advance without risking capital.
More details on the solution:

Term Definition

CSG - Crowd Stake Group

Description

An investment vehicle in Thrift wallet which advanced the Esusu cooperative system; It allows a predetermined number of savers to contribute a constant or equal amount to a CSG, within a set duration for rewards.
Stake pool rewards from the CSG pool are bundled together to reward one random contributor in the CSG at a time (weekly, fortnightly, monthly or bi-monthly), till all contributors are rewarded. Once all contributors are rewarded, the Time locked contributors capital is released to the contributors, unless they unanimously commit their funds to the same CSG for another cycle.
Why is it good to concentrate rewards on one individual each time?
Advantages of obtaining more capital at a specific time. Savers looking to grow capital to solve their problems or collect faster cash advance without risking their capital.
Any user should be able to set the conditions and constraints in terms of contributors, duration and total amount required.
Example:
A saver initiates a crowd stake group (CSG) which will be broadcasted within the Thrift Network (Wallet owners), with the following conditions: CSG will last a month, 4 contributors are allowed and 500 ADA is required to participate.
After the First week: Contributor A will take rewards of participant B, C and D.
Second week: Contributor B will take rewards of participant A, C and D.
Third week: Contributor C will take rewards of participant A, B and D.
Fourth Week: Contributor D will take rewards of participant A, B and C.
Then the CSG is dissolved and contributors can take their capitals out from the pool.
NOTE: The participants to receive rewards are selected randomly by the algorithm and contributors can only receive rewards once in a Crowd Stake Group cycle.
Listen to our interview with Cardano Source podcast
https://share.transistor.fm/s/556788ca
The Roadmap:
1 month
Start development of the smart contracts to support the Crowd-Staking mechanism, with the necessary logic for generating the token and managing the delegation process and distribution of rewards.
3 months
Start testing Plutus Smart Contracts.
Have a working MVP version of the Crowd-Staking mechanism.
Deploy and end2end on the testnet network.
Design partner models for stake pool operators.
Progress Demo:

Adoption:
Stake pools feedback:
Crowd Stake contracts allow the concentration of different stake sources to jointly delegate to a specific stake pool.
This union empowers the decision of the participants, since the total amount collected will drive the chosen stake pool, in the same way that the users themselves benefit from carrying out this activity together, the stake pool will benefit from these practices.
As part of the project, a partnership plan with single stake pool operators will be designed. Thus supporting and boosting the most needy stake pool businesses.
In the case that a contract does not reach a significant stake, partners with larger stake will be used to try to maximize rewards.
Local adoption:
Support for local languages that drive the use of the decentralized savings system with Cardano through mobile devices.
Blocking problem and evidences:
The connection between mobile applications and smart contracts requires libraries compatible with languages such as Java and Swift.
These libraries take longer to implement, so we will first see the connector available for web applications.
The final integration of smart contracts to put the mobile savings system into production will depend on the availability of the PAB (Plutus Application Backend) implementation by IOHK and, subsequently, adapted by the dcSpark connector .
Future plans:

Integrate Crowd-Staking mechanism with the Thrift Wallet.
Fully functional personal finance wallet; monitor, budget, plan, understand and make informed financial decisions.
Aggregated Lending.
P2P Crypto to fiat exchange and vice versa.
Crowd-funding vetted projects (DAO).
Utility bill payments.

Desired outcome:
Smart Contracts: Plutus Developers = 9 000 USD
Legal registration and licenses = 200 USD
-> Total: 9 200$
Timeline:
6 months development since the time funds are received.

Why StableCoin Wallet with USSD & STK gateway plus Treasury for Adding Value to Africa Raw Materials?

 People in Developed Countries suffer from weak economies with high rates of inflation, causing their savings to lose value rapidly.
StableCoin will solve the volatility issue in the CryptoCurrency Space, bringing trust to the customers and encouraging government institutions to grant us licenses to work.
Africa is rich in resources but poor in income, because they export cheap unprocessed goods, and other countries make fortunes from Re Exporting them.
Building processing systems in Raw materials production sites will create jobs and improve people's lives, in the poorest places.

The Market Selection (Target Country - Rwanda)

Must have the largest number of mobile users in Africa.
Users must be familiar with the mobile digital financial services (applied for most African countries)

Please reference the attached slides for a detailed description of project objectives, approach, expectations, risks, and expenses.
-----------Overview---------------

As Cardano matures to include smart contracts, DID, and other enhancements, there will be new opportunities to disrupt the existing microlending ecosystem.
Today, microlenders exhibit a wide range of blockchain adoption maturity: anywhere from ""non-existent"" to ""implementing our own protocol.""
As the innovators in the Cardano ecosystem begin to explore potential implementation strategies, it will be helpful for the community to have a baseline understanding of the microlending ecosystem from a Cardano perspective.
The key question this proposal is looking to address: which microlending providers represent the best opportunities for future partnerships based on their objectives/capabilities/roadmaps and existing/planned adoption of blockchain technology?
One output will be a living whitepaper, written in GitBook, that can be shared with the Cardano community and evolved as the landscape changes. This document can be used as a foundational artifact for future research relating to Cardano proposals.
Additionally, a single (basic) technical integration with a specific microlender will demonstrate how Cardano can integrate and extend a microlending solution.  A likely option is building a test bridge to Kiva's Hyperledger Indy solution. 
The ultimate objective is to work with a single microlender to establish a strategic and technical pathway to a broader partnership.

-----------Impact---------------
How does this proposal' problem statement fit the challenge? (slide 2)

The objective of this proposal is to work directly with microlenders that have existing presences in Africa and identify new opportunities for Africans to benefit from DeFi innovations.

How will this proposal add value to the Cardano ecosystem? (slide 12-14)

By identifying strategic and technical integration points between Cardano and microldenders, the Cardano community can implement new capabilities that extend functionality in the microlending space.
While individual one-off efforts to work with microlenders is certainly possible, organizing discussions under the Cardano Catalyst initiative provides more clarity to our potential partners and allows us to define clear goals and objectives.

How will the proposal scale to address future challenges? (slide 16)

After initial technical approaches have been identified, new opportunities will exist to build integrated solutions between Cardano and microlenders. Specifically, this can include linking two ledgers via DID solutions.

-----------Feasibility---------------
Team (slide 18)

West Africa Decentralized Alliance (WADA): Skilled team of Cardano practitioners and entrepreneurs, located in hubs across West Africa and the diaspora.
Jon Saginaw: 20+ years experience in Technology Consulting, working with some of the world's most well-known companies. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonsaginaw/
Core team includes: Blockchain Developer (1), Technical Writer (1), Partnership Development Lead (1 Part Time)

Budget (slide 17-18)

Slide 17 shows key activities and outcomes, while slide 18 shows the resources and timelines required to deliver this project.
The budget will support activities and outcomes of the core team across 6-8 weeks. 

Plan (slides 17-18)

In an initial 6 week initiative, communications with microlenders will identify the most beneficial partnerships, and assess strategic and technical partnership models.
Additionally, a demo will be created to link an existing solution (likely Kiva's Hyperledger platform) to Cardano to demonstrate functionality and identify potential implementation challenges.  
Key activities will include: providing a Cardano-centric assessment of the existing microlending ecosystem, identifying potential partnership opportunities, discussing Cardano with potential partners to gauge interest, defining potential implementation options, and creating an initial (basic) integration with a leading microlender.

Risks

A key risk is identifying a partnership model while IOG is defining its own microlending capabilities in parallel.  As this is a large space with many providers, there should be room to explore multiple strategic opportunities. 

-----------Auditability---------------
What Success Looks Like (slide 19)

Positive communications with 3 microlenders, with identification of a strategic and technical path forward with 1 microlender.
While this could take many shapes, an ideal solution will be to demonstrate a technical integration solution with 1 microlender, showing how it can connect to the Cardano ecosystem (and why this solution provides value for both the microlender and the Cardano community). 
Additionally, this initiative will likely serve as the initial introduction to Cardano for many microlenders. The Cardano community can use this opportunity to establish initial relationships and communications channels.

Metrics & KPIs (slide 19)

This initiative will target conversations with 3 potential microlenders partners to provide a general introduction to Cardano, review their blockchain objectives, and determine high-level potential for a broader partnership on future solutions.
The goal is to define and implement 1 basic technical integration with a leading microlender

--Related Proposals--
Cardano Interop NOW: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Interop-NOW/369451-48088

The intention of this proposal is to build 1) a DID/VC Issuer & Verifier platform, and 2) an open-source digital wallet that, together, allows for cross-ledger DID interoperability. Specifically: interoperability across the dominant Hyperledger Indy ledger and the Cardano ledger.
As there will be many DID solutions (like there are many blockchains), interop across these solutions will be critical.
While the Cardano Interop Now proposal builds the necessary connection points between Hyperledger Indy and Cardano ledgers, the Microlender Partnership Models proposal looks specifically at the technical feasibility of implementing Kiva's Hyperledger Indy/Aries solution with Cardano.
Where appropriate, there is expected to be collaboration across these two proposals given the strategic alignment of objectives, and alignment of technology solutions.

Deliver IP training and other IP consultancy services to entrepreneurs to assist them to commercialise their IP.",1,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:41",Richard Nugent,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Richard-Nugent/3099969-48088,,,147000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Our plan is simple. Design and deliver country focussed IP and IA training to entrepreneurs (whether experienced or inexperienced). Help the trainee community understand the IP and IA. We prefer to work in coordination with local partners in a country of interest e.g. Turkey, Malaysia, South Africa, China, Brazil, USA, Northern Ireland - we have suitable innovation community contacts in all these countries already and are also interested to explore this programme in Mexico, Thailand with our contacts there, plus via this proposal seek an innovation contact in a second African country e.g. Ethiopia?
By delivering this programme we will create meaningful and lasting impact with entrepreneurs.
How do we deliver on the DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox challenge? We enable Entrepreneurs to acquire new skills that they can apply to their DLT business. Our focus on intangible assets will ensure that they do not leak value from their operations and that they are able to generate revenue to support and grow the business. We understand the unique challenge of developing a new business whilst operating in an open (and open-source) environment and can help companies address this challenge. 
We deliver IP training to clients on a regular basis and already have syllabii to call upon for this purpose. However it is preferable to agree a syllabus for each type of trainee cohort in each country - as trainees in a cohort will have different requirements and different levels of prior experience.
We would offer 10 training programmes at £6000 GBP each. At 1.4 USD to 1 GBP this equates to 84,000 USD. We can deliver these courses virtually to a large number of people simultaneously however it is preferable to deliver to smaller groups and then to be available to provide support to the trainees individually. Whilst the normal size of cohort is 10-15 in the UK (where we also provide significant one to one support to each trainee) in other countries we often find there is less desire to have one to one support therefore, working with our local partners we can increase the number of attendees of the training to a higher number e.g. 60. Each attendee can be provided with a personalised certificate of attendance.
For a subset of those trained we suggest that IP audits are made available. We would suggest that the local partners choose who should have the IP Audit. An IP Audit looks at the full complement of IP assets held by a company, reviews them, meets team members and delivers a report to the company. In the UK the UK Intellectual Property Office provides grants to companies of £2500 for this type of offering. In the EU there are grants of 1500 Euros. Some countries like Ireland provide national IP Strategy grants for 2700 Euros. SMEs in the UK can pay e.g. £5000 for more advanced and substantial IP audits (generally for more mature businesses), sometimes more. We suggest we offer IP Audits at the UK IPO rate of £2500 with a 10% discount (£2250+VAT where applicable).  Our team members have delivered hundreds of IP Audits - many sponsored (via UK grant programmes) by UK Intellectual Property Office (who review each audit for quality control).
We suggest we deliver 20 IP Audits over the year (2 each month from each training cohort). This would cost 63,000 USD and is excluding VAT if applicable - we do not believe it is applicable  for non-EU parties. If it is applicable we can ask the clients to pay for the VAT portion.

Our lead consultant for this project is Richard Nugent: https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardnugent/ Other key team members include Anthony Coleman and Lawrence Bickers. 
Impact
The proposal impacts the challenge by delivering important knowledge relating to the acquisition, use and commercialisation of Intellectual Property and Intangible Assets.
Launch - public launch December 2021
We can begin scoping this activity in early November. Trainings would (given time for organisation and publicity) occur no earlier than December 2021 with the audits for the December cohort being delivered in January. We suggest 10 trainings from December to September 2022 (inclusive) and 2 audits are delivered each month (20 in total) from January to October 2022. 
Success
Success will be measured in delivery of each training, feedback from each training and delivery and feedback from the IP Audits. Training attendee and local partner feedback on the quality of our delivery will define our success.
We look forward to collaborating with the Cardano community and with the entrepreneurs in the ecosystem. We encourage you to reach out to us via this platform or rnugent@mathys-squire.com for more details.

Overview
The success of project catalyst rests upon the success of the ideas brought forth by the community.
But what if the community isn't voting for the best ideas? 
What happens to a good idea if it is poorly presented? 
——
What if there are strong ideas that are not being selected in the voting process because they are not being communicated with clarity and impact?
I would like to level the playing field by providing *all* of the proposers access to a series of designed proposal templates that will become tools that help them to best present their ideas for Project Catalyst. 
I would also like to help proposers to understand the fundamentals of presentation design and how to build a clear, concise, and powerful proposal deck that will optimize their chance to succeed in having their idea funded.
——
""We're looking for tools, we're looking for methodology.""
 - Charles Hoskinson, Keynote for Project Catalyst Weekly Town Hall, August 11, 2021
What I'm proposing to create is both a set of tools (slide templates) and also a methodology—a set of principles and guidelines to help guide the user in the process of creating their presentation.
Target Audience
I believe that these tools and methodologies will benefit three key groups: 
1. First, the proposers themselves. By providing some structured, well-designed documents to work with
2. The stakeholders and individuals voting by creating a clearer, more systematic process to gauge one proposal against another and to understand the idea in it's most essential form
3. The entire community: by creating this set of tools and methodologies, it is the community that ultimately wins. This helps to ensure that the strongest, and best ideas rise to the forefront in the process and are seen in their clearest possible light. It helps to ensure that the impact of Project Catalyst, and the governance process that underlies it, is as effective as possible.
Community Polls
I conducted several polls on Telegram with the Project Catalyst Proposers, as well as the larger project Catalyst Community, to get a sense of: 
A. The value of the templates to proposers. 
B. What format are formats would be most valuable for the templates. . 
C. If there would be value in having a course on the keys to presentation design, and if so, what format(s) would be most valuable.
Here are the results (2 identical polls in proposer and general project catalyst communities combined here):
Q1: Would you benefit from being able to submit a proposal and professionally design template? (26 total votes)
Yes 73%
No 8%
Possibly 19%
Q2: If you answered yes or possibly, what format(s) would be most useful for you to work with? (Select all that apply) (17 total votes)
Google Slides 76%
PowerPoint 23%
Keynote 29%
**Q3:**Would you benefit from a quick course in deck presentation design? If so what format(s) would be most useful to you? Select all that apply.
Live Workshop 33%
Series of short videos/screencasts 60%
Longer video/screencast presentation 33%
Recording of live workshop 27%
PDF with screenshots 33%
I would not benefit from this 0%
Takeaways from the polls
Clearly there's a perceived community value in both having proposal templates available and also to having resources for better understanding the principles of presentation design.
Although there's no unanimous consent on the format that they should be delivered in, it appears that Google Slides is the strongest initial contender. It also has the added benefit of being available for free to anyone who wants to set up a free Google account, and the ability to export as PDFs which could be uploaded the Ideascale.
Similarly, creating a short series of videos with screencasts would be the most immediately beneficial to the greatest number of people.
I would note that these formats could be built upon in future funding rounds, but for now it makes sense to focus on the MVP.
Template Creation
I believe that 4-6 templates would be a good MVP that provides enough breadth to choose from initially while not creating an overwhelming library to choose from. This, of course, is something that could be augmented in subsequent rounds with different template organization and categories to help further define specific areas of funding.
I would envision that this would be an iterative process, whereby proposers could provide feedback to the templates which would be refined in future stages and future funding rounds to continue to evolve with the proposers needs.
Outreach
The final aspect of the project would entail the marketing and outreach to make these proposals available to they propose us in the community at large. This would take place through multiple channels: via telegram and discord, as many presentations in one or more Townhall's, and linked in various documents and on related resource sites.
Key Milestones
3 Months
Initial 2 to 3 templates are designed and provided in PDF format for feedback to a subset of the community.
6 Months
Based on the feedback, refinements are made to design and initial 2 to 3 decks are built out as Google slides to be distributed to the community. Design work begins and has made progress on the additional 2 to 3 templates  
12 Months
All of the 4-6 final templates are available and actively in use within the community. Based on existing data, measurements of successful proposals to be determined as measured against those not using proposal templates. (See metric section below.)
 
Metrics
Though there are many things that could be measured, ultimately, the best metric to evaluate the success of this project will be to measure how many ideas that use the proposal templates are funded versus those that do not. 
 
Budget Requirements
Proposal Template Design and Revision $10K
Proposal Slide Development/Build $4K
Q/A Testing $2.5K
Preparation and Creation of Video Series on principles of presentation Design ~8 videos @$1.25k/video = $10K
Outreach/marketing  across various channels (ongoing) =$2.5K
Total Budget Required $29K
 
Total Value Delivered
If funded, I believe that this system of template development and it's inherent structure would not just level the playing field for all the proposers, but also raise the bar for everyone. The result would be that the advisers and community Voters would be able to focus their energies on debating the merits of the ideas rather than spending time getting clarity on the actual nature of the ideas themselves.
Ultimately, investing in this proposal is investing in the future roadmap of Project Catalyst. This project optimizes the possibility of greater success for the proposers, the stakeholders, the entire community, and I would argue, the value of ADA itself.
 
In Closing
Thank you for the opportunity to propose for this exciting project at an equally exciting juncture in the companies evolution.

We aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.
Our business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.
This approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services

COST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.
MATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.
TRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?

We solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services. 
 We solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.
Another great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.
The key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.
Technical approach
The web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.

We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.
The definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.
The definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.
The definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!
Campaign suitability
Since our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal will support our efforts to customize Tutorchain for use with Catalyst proposals and general Entrepreneurship advice. Interacting with the Catalyst community, there is clearly a need for expert proposers to connect with newcomers, but it is relatively disorganized (mainly some scattered discord servers and channels) and mainly limited to volunteer efforts. While we are all for pro-bono, community-based work, we think that injecting a modicum of capitalism may lead to huge improvements in results. We therefore want to support an expert marketplace focused on entrepreneurship in the crypto ecosystem. The success of an expert marketplace relies on an initial critical mass of high-quality experts, good marketing to in-need learners, and good customer service to work out the kinks. We are requesting $15k to support these efforts for DLT Entrepreneurship.
Why should Catalyst voters support this project?
While the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good ""geek out"" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.
We think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common ""lack of developer buy-in"" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.
More information
We will be available on the discord server as Sam Gralla#1222 and AngryGabe#8824. You can also contact us using the contact form on our website tutorchain.io.
We hope to earn your trust in this exciting experiment in decentralized grantmaking!

MyVoice is a platform designed to connect citizens with legislation and their politicians on the federal level. At MyVoice we are currently building partnerships with nonprofit organizations and want to show them the benefits of the blockchain technology we will be using to assist them in reaching their organizational goals. Through this we plan to bring them onto the Cardano blockchain where they themselves can potentially start developing their own projects on Cardano which increases the Cardano ecosystem and introduces it to a new market. As we are going through this process, we want to run a case study using MyVoice platform and Gimbalabs tech to explain ""why Cardano is the future of blockchain"" to both our partners and Investors. The lessons that we learn through this process can be documented and shared with Project Catalyst so we can help others create an effective roadmap for members experiencing same/similar situations.

Growthwheel is a widely used tool for small businesses in the US, Europe, Africa and Asia. Access to these robust tools solves the problem.",1,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 22:12",lenkabul,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/lenkabul/3059442-48088,,,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


GrowthWheel was designed around the observation that all businesses – in all industries and life stages – have four lasting challenges in common: They must create an attractive Business Concept, build a strong Organization behind it, develop lasting Client Relations, and do so while maintaining profitable Operations.
If success only depended on neat ideas - every ideator would be a successful business.  Sustainable success requires business skills as well as product development. 
Proposals are strongest when they include a roadmap to success, action steps, milestones and metrics beyond first steps.
GrowthWheel is a well established visual toolbox and *online platform* 
Used by business advisors, incubators, and entrepreneurship educators to help businesses make decisions and take action. Useful for proposers to demonstrate how they will meet the requirements of meaningful progress reporting, auditing and accountability required by Project Catalyst. 
For Fund 7 Proposers:  Including customised versions of these tools in your proposals will show assessors and voters that you are thinking and taking actions to bring a great idea to a sustainable level.
For Funded Proposals (Funds 3,4,5,6): The GrowthWheel system helps startup and growth companies build their businesses through a simple action oriented process — one that stays true to the way most entrepreneurs think and work.
Look at the attachments (pdf versions of the tools) for ideas about the business you may be planning to build. They are parts of the Growthwheel system. There are many more. 
When you sign up to be a licensed client for the Growthwheel program, these pdf forms become an active online database - many integrating with each other and the reporting features of the system. (See attached pdfs).
Growthwheel provides video tutorials for a wide range of the components of the program (see pdf ""Video-GW"")
You will find excellent reference material included below as attachments for your use.
*Use of Funds*
The funds requested will be used to provide services to 

Project Catalyst Fund 7 proposals seeking funding to demonstrate their readiness for funding
Project Catalyst proposals already funded in 3,4,5, 6 to provide meaningful process reports and manage their own efforts

*Budget Breakdown*
$5,000 (in ADA) - Licensing and setting up accounts for the first 10 proposals @ $500 each (funded or unfunded) to use Growthwheel accounts. Beyond 10 proposers licensing and set-up fees will be paid from your project resources.  
$5,000 (in ADA) - Advisory services - 10 hours each for first 10 proposals, helping to implement Growthwheel @ $500 per proposal  
$10,000 (in ADA) - Continuing consulting services for Growthwheel clients @$150 per hour as requested.
Disbursement of funds will be determined by the number of proposers using the Growthwheel system and services required. Unused funds will remain in the Treasury.
*Definition of Success*
Successful implementation of this proposal (funded or not - all proposers are welcome) will be measured by the number of proposers that sign up to use the Growthwheel services

During this Fund 6 funding cycle (Next 30 days)
During the Fund 7 cycle (next 60 days)
During the Fund 8 cycle (next 90 days+)

Their feedback will be a primary measure of determining success. 
Our goal is to see them taking advantage of these excellent tools as their businesses grow over the coming months and years.
*Launch Date*
The system is ready to go today. Actually proposers and assessors can signup even during the Fund 6 assessment and voting period by contacting me.
*Addressing the Challenge*
The Growthwheel System is one of the most comprehensive, broadly ranging Entrepreneur's Toolbox that one can find. Other proposers, assessors and voters can take advantage of the attachments - as is - to help in their business planning.
 Additional information about the Growthwheel System can be found on Youtube. Here is a starting point.

Why is it important?
TIme is scarce and people are generally short of time and resources. SMART ideas and solutions are needed to solve global and local problems. Help for entrepreneurial Catalyst proposers and voters is needed.
Goals for a better world for all have been collaboratively set from efforts across Governments, multi-lateral organisations, NGOs and civil society and have been organised into frameworks of understanding to help guide priority actions.
Funds are scarce and global finance flows must be unlocked and redirected to help entrepreneurs and change agents solve global and local problems by implementing solutions at scale for maximum impact. A lack of experience and knowledge should not be an insurmountable obstacle to solving wicked problems.
Existing Catalyst funded projects tend to lack explicitly clear, measurable targets that connect with goals and frameworks seeking to solve wicked problems that may be external to Catalyst or the Cardano ecosystem, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
The competition and pressure to secure scarce funds is increasing, and has led to a systemic absence within proposals in allocating a portion of secured funds dedicated to monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for instance, and integrating measurable targets and goals derived from existing international, multilateral frameworks and target priority action areas.
 
How to greater ensure that sustainable impact and a positive return on investment and intention is made?
To plan, propose and deliver a project that has measurable impact and accelerates progress in delivering solutions to problems, you need to understand your impacts.
The proposal framework tool CARE © (Catalysing Ambitious Rising Entrepreneurs) will help you to structure your Catalyst Proposal and business plan by connecting users to a world of frameworks at their fingertips.
CARE © aims to be a tool that will not only help people develop ideas and proposals for Project Catalyst but also develop documentation for proposals on the global stage. As entrepreneurs planning projects using standards and frameworks from a global menu of options, CARE © enables and empowers users to maximise their reach of impact and chances of securing the funds to do so.
With a few clicks CARE © facilitates the integration of chosen frameworks, monitoring and evaluation principles and project design practices into your proposal project plan and documentation.
Whether at the outset of a project's inception or during existing projects, users will be able to integrate the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of a project's impacts. This will allow users of CARE © to better measure and understand their impacts.
By integrating M&E and connecting projects to KPIs, metrics and indicators from a global menu across the social, economic and environmental spheres of our interconnected world, Project Catalyst Proposals will be better equipped to target funds not just within Catalyst, but also be steps closer to the world of global finance and capital, venture capital and seed funding rounds etc.
Project Catalyst projects will be facilitated in their journey of internal auditing processes, and better prepared for external auditing, contributing to elevating the standards of proposals proposed, project implementation and tracking in the Cardano ecosystem.
Understanding a project's impacts in relation to goals external to Catalyst and the Cardano ecosystem will greatly enhance the potential scale of impact for each proposal, and open the door to a world of opportunities for collaboration and synergy.
With CARE © your project team can seamlessly create a bespoke proposal that integrates the relevant framework components of your choice, helping to structure and connect your ideas and proposed solution to known existing challenges and problems and those yet to be realised.
The problems of today and tomorrow running across social, economic and environmental spheres require change agents to have access to impactful frameworks of understanding, in a simple, intuitive and accessible tool.
CARE © seeks to be one such solution to help equip change agents with the tools to help build and contribute to an impact driven movement of disruptive innovation, measured and communicated for all to benefit in an open-access and transparent fashion.
 
Key Metrics to measure:

Number of users, using the framework tool - using social media metrics, downloads, feedback forms
Difference in proposal review score of applicants using the toolbox and those not using the tools - comparative analysis

 
Gaps that are filled in the entrepreneurial skills base of project teams from the start of ideation through project delivery - using the tool and feedback into input forms the user journey is captured
 
Sustainability of venture plans beyond the scope of Catalyst development project-

With the help of the tool, proposer/s learn of new frameworks and platforms to seek funding
Use their tool facilitated documentation to seek/secure funds external to Catalyst

Provide a tool for the community to get feedback on ideas at anytime outside the funding process and allow teams to form more easily",9,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 13:09",lovegrovegeorge,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/lovegrovegeorge/3056930-48088,Jakob Dickhaut,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Jakob-Dickhaut/3060916-48088,10500,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
The faster that existing and newer members of the community can share their ideas the easier it will be to improve those ideas into better ones that are communicated clearly and have the maximum chance to find the skills required for the idea to be executed. Better idea flow, feedback and team building should help with creating higher quality proposals.
The purpose of an idea collaboration tool is to allow anyone in the community to submit ideas or even problems to the community at any point in time that they want to share and get feedback on or to find potential collaborators.
Currently the best way for people to share ideas is in the insight sharing part of Ideascale which only provides for one week of insight sharing. One week of insight sharing is not sufficient to start a continuous team building process. Furthermore, the insight sharing phase on Ideascale does not aim at matching issues with skills and services that people in the ecosystem can provide.
By creating a tool for idea collaboration, the community would have a way to add ideas at anytime outside of the funding window to discuss and collaborate on problems they think need addressing. The longer the time an idea is open to the community the better responses and criticism it can receive. An outcome to this should be helping to produce higher quality proposals with more collaboration.
The idea collaboration tool will allow people to submit ideas / problems to a list of ideas. Those ideas will ideally be tagged and may also have skills or services added by the idea creator to indicate they are looking for other to collaborate with. The community would be able to provide feedback to the idea with comments. A simple rating system can also be added to help better ideas float to the top so more people collaborate on those ideas. The outcome of this should be it can help the best ideas turned into proposals faster.
 
Future development ideas
The idea tool is also a great stepping stone towards looking at how can we help turn those ideas into great proposals. Once we have an idea collaboration tool we can look at types of different proposals (events, protocol development, DApp development projects etc) and see what type of information is needed to make great proposals in those different contexts. Ideas generated can then be changed into proposals with a request to add information relevant to the type of proposal they are making
Another area for improving the funding process with proposals is to have different funding processes depending on the type of proposal. For instance, a small budget proposal would benefit from a faster process with less information requirements as it is a lower risk to the community and the need for it could be time sensitive. This idea collaboration tool could help funnel those ideas into becoming proposals suited to these different funding processes. Ideascale is currently the only process used at the moment.
 
Development steps
- Create an idea collaboration form to add ideas with tags and optionally any services and skills required.
- Showcase a list of ideas that the community can filter from based off the tags or skills / services required and also provide feedback to the idea.
- Implement the idea upvote and downvote review system to allow users to review the idea and implement a sort by feature on the idea list so user can find the most upvoted ideas.
- Output the data periodically to an open source repository for other people to consume as needed.
 
Roadmap
This idea collaborator tool can be started straight away and has no pre-requisites to get started. The design and development steps above would be expected to take around 2 weeks to complete with around 3 weeks needed for the analysis, collaboration, maintenance and marketing that will be spread out over a longer period of time.
- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.
- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.
- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed
 
Feasibility
- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps which will be all that is needed for the development side of the proposal.
- Growth - Marketing will be the most important factor for this proposal. In terms of marketing the tool this will include any of the PACE team interacting with the community directly, using social media, town halls and likely comments in Ideascale to try and link proposals and ideas up from people in the community.
 
Impact
- Increase idea flow and feedback - The easier it is for anyone to add ideas at any point in time the more the community can contribute towards what ideas get turned into proposals. Allowing feedback will help to shape the ideas more quickly and hopefully lead to more proposals.
- Increase proposal quality - Providing more time for people to create ideas and get feedback will help to refine the better ideas and filter out less impactful ones that should lead to creating better proposals for each funding round.
- Increase collaboration - The ideas will be created by people who have profiles on the [projectcatalyst.org](http://projectcatalyst.org) website which will help inform others about the person. By being able to contact the ideator, it will be easier to share ideas and receive feedback. This should help to increase collaboration within the community on shared ideas.
 
Auditability
- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.
- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst
- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e
- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7
Success metrics
- Number of ideas and proposals submitted - Increasing the number of ideas added or the number of proposals that were first created through the ideas of the community would be a good success metric to follow. Increasing these numbers can help lead to an increased quantity of quality proposals that have had more feedback and time to iterate.
- Amount of feedback given to ideas - An increasing amount of feedback given to ideas would be beneficial for increasing collaboration in the community. This metric would be a good sign that the community is engaged and improving new and existing ideas.
- Number of teams formed around ideas - Some draft proposal ideas may attract other members of the community to participate to bring that idea to life, the more teams established around good ideas the better for the ecosystem.
 
What success looks like
The success of this proposal will be down to it being able to help increase idea flow beyond what happens on Ideascale. Having a scoring system will lead to good ideas to float to the top and turn them into quality proposals. More community members can easily form teams for ideas they are interested in. The ideas on the other hand will receive more feedback than they would in the Ideascale process which further increases the quality of the proposal.

About Amble
Amble Studio has already produced a range of games that help teams to improve their teamwork and other entrepreneurial skills.
Some of our games are free to play, and we are happy for Cardano project teams to use them already. All of our games are designed to be played by remote teams, using online tools.
These include:

Green Hollow - a narrative game focused on developing healthy relationships in teams
Truck It In The Cello - a cooperative board game teaching the use task management
Awesome New Project - a cooperative board game simulating common project challenges

Please visit our website to learn more: http://amble.studio
Our proposal
We will make a custom game to meet the specific needs of Cardano project teams.
While most of our games have been focused on team collaboration, we are confident in our ability to develop games to build skills for any aspect of the project lifecycle. This includes the communication of complex project ideas, which is in focus for this challenge.
Our process:

Discovery: research into and dialogue within the Cardano ecosystem, to understand the best type of game to develop
Design: an iterative design process, engaging with the community, to build out one of our games
Launch: working with community influencers to ensure the game is positioned for effective use

Indicative project plan
We estimate this process would take approximately 12 weeks to complete, with contributions from Amble's 5 person team.
Weeks 1 to 3: Discovery

Introduction
Queen's University Belfast is renowned for its strengths in entrepreneurship and innovation, ranking 1st in the UK as the most entrepreneurial university in 2019 and 2020 (Octopus Ventures Impact Rankings). The ranking measures UK universities' effectiveness in terms of their production of intellectual property, creation of spinout ventures, and successful exits from such spinout companies, relative to their total funding. Our long tradition of entrepreneurship and success in commercialising research through spin-out companies has secured £155m in capital investment into the region and has resulted in the creation of many of UK;s top tech companies including LSE listed companies Kainos Group Plc, valued at over £2.0bn.
This success, in part, is due to its strategic engagement in 'customer discovery' focused entrepreneurship activities. These programmes have helped accelerate the efficient and effective translation of ideas into commercial and societal impact. This is because they are focused on establishing 'product-market-fit' in the innovation process, addressing the fact that over 42% of early stage ventures identify ""the lack of a market need for their product"". Absence of this market fit is the single biggest reason for startup venture failure. From a single cohort of 10 teams in 2015, Queen's now leads the online delivery of high-impact innovation training programmes across the island of Ireland, UK and Europe supporting up to 500 participants per year.
Overall Approach
The approach builds on extensive experience in commercialisation of early stage ideas and innovations -
 - Innovation to Commercialisation of University Research (ICURe) to help strengthen research commercialisation throughout all UK Universities. (Funding source: Innovate-UK; annual budget £12m since 2018; URL: https://www.nxnwpartners.org/))
- Lean Launch Programme (LLP) uses a lean start-up methodology, taking the scientific method (hypothesise, test, evaluate) and applying it to embryonic business ideas to test what potential customers think about an idea, product or service. Funding source: Innovate UK; annual budget; £500k since 2016, URL: https://www.nxnwpartners.org/our-programmes/lean-launch-programme/))
- DigiSpark (AI/Cyber/Digital) Accelerator (2021) (in collaboration with Ulster University, InvestNI, Innovate-UK and Techstart Ventures)- The programme aims to boost business productivity using digital technologies by supporting ideas that can have an impact in areas including health sciences, agri-food and climate change. (Funding Source: Innovate UK/ Techstart Ventures; Budget £160K; URL: . https://helixhub.crowdicity.com/
- Scaling the Edge (SMEs) (2021) (support for business innovation): An Intrapreneurship development programme for SMEs. Funding source: Innovate UK; Budget £350k (to increase to £4M in 2022); URL: https://www.qub.ac.uk/Business/Support-for-business/Innovation-smes/.
Our programmes are supported by the delivery team at Helix Hub who have specific expertise and experience in delivering training and coaching on lean start-up approaches using the full range of Strategyzer tools and techniques. Four of these consultants and the Lean Programme Manager have completed a 2-day Master Class in with the founder of Strategyzer, Alexander Osterwalder. This Master Class focused on using the Value Proposition Canvas to create clearly defined value propositions and the Business Model Canvas to generate successful and sustainable business models. It also introduced new tools to help test the hypotheses that underpin the Business Model Canvas which improves upon previous lean methodologies for the validation of business model assumptions in real market conditions.
Proposal
We propose to design and deliver a focused virtual training programme around the cardano eco-system to develop a sustained pipeline of innovative technologies that have the potential to make a positive impact within the cardano community. Based on our experience with ICURe and delivering similar online programmes as described above, we propose to deliver a pilot cohort of up to 12 teams. This allows for practical engagement, peer learning and interaction between the participants and the trainers/coaches resulting in much better understanding and embedding of the key concepts. The programme will be delivered over a two month period in late 2021.
The programme will be divided into the following 6 key tasks:
- Project Catalyst entrepreneurs onboarding (2 hour kick-off session approximately 1 week before the Bootcamp);
- Initial Training Bootcamp (carried out over 2 consecutive days);
- Market Discovery Phase (carried out by participants over a period of 8 weeks with weekly mentoring calls);
- Pre Pitch Training session (2 hour session)
- Practice Pitch Session (half day session);
- Final Pitch Event (full day event).
The bootcamp will be delivered by two Helix Hub trainers with expertise and experience in training 100's of participants on Lean start-up methodologies. The two trainers will be supported by up to 6 coaches with experience including Cryto currencies, blockchain and FinTech. This arrangement provides sufficient time for one-to-one coaching during the training days between the delivery team and participants. The training programme will be delivered remotely using Zoom/Teams alongside a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). Queen's and Helix Hub have been using this online delivery model with over 250 teams since March 2020 in other similar accelerator programmes 
 
The Opportunity
An focused programme built around the cardano community will provide training & support and a dedicated commercialisation intervention to help drive:
- Increase skills and awareness within Project Catalyst entrepreneurs
- Increased access to downstream funding and investment within the cardano ecosystem
- Increased engagement with global businesses to support new partnerships beyond the immediate community
- Out-Licensing opportunities
- Formation of new early stage cardano focused ventures
 
We anticipate the proposed programme to offer the following impacts:
- Developing support tools and an online curriculum for aspiring Project Catalyst entrepreneurs
- Early stage validation (go/no-go indicators) using data driven decision making of technologies that have potential commercial application in the crypto sector
- Develop world class solutions to global challenges that fosters sustainable growth, creates high quality jobs and improves the outcomes of citizens.
- Transforming young entrepreneurs and creating professionals able to tackle disruptive grand challenges based around cardano ecosystem 
 
Training Course Principles
We have a simple principle when designing and delivering our programmes which is that participants 'learn by doing'. This means we design our courses with the minimum amount of 'classroom' styled content and focus on allowing the participants to engage in discussions, case study exercises and Q&A sessions. This means that participants will spend much of their time actually building their own Value Proposition, Business Model Canvas models and Action Plans with hands-on support from our expert team of trainers and coaches. Each team is also assigned a Business Advisor who will support the teams throughout the entire process.
 
The proposed training programme will follow the principles of:
- Peer cohort learning;
- Short bursts of taught content;
- Exercises and examples which build up learning in stages;
- Acquiring knowledge through experiential learning.
 
Strategyzer Toolkit
We propose to use the Strategyzer toolkit to train students on the principles, methodologies and implementation of Lean-Start-up approaches.
The key techniques that will be covered during the training course include:
- Verbal Business Card – this helps students articulate their idea in a succinct and understandable way during the market discovery phase;
- The Value Proposition Canvas – this explains how businesses can create value for their customers and helps to design products and services that customers want;
- The Business Model Canvas – this is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool that allows businesses to describe, design, challenge and pivot their business model;
- Testing Business Ideas – this will explain how to use the 'Test Card' and run experiments to test 'hypotheses' as a systematic process to validate new business ideas from discovery to validation in real market conditions. It pairs with the Business Model and Value Proposition Canvases and de-risks the process.
 
The Business Model Canvas offers a holistic view which facilitates better conversations with business stakeholders. Combining the Value Proposition Canvas with the Business Model Canvas and using testing cards offers a more complete approach for commercialisation of new research ideas.

The movie Hidden Figures was the story of individuals who believed in their talent and hard work, pushed back on a system to advance themselves and their community, and did so without role models. The film was respectful of them as pioneers.
Similarly, Cardano's successful Project Catalyst Proposers are pioneers of decentralised, blockchain ventures pushing to create the new system, whose stories are yet to be told.
To see opportunity and act upon it requires an entrepreneurial mindset, tenacity and confidence all of which are advanced by seeing, hearing and understanding others who have gone before. Finding role models whose stories teach others by example to ""sweat the problem"", ""keep it simple"", ""deliver value"" and execute on many more tropes, challenging themselves to do so and never give up gives confidence to others to do the same.
Current problems and limitations
To find the final versions of previous successful proposals is one thing, however finding the background – the telegram and discord messages, youtube videos of workshops, meetups etc – of what happened to create it is time-consuming and almost impossible task. Just how did the successful proposers develop their skills to execute & communicate their great ideas so voters/stakeholders valued the project?
While some may be aware of how collaboration helped, how input received is incorporated, how long a successful proposer spends ""seating the problem"" many don't.
The lack of available fleshed-out examples of the human cost and benefit of being a Project Catalyst pioneer makes people suspicious and fearful that their effort will not be worth it or they won't measure up to the task. We want to change that.

We are educators with backgrounds in finance, blockchain, legal technology, publication media, and teaching. We are co-founders and entrepreneurs and part of a team many thousand strong.
Our Solution: Create a Library of Proposer Case-studies
A library of up-close, in-depth and detailed investigations of proposers and their related contextual position. Showing how their product or service proposal was created and has been implemented successfully allows new proposers to see what their proposal preparation process can look like.
We've had a lot of success with case studies here at Venture Centre. We have run live, in-person events to explore an entrepreneur's story with pre-arranged and in-the-room Q&A's, video's compiled over the course of a programme or event and edited into an entertaining timeline of the ups and downs, and created blog posts written by or for entrepreneurs at various stages of their journey.
The Cardano Library of Proposer Case Studies will;
#1: Tell stories
Bringing the process to life by illustrating who these people are and how they first designed a project or venture and then the process they went through to articulate it well. Stories paint a picture to activate people's brains and to understand what happened and how.
#2: Demonstrate successes
Not only will case studies focus on proposers, they will also demonstrate how Ideascales features, the Project Catalyst community channels have been used successfully. Prospective proposers care more about seeing how others have actually used the ecosystem to succeed than they care about hearing about what you can potentially do.
In this way, case studies demonstrate success. They prove that you're able to accomplish what you say you can do, based on real results and real stories, not just theories. Case studies give Project Catalyst and its community more credibility. They show that people are using the platform and channels and having success doing so.
#3: Leverage our community of proposers' brands
Let us leverage the brand power of our successful proposers and give them a boost too. By showing the entrepreneurs pioneering Cardano, we get to show that they are willing to recommend the community, the process and the platform and talk about what they are doing together with all of us. People care a lot about what other people have to say.
#4: And, we all get to learn lots
These case studies will teach us a lot about Cardano projects. The patterns that emerge around delivering valuable products and services to customers on Cardano can become part of the tools and frameworks created for local community hubs. We'll learn things about Cardano products that we may never have known before by getting a good idea about how our successful proposers are doing what they doing and how their customers are reacting.
The initial library will include a range of:
Blog posts : These are the easiest to publish and can be posted on multiple channels by multiple community members. We will write up the case study as a post, and then hit publish.
PDFs : A formulaic easy-to-read format that includes callouts and special informational sections like 'fact packs' (like recipes the case-study subjects used for completing a task). Links to PDFs could also be e-mailed to prospective proposers when they begin working on the first stage, submitting proposals on Project Catalyst.
Infographics : These will take more time to plan and design to present information in a visually appealing way that's likely to be shared via social networks.
Videos : These can take a number of forms. Straightforward interviews with proposers will deliver a rich experience of the person and their journey. Mini-doco's including artefacts or animations can describe timeline and iteration steps. Panel discussion videos provide an insight into the differences which make a difference so we can notice and respect the limits of our expectations of ourselves and others.
Having created a library of Proposer Case Studies we will hope to work with the Catalyst School and Catalyst Swam to host, position and promote the library.
What comes next: From there we hope to iterate and refine the case-study formats, translate these first case studies into more languages and provide guides and templates for others to follow and create case studies to add to the library.
A note about challenge choice:
We have chosen the DLT Toolkit Challenge for this proposal as this content can serve multiple purposes. However, these case studies will be material to the design of the Cardano Canvas, Card deck and calculator we have proposed in the Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs challenge. With seven years of hands-on experience building community hubs at Venture Centre, we have a deep understanding of what it takes to support emerging entrepreneurs, build their confidence and enable them to articulate the value they aim to create clearly. We want to ensure this content is available to the networks of hubs we already work with, the thousands of others around the world and the ones which are still to emerge from small groups of people who watch or read one of these case studies, take action and make a stake in and for the future with Cardano.
Budget
Asking for $36,250
This funds @520 hours of work @$70p/hr for both research and development, and content creation over the next 6 months (21hrs a week)
Major Tasks

Proposer research
Initial and Case-study interviews
Content planning
Videography, production and editing
Graphic design
Content writing, editing
Animation

Deliverables timeline
Month 1 - Research and connect to conduct initial interviews. Plan content – format, storyboard, animations and fact packs. Coordinate videography.
Month 3 - Establish commonalities. Conduct full interviews. Curate or create animation and digital onscreen graphic design elements. Produce and edit
Month 6 - Finalise content products, connect with Catalyst school and Swarm to coordinate publishing and dissemination. Plan and execute social media campaign.
What does the future look like?
Month 12 - Curate and tag all case-studies so they relate directly to and can be found easily when prospective proposers are using the Canvas, Card-deck and calculator tools.
Month 18 - Publish a book with follow-up stories of the successes for general public consumption.
Why is it important?
People who participate and make proposals are interested in creating projects and ventures on Cardano are challenged with communicating a complex mix of information in order to provide the blended social, environmental and economic returns they envision. They need to know first, its possible by people like them, how to do that alongside and in collaboration with the Project Catalyst community and many of them are new to entrepreneurship itself and the process of executing and articulating their idea.
How does success look like?
The average person will be able to become a proposer anywhere across the world and be relieved to find easily accessible content to help them start and progress. They will recognise themselves in the stories of others, identify skills and strengths they have by seeing the strengths and skills of others; learn how they to can make the human connections in the Project Catalyst community, and build a team o create ventures on Cardano. Their suspicions and fears that they may not be up to the task will be dispersed and more proposers from more people will appear.
Ultimately the result will be a steady increase in Cardano-curious at the top of the funnel and converting them to Cardano-community members and Project Catalyst proposers lower down, resulting in an increase in the adoption and awareness of Cardano, a key, continuous overarching metric of success.
Key Metrics to measure
Number of users, using the tools and difference in score of applicants using the toolbox and those not using the tools.
– To be achieved by setting up tracking on content and working with Catalyst school and Swarm to capture data from their use of the library.
Gaps that are filled in the entrepreneurial skills base of project teams from the start of ideation through project delivery.
– To be achieved by creating new case-studies of those who have had access to the library and documenting how the content has helped with elements of the proposal process.
Sustainability of venture plans beyond the scope of Catalyst development project.
– To be achieved through collaboration with Catalyst school and Swarm

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revisiting the Problem Statement
Project Catalyst is rapidly expanding, and its decentralized funding platform needs to support industry standard collaborative coding, tracking and documentation tools such as GitHub. 1000s of Cardano developers use version control tools such as GitHub, but there is often a gap in knowledge for early stage entrepreneurs who do not have the knowledge to take advantage of GitHub's organisational and collaborative features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introducing the Solution (How I address the challenge question).
In partnership with the Catalyst School – QA-DAO will offer introductory training materials for early stage entrepreneurs to develop skills in open-source tools such as GitHub.
This will be a series of workshops comprising of a short screencast, screen share and a Q&A on the use of GitHub in Project Catalyst projects.
Short screencasts
The short screencasts will be produced in advance of Saturday workshop sessions and uploaded to Youtube. These will provide bite sized introductions to GitHub tracking and documentation tools.
Saturday workshop sessions
The Saturday workshop sessions will be introduced by the pre-recorded screencasts and followed by a screen share demonstration of the GitHub use cases for that week. The session will conclude with a Question and Answer (Q & A) to explore individual areas of interest and provoke discussion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Training Material Content
The training materials will cover :
Introduction to GitHub for entrepreneurs - focusing on using issues and project boards (Kanban) to track and manage projects.‌
Intermediate use of GitHub for entrepreneurs - focusing on GitHub's document revision features. Pull requests and reviews.‌
Advanced use of GitHub for entrepreneurs - static site generation and GitHub Actions. Continuous Integration features.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation
All the workshop materials will be documented and made available in a GitBook documentary format for ease of reference and re-use. All materials will be released under an open-source license.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributed Auditability
The direction of the workshops will aim to discover participants workflows and examine how these may be documented, reported on, and automated using GitHub. This part of the proposal is offered in collaboration with F6: Improve and Grow Auditability : Distributed Auditability ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Distributed-Auditability/366707-48088 )

Prior to the launch of a given Fund we will offer information sessions to anyone interested in submitting ideas to Catalyst. In these sessions we will share best practices, offer help and direct idea makers to helpful resources. We will also offer to refine any idea submitted to Catalyst provided we believe we can help the proposer with the objective of being funded.
We will request a budget of $10,000 to be used to pay the funded proposers to compensate them for their time and energy helping others achieve their dream of being part of Catalyst as a funded proposer.
We will offer help to every single idea submitter by interacting with them in Ideasscale and offering our help and support.
We will further enhance this by offering post Fund analysis of what worked and didn't work for proposers so they can continue to be encouraged to submit, adjust and refine their idea for a subsequent fund.
 
Team: 
The team will consist of Funded Proposers from prior rounds. Ideally we will formulate a diverse team from different challenges and different backgrounds and languages. I will lead the team and not charge the project for my time. I want to ensure the success of the participants so their ideas can become a reality. Steve my IT professional in Cardano Outreach will also volunteer his time towards this project.
 
Budget:
The $10,000 will be used to offer a nominal stipend per hour of $25 to each funded proposer helping to further the ideas of others. We will publish how these funds are allocated and to whom within the team for transparency. Funds may also be used to help pay for equipment related to zoom and streaming, although we anticipate this amount not to exceed $1,000.
 
**We value your feedback and hope you will ask questions and offer comments during the refinement stage!! **
Thank you for taking the time to offer feedback and offer a kudo for support!
We appreciate your vote!
 
During this process we hope to create a community whereby we can connect people who share a passion for Cardano and for developing ideas. During the growth of this project we hope to create channels of communication and develop a hub of innovation to engage idea creators. We hope to bridge the gap of working alone and having multiple people create ideas together who look to us to support and help them shape their ideas. We want to be the ""go to"" point when people are preparing to submit with Catalyst. By forming a team of professionals (accountants, lawyers, and experts in various fields) we will be able to provide the support teams need to move their ideas to funded projects.
 
As for measuring success or KPI:
Number of people engaged by our project
Number of ideas submitted by our community
Feedback from our proposers and feedback from our team

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


How can early stage entrepreneurs develop their skills to execute & communicate great ideas so voters/stakeholders value the project? Let's collaborate to improve our collective skills in a book club!
We all have good intentions to read more books and improve our knowledge and sharpen our saws. Let's take action on those good intentions and form an intentional community to read a book a month to improve our entrepreneurial skill set and meet to discuss and learn from each other how we can apply the lessons of the book in the Catalyst ecosystem and how to improve our skills in communicating ideas, gain confidence in presenting strategy and objectives, and create better outcomes.
The high level proposal is to create a curated list of 6 books to read over the course of six months with community input. Funding is requested to support the work to prepare, host and facilitate bi-weekly book club meetings and perform administrative duties for 6 months.
The book club meetings themselves will be 60-90 minute sessions over Zoom to discuss the book, ideas that were relevant for the Catalyst community, and dive deeper into how we can improve our skill sets together, collaboratively, looking at the material through the lens of seeking to improve skills to communicate great ideas to voters and stakeholders and be better able to execute when funded. Each session will be recorded and written notes will also be provided for the community to use.
These sessions and materials will also teach some reading and study techniques including:

How to take good literature notes
Use a zettlekasten to organize notes
Introduce tools and services to capture notes and accelerate learning and retention of what we read

Roadmap:
Suggested reading list and meeting cadence:

December 2021 - Pyramid Principle by Barbara Minto to improve writing and clarity.
January 2022 - Business Model Generation to provide a solid framework on which to think about and design a business model.
February 2022 - The Design Thinking Toolbox to learn about design thinking and how to apply it to Catalyst projects.
March - May - Community choice. We will poll the community for books they recommend

Budget:

4 hours per session x $50/hr. x 6 months = $1200 for marketing, preparation, and facilitation of book club meetings, and creation of notes, reference materials, and archives of each session.

What will be provided

Monthly face to face book club meetings via zoom open to everyone to discuss the book selection of the month and how it can be applied to those working in the Catalyst ecosystem.

Project Catalyst is an amazing tool for funding projects and networking, but many of us know how difficult it is to get started. If there was a tool that guided new entrepreneurs through the entire process - from the moment of creating an idea, to the execution of your funded proposal - then it would be much more appealing. The best way to accomplish this is through ""visual work routines"".
A routine is the process for completing a specific task. A work routine completes productive tasks, such as creating a business outline, deciding on a budget, and generating a proposal. A visual work routine is an interactive tool that guides users through the process of completing a task, with descriptions and guides along every step of the way. By combining visual work routines, we as a community can converge on an optimal routine that's designed for the entire entrepreneurship process. Vrooli is an open-source project set out to make this vision a reality.
Defining Success
This proposal is for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Vrooli, which is a website with the following features:

Creating and editing routines
Commenting and voting on routines
Viewing and stepping through routines in an intuitive way

Main Deliverable:

Pilot a Train the trainer program in one local LCC/hub to increase the capability of WADA to equip more local proposers to submit quality Catalyst proposals

 ----------IMPACT-----------
How does the proposal fit into this challenge?

This project will equip WADA teams on the ground onboard new entrepreneurs into Catalyst using a structured framework

How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?

By using a local mentorship train the trainer program, we can onboard talented entrepreneurs into the Catalyst ecosystem in a culturally sensitive way. In addition, although our teams on the ground are somewhat familiar with Catalyst, this project will expand their skills to themselves submit more winnable proposals and also mentor other local entrepreneurs to do same.

----------FEASIBILITY---------

Main Deliverable:
A 6-week bootcamp for future proposers on communicating their ideas effectively within Catalyst, obtaining the business skills needed, and finding the rights teams to implement.
----------IMPACT-----------
How does the proposal fit into this challenge?
Bootcamps are a common feature in the start-up world. By giving teams and individuals access to training, guidance and mentorship, we create an environment that can foster high-quality proposals by well-informed and competent teams.
How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?
By drawing upon the wider start-up community, we can onboard talented entrepreneurs into the Catalyst ecosystem, as well as training those already familiar with Catalyst but lacking the skills needed to get their proposals successfully funded.
Outlook and future challenges?
An initial program of 20 individuals and 5 teams will be invited by application to participate. After a series of lectures, training sessions and demos, the 5 teams will be assigned a Catalyst mentor each and the 20 individuals will be put through a 6-week bootcamp aimed at taking them from 'Zero to Funded'. At this bootcamp, they will be pitching ideas, creating teams and at the end will be presenting to a panelist of experts and mentors. We will be following the Startupbootcamp (https://www.startupbootcamp.org/) model for this, applied to a virtual setting, with the help of WADA and their partners.
----------FEASIBILITY---------
Reference (Past Successes):
Having joined Startupbootcamp as a team leader on several of its programs and gone on to be an organizer for an enterprise accelerator, I have experience delivering such programs and am well-versed in curriculum development, session facilitation, and journey-mapping of the participants. In collaboration with WADA and its partners, we have at our disposal:

A membership platform in development for onboarding and virtual training sessions
A learning management system in development to track progress and usage of the materials created
Several networks of interested participants for future bootcamps as we scale
Mentors and experts willing to support both the goals of WADA and Cardano

Roadmap:
After voting takes place and funding is successfully secured:
Pre-bootcamp:

40 days - Curriculum development, mentor and expert outreach, platform development
20 days - Marketing campaign, applications open
7 days - Applicants are chosen, onboarding and pre-reading material is distributed

Program launch (Jan 15th):

6-week learning program of lectures, training sessions and demos
6-week bootcamp, taking the individuals and teams from 'Zero to Funded'

Post-Program:

Proposal submission to Catalyst (with workshops, https://bit.ly/F6Workshops))
Ongoing proposal and mentorship support (where applicable)
Program survey and report creation
CVSB Round 2 Proposal Submission (Scale-up)

.
Hey Catalyst Community!
The Idea Fest for Fund 5 was a huge success and was made possible by the effort of more than 20 people (including organization, hosting, post-tasks, etc.). To continue this event we apply for funding to be able to organize and execute two further editions: Idea Fest for Fund 6 AND Fund 7.
 
Announcement of IDEA FEST Fund 6 in the town hall meeting September 1st, 2021 (starts at 1:00:30):

 
 
____ INTRODUCE THE HOSTS ____
The Catalyst Swarm:
""The SWARM is a community-driven ""grass roots"" initiative, supporting Cardano in its mission to build a universal decentralized system that provides access to a global society and economy.'
CONNECT: We bring the community together to unleash its full potential.
INCLUDE: We build bridges to ensure the diversity of the Cardano community.
EMPOWER: We encourage everyone to act and lead by creating space to do so.
 
The Catalyst Swarm operates and interacts in and around the wider Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals, projects and communities to Project Catalyst. Our activities are characterized by the following qualities:

Listen to the community and gather data and opinions from an unbiased perspective.
Host different events and meetups where the community members come together, share their ideas, connect, listen and get inspired from each other.
Reach out to underrepresented groups in the community, exploring ways to lower entry barriers and offer continuous support and advice.
Integrate local communities to enrich a diverse, multi-cultural Catalyst Community.
Moderate the community discussions in our events and Discord server in a way that empowers individuals to further engage.
Explore novel ways for decentralized governance within our community, based upon practice oriented methods.
Document and track our activity to build trust and transparency.
Reproduce ourselves by creating new swarm groups to have a diverse co-existence and collaboration of several swarms.

 
 
____ I M P A C T _____
 
This challenge is seeking for better communication between proposers and voters. Both parties don't have a stage to interact with each other so far. Also the personal touch of many proposals is missing. Therefore, IDEA FEST for Fund 5 was established and then executed by the Catalyst Swarm Team together with the community.
This event gives proposers a stage to present their projects and ideas to a wider audience. Furthermore, it enables the voters of Project Catalyst to interact directly with the proposers, ask questions, raise concerns and discuss the projects. This will help the voters to decide on which proposals they want to vote and on which they don't. Added to that, proposers have to work on their presentation skills and try to narrow their project into a condensed pitch. As a result the quality of strategy, objectives and USP of the proposals is likely to increase. The IDEA FEST is a great setting for inexperienced projects to use the stage and become more confident.
Furthermore, the format of the IDEA FEST will attract new proposers for upcoming funding rounds as they see the benefit of presenting their proposals and engaging more people.
In the first edition of IDEA FEST, 36.1% of the presented projects were successfully funded (compared to 21.6% for Catalyst overall).The approval rate of the presented proposals was as high as 70%, further demonstrating the positive effect of IDEA FEST.

The World Bank is an institution that facilitates a lot of development aid from advanced economies. They are very interested in being able to assess the impact of their project. Blockchain technology has a lot of potential here because it is possible for individuals to securely provide information that is put on a distributed ledger. 
If we are able to find solutions to the challenges that face the world bank that are unique selling points for Cardano, or other 3rd gen blockchains, then this is how we ultimately can get those institutions on board.

How does success look like?
If funded, with the support of this research Cardano community stakeholders will be able to learn from the proposals of Fund 6 what projects are being implemented that align with the UN SDGs, in what countries, and what hubs currently exist in the Cardano global ecosystem.
 
Key Metrics to measure
With the support of the research, the Cardano community can establish:

How many proposals in Fund 6 and Fund 7 are working in synergy with global agencies and frameworks?
How many are implemented that are using local hubs, and where are they situated?
How many projects have a formal relationship with the Cardano Foundation?
Which countries are represented/not represented?

This will all in all provide a clearer, global picture with which to approach multi lateral agencies such as the UN and provide necessary information and data that captures the dynamic, entrepreneurial, mission driven Cardano ecosystem.
 
Why is it important?
Collaboration with International bodies working in the developing world will accelerate mass adoption for Cardano´s blockchain solutions.
In order to accelerate mass adoption and work seamlessly with diverse stakeholders from multilateral organisations like UN to national Governments, it is important to be able to understand one another, and therefore a common language is helpful.
We propose to research the use and application of one such common language through the prism of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Once this framework is established in connection with current Fund 6 proposals and those that gain funding, we can expand the scope to include other sustainability frameworks.
Doing so will greatly facilitate and enhance the ability for any funded proposal in Project Catalyst, or Cardano project to communicate impact with a global audience, using a global framework of goals and common language. This can take place in hubs, in physical and online spaces.
 
Plan in detail:
The objective of the challenge is to enter into global partnerships with UNDP and the world bank group in 3-6 months and develop local community centers in 130 countries.
To be able to focus on the best partnership opportunities we suggest to focus on a deep research of the proposals ecosystem.
Research gathered will be open access and useful for the Cardano community as there is currently a gap in research carried out for a non technical, non blockchain audience, and also a lack of research from the humanities and social sciences focusing on the Cardano Project Catalyst community and funded proposals and through lenses and global frameworks measuring progress in sustainability terms (Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs, environmental, social, governance - ESG).
With millions of dollars already distributed to winning proposals, and with more to come in future funds, it is crucial to ensure that we measure and understand the impact of funded proposals and that future proposals are funded to have maximum positive impact.
 
Research rationale:
Will look over current Fund 6 proposals, researching how each proposal aligns within the Sustainable Development Goals framework.
Is there a basis to propose a tool that can educate, easily inform and connect proposers with methods of structuring their proposals? In turn, making them more impactful, in a measurable way on a global stage, using a common language within frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals?
Existing funded proposals total +150, with +150 expected this Fund 6. Proposals submitted total +1000.
If funded to carry out further research, we would use the funds to direct time and resources to carry out a wide survey of all proposals submitted and collect information and data using mixed research methods (quantitative and qualitative), online surveys, remote interviews.
 
Research and development:
 
Hypothesis:
Having access and knowledge of frameworks and datasets helps make better decisions, design impactful projects and robust proposals.
 
Possible Research Questions:

Does Cardano's Blockchain Protocol and Decentralised Innovation Fund offer novel mechanisms that can enable entrepreneurs to launch projects that have measurable positive impacts?
How much of the millions of dollars of ADA being used in Cardano's community governed treasury to fund projects are contributing to progress according to global sustainability frameworks such as UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and others?
How many proposals submitted feed into progress according to SDGs?
Have you allocated a budget to monitoring and evaluating your project?
Have you allocated any secured funds from Catalyst for monitoring and evaluation?
Have you used any goals, data or framework external to Catalyst in your project and proposal?

 
Would having access to impact/SDGs, datasets and frameworks make a difference in:

Your proposal project planning?
Your chances of success to secure funds in Catalyst and beyond?
Your project implementation?
Your project impact measuring?

 
Deliverables:

A paper that can be submitted in journals (Frontiers) for open access - https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/18154/blockchain-for-united-nations-sustainable-development-goals-sdgs
A paper to inform the Cardano community of proposals submitted and how they were/are connected to global reaching goals and frameworks (SDGs and others).
A short video that summarises the research carried out/conclusions, learning outcomes into a video (1 minute - 4 minute video for open access usage and knowledge sharing).

 
Budget and roadmap: Total request = $8400
Research and development:
$4200 1 - 3months (Sept - Nov) (Fund 6) Phase 1
$4200 1 - 4 months (Nov - Feb) (Fund 7) Phase 2
 
Phase 1:
September 2021 - preliminary research currently ongoing:
Literature review of current research (i.e. translate a 2020 French research journal 'whitepaper' on Blockchain and SDGs into English - possible other languages too in the Cardano ecosystem) seeking to address gaps in research within the Cardano ecosystem and externally for comparative purposes across the blockchain space.
 
October 2021 - November 2021:
Review current Fund 6 proposals with a voluntarily completed survey by proposers. Determine and assess the current state of Catalyst proposals using the sustainable theoretical framework lens, establishing a baseline survey of Fund 6 proposals that align with SDGs.
Collate results into a publicly accessible database and written paper. Findings of this shorter paper will help feed into a submission of a manuscript for blockchain journal (Frontiers Dec deadline).
 
Phase 2: November 2021 - February 2022
Building on research from phase 1 into the tracked funded projects and their connection to SDGs, will explore additional sustainability frameworks (Doughnut Economics etc...) and how they align and can be integrated for greater project impact.
Will support the development of a multi- framework proposal tool.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


What is ICWT?
ICWT is a token and a platform that builds cryptocurrency events all over the globe. After careful observation we came to the conclusion that most of the events related to crypto are very costly and highly overvalued. The entrance fee is usually starting from $100 to +$1000. We at ICWT are trying to let everyone witness their crypto icons speak without the inclusion of costly tickets. As at the end: knowledge is power. Including the fact that most of the speakers would wish to commence in front of a very comprehensive yet determined audience. We are focusing on expanding the intelligence of cryptocurrencies all around the globe and to make our audience understand the value of it in their day-to-day life. The ICWT token will work as an NFT entrance ticket and the tokens that are used as entrances will be destroyed. So this will make the token deflationary over time.
 
What to expect?
We at ICWT want to create a platform where people can log in and vote for all the functions of the events. Starting from event location, the dates and also the ICWT entrance price. This will be created in the form of an app, so everyone around the world has the access to hold and vote in a decentralised way. The app includes a Token wallet which will work as a payment system for the events and to calculate your voting capacity. Later on, we will try to carry out a forum and a news feed. This will be to initiate a healthier communication and education pattern between the token holders, especially for the newcomers entering the crypto space.
 
How to get the ICWT token?
There are going to be two methods to achieve the token. The first one is the relatively easier one as you can buy them on our IDO (initial DEX offering) launch. This will come at the price of ₳0.1 for 1 ICWT. We will also have a soft cap of 4.200.000 ICWT (20%) and in the end if not all the ICWT tokens are sold, the rest will be put in the treasury.
The second method is to stake your Cardano (₳) with our stake pool. This way you will not receive the ₳ staking rewards but our ICWT token in contrast to how much you have staked in our pool. This is also known as an ISO (initial stake pool offering). This will run until all 2.100.000 ICWT staking rewards are replenished.
 
Deflationary
The ICWT token will be deflationary. During the future events one will have to pay in ICWT for the NFT's (non fungible token) tickets for the entrance. So, let's say for instance the entrance fee is normally 20euro per person for an event with a capacity of 1000 people. Considering the fact that the price at that moment will be at 0.1euro ICWT. So now let's say it's sold out. This will automatically prove that after that event, 200.000 ICWT will be burned (destroyed) out of existence. Making the total max supply almost 1% smaller than before the event. So, the cheaper the ICWT tokens, the faster they burn. Making it more and more rare to obtain. We believe that this will stimulate the price upwards. And gain maximum returns for all early investors.
 
Profit model
At the beginning, all our expenses will be paid out of the public sale. If the hard cap is attained then it would be ₳840.000. We strongly trust in the Cardano eco system and their look at a decentralised future. So based on our thorough research cardano will have a more decreed value over time. When we start creating our own staking pool and let other people stake with us for ICWT, we create a revenue of 5% APY every epoch (5days) of the total ₳ in the pool. (Example: 5million ₳ in the pool at 5% APY will be ₳250000 a year). After we have made a good name for ourselves and a solid platform with multiple events a year, we will look for paid advertisers on the events. This will bring our profits in a good uptrend and let the ICWT company grow over time.
 
How will it work?
ICWT will have ambassadors that will work as a bridge between the platform and the events that are created. An ambassador will be responsible for the event and make sure everything works out. Also, with the financial part with the event proposal (phase 1) when it is elected. During the initial days we will try to organise an event every 6 months. As we start seeing progress with the ambassadors, we will continue to collaborate and organise more events in the future. ICWT will build a database for speakers with start-ups, big projects and exchanges to make the upcoming projects livelier and more zestful. We will also host an award ceremony in the future where the ICWT holders can vote and decide on the best projects.
 
What's in it for you?
You can help make the ICWT platform grow and get rewarded. How? You could start by helping in organising events. And by the end of it you would get rewarded handsomely in ICWT. Another striking factor is if your event is a complete sold-out, you can achieve double the rewards. Don't worry we will explain it through the upcoming phases. 
 
Phase 1
(The start)
An event creator loads up all ideas for the event in the ICWT platform, as a proposal. On your proposal people can comment or give advice to help you get more votes.
The information that always need to be included:
The location: where and what is the price of the location
The date
Max people allowed entrance
Spending budget (speakers, extra's costs, insurances, security, marketing...)
How much you want to receive for that event as event creator (after phase 3)
How many helpers you need that day (entrance, drink and/or food stand...)
The entrance fee calculation: (renting of the location + the spending budget + salary creator + salary helpers) / max allowed people = entrance price
Example with ICWT trading price at 1euro:
location: Brussel, expo. price for one day: 3000 euro
10 April 2022
1000
17000 euro (this makes a total of 20000euro spending)
Salary event creator: 1000 ICWT
Salary helpers: 100 ICWT each for 5 helpers
The entrance fee: 21,5 ICWT
 
Phase 2
(When your proposal is elected)
The ambassador will contact the event creator and will meet with them personally to get everything in order. He will double check everything and start contacting speakers, start-ups, exchanges and whomever interested to come and promote their crypto on the event. After we have confirmed who will come, the ambassador and the event creator will together create an event schedule for that day. Starting from the time building up the stands and podium till the end of the event. The ambassador will pay for everything needed with the ICWT company fund.
 
Phase 3
(The event)
The event creator and ambassador will be addressing the main aspects of the program that day. As they are well aware about the details of everything and are on track with everything and everyone including the helpers. They will be the first person in and last person out during that event.
 
Phase 4
(The payment)
After the completion of the event, we will evaluate the project and go further on with the payment. To intensify more correct planning and calculation of the event, we reward the creator with a couple factors to gain extra salary in ICWT:
Sold out: X2 salary
Not over you spending budget: X1.5 salary
perfectly organised event, no problems: X1.25 salary
 
Budget breakdown
We will use the $4500 to set up the site, stakepool and IDO
 
Solution for United Nations Development Program and World Bank group?
We want to give them both a exhibit booth and speaker opportunity at all ICWT events , to help connecting the communities together. 
 
Are you feeling excited?
Good! Because that's the spirit that we are looking for! If you feel the need of becoming our ambassador, social media administrator, or other skills you like to share, don't wait and contact our CEO (Stephan Tenten)

It's hammer time!
Currently there are over 70 million Youtube videos on DIY projects, but no proper way to incentivize the Makers who explain how something is made. 
Youblob is an online makerspace for collaboration and blueprint sharing around all these ideas and creating an eco-system around idea sharing back to the industry in order to create new opportunities on new levels of interaction and data sharing.
Take ownership of your idea in the open source space, allow others to create iterations from it, show the industry who you are and what awesome things you can build with their products! 
We are allowing open collaboration across all subjects, all while maintaining the high level of documentation around iterations and how something is made, along with creating incentive models on top of this to put the idea maker in the front seat of the whole solution. We even go so far that you can be incentivized by AI on what it produces in the future.
Our motto: Rapid prototyping ...made easy (even for AI)
 
So what have we done so far... almost 10 years of iterations lul
2012 - Implementation of Drupal, investigating e-commerce (first time we did this)
2013 - Distribution agreement with Sparkfun, investigating distribution chains and order handling
2014 - Investigating sales and stock handling
2015 - Investigating manufacturing
2016 - Implementation of blueprints and investigation around rapid prototyping, + migration from Drupal to Magento
2017 - Process analysis between manufacturer - distributor - sale - and Maker (missing link)
2018 - Includes analysis around physical makerspaces and other organizations and their pain points
2019 - We ran out of money and had to put everything on ice
2020 - Still no money, but I started working as Test lead for a wind turbine simulation company.
2021 - Got money, hired a Designer to rework the old MVP/POC (now it truly kicks as... it stand)
Currently pending;
Implementation and updates to the Magento 2 platform - Ongoing (also already hired)
Implementation of smart contracts - Starts in Sept. (hire imminent)
Implementation of AI prototypes - Starts in mid 2022 (hire pending)
 
Definition of success:
3 months: Implementation of the new design, along with initial smart contract functionality
6 months: Extended smart contract functionality which Adaptive Paypal payments can not handle, along with NFT on Blueprints and idea sharing functionality 
9 months: Implementation of Wolfram Mathematica integration solutions
12 months: Implementation of SingularityNET and AI functionality
 
Launch:
The platform can launch publicly after 3 months, once the new design is in place and we have the basic ledger system in place that conforms to Cardano.
 
What we need:
Designated business developer from IOG to align the solutions properly.
Designated solution architect from Wolfram Mathematica for correct data flow around AI handling.
In house developers and designers, instead of being outsourced.
 
What we can give in return:
The next industrial revolution.
 
Extra information to enlighten questions asked by Users:
Q: Which Cardano functionality/smart contracts are you planning to implement?
A: For the initial stage, the User will get their own wallet on the platform when registering.
This will be used for the incentive solutions along with NFT sales, marketplace sales and referral bonuses.
The User is also able to register a business on our platform, which will designate a separate wallet for the business/organization, to maintain different ledger systems accordingly.
Smart contracts will be handling collaboration with teams to build Blueprints together and make a fair/modular incentive solution. 
The smart contracts will also handle easy checkout, (buy from several/pay once), along with other e-commerce functionality, and we plan on bringing all this information back to the user dashboard with some fancy graphs etc to make it easy to understand how to become even more successful (what works/what needs more love)
 
Q: Why do we need funding?
A: We need to hire people to make it happen, apparently I'm the only one that have worked for free for 10 years.
Trust me, I've asked several people to come onboard, but they are to busy, and need it as a full time job or as a freelancer job.
 
Q: What are the terms of the capabilities you will have and the services you will be able to provide?
A: We enable a free platform for anyone to join and collaborate with. This also includes organizations/Makerspaces to register and handle their members and stock, to companies within manufacturing and e-commerce with their distribution networks to get a better solution, as we enable some smart backend solutions to make life easier for everyone.
In the long run, once the site is populated with Blueprints, it will also be used as a learning resource for students and alike, as we map out what every component is used for in different categories.
Q: How does this integration add value to the Cardano community
A: Global Adoption and new use cases, plus we want to share our smart contract solutions with the community and help build up a library of functionality.
Q: How does the funding your asking for break down across your ""definitions of success""?
A: The funds we are asking for, is a 6 week development sprint, and we need to ask for funding again in F7.
I've spent around 200K$ of my own money up until now on this project, and I need any help I can get.
Q: How does this relates to the challenge category and the questions it proposes?
A: Youblob supports 10 out of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
 
UNSDG 1: No poverty
The Youblob platform is free to use. If you have no money, you can still use Youblob to earn money.
It is also possible to set up your own business on Youblob to learn how it is to run a business.
 
UNSDG 4: Quality education
As more and more Blueprints are published on Youblob, we believe this will be used as a learning platform, giving free easy access to schools and their students, and enabling new ideas in the local communities on how to optimise and make things better
 
UNSDG 5: Gender equality
Youblob supports Gender Equality and the empowerment of women and girls.
Through our platform we want to change the bad social norms that exists in certain societies by promoting and helping diverse communities that includes females.
 
UNSDG 8: Decent work and economic growth
Our platform creates an easy portal into the business world.
Scaling your business or putting it on vacation mode is just one click away.
Youblob makes it easy for End Users to become part of a SMART technological platform aimed towards product handling, commerce and offering services, fully integrated with automated accounting, advanced back-end wallet functions, and scalable solutions aimed to help the end-users.
 
UNSDG 9: Industry, innovation and infrastructure
Youblob connects the Industry with the End Users, providing valuable data back to the industry thus paving the way for new innovations at a rapid speed.
Youblob wish to participate in building infrastructure such as automated production hubs around the world. Starting in undeveloped countries first.
UNSDG 10: Reduced inequalities
Developing countries needs to be given access to the correct tools for an efficient and stable collaborative effort. Youblob enables such by giving an easy way for new B2B relationships to form, along with enabling B2C and C2B solutions on the same level.
Reducing inequalities in our society, by making everyone understand they are equal as the next person might be the one that takes the product to the next level.
 
UNSDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities
The Youblob platform makes the different iterations created in the different local communities easy to share and iterate on using local materials. Thus supporting the least developed countries through technical assistance, know-how and establishing an understanding of what works best in the different regions.
 
UNSDG 12: Responsible consumption and production
Blueprints explains how Users can build upon and reuse recycled material, and will be a key factor in ensuring that the people get the relevant information and awareness for a sustainable development, reducing waste and the reuse of materials.
 
UNSDG 13: Climate action
As part of awareness-raising, impact reduction and education of the people around Climate Actions. Youblob provides a platform to strengthen the institutional work with technology transfer, development actions and individual capacity building.
 
UNSDG 17: Partnerships for the goals
Youblob enables science and technology cooperation non-excluding.
Youblob is part of enhancing global microeconomic stability.
 
Q: How can Cardano enter in global partnerships with United Nations Development Programme and World Bank Group, to leverage mass adoption? 
A: That is why we are asking for a business developer from Cardano in our proposal to join our team. We are also looking for Solution architect from Wolfram, UNESCO representative and a UNSDG representative.
 
I hope this enlightened the questions we got, and we look forward to an exiting period ahead

The project
The world is undergoing environmental changes generated by forms of production, open exploitation of nature and in expansive cycles of pollution, which have led to the transformation of industrial production systems, with a sustainable orientation (Sachs, 2015).
Social marginality and global warming are closely related to the technological field, so it is essential to create strategies that urgently address this humanitarian and environmental alert.
In Colombia there are approximately 21 million Colombians in extreme poverty (DANE monetary poverty), this scenario has been built after the pandemic. According to information from ECLAC, in Latin America and Colombia, 10 years of efforts to reduce poverty and misery have been lost; After the economic and social crisis that unleashed the pandemic, as well as the historic 6.8% drop in GDP last year.
Globally, emissions reached a record 33,143 million tons of CO2 in 2018, in Colombia they reached 74,954 kilotonnes two years ago. The government's goal is to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 20% by 2030.
In energy and industrial systems, the options considered feasible for adaptation to global warming of 1.5 ° C are water management and cooling strategies, but these are not sufficient strategies.
ALMAGUA has been established as an organization oriented towards sustainable development within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (ODS), through projects that help mitigate gas emissions and empower communities economically in favor of social, sustainable and at the same time to guarantee
an economy worthy of those who live in marginality and poverty, especially women and children.
The project is characterized by merging three important factors for interoperability, scalability and performance in exchange protocols, such as the physical, digital and financial worlds. As supports for the structuring of a platform that will contribute to sustainable human coexistence, strategic alliances, cooperation and financial competition, the constitution of investment ecosystems, the change of the energy matrix and the fulfillment of the SDGs.
 
Process
Once Cardano has available the development of smart contracts, Almagua will initiate a process together with developers and interest groups willing to support the initiative for the creation of smart contracts for the creation of a DAO in the Cardano mainnet, with voting power and a democratic system for the approval and creation of new tokens, with a platform similar to the Catalyst Idea Scale.
Almagua develops social projects of aquaponic, hydraulic and productive reforestation, so that it can provide benefits to society and that its impact is measurable.
The projects will be certified by an entity; These certificates will be uploaded to the cardano mainnet through a unique registration code such as Non-Fungible Token in the Cardano network, which can later be consulted from the DAO Almagua. In this way, other companies or corporations interested in the acquisition of carbon credits will be able to monitor the process and will be aware that through the compensation process for the acquisition of credits they will also be supporting social and environmental projects developed by the Almagua foundation in different sectors of Colombia, Latin America or the world.
Each of the projects that Almagua can be replicated in other communities, since each of these projects is based on productive reforestation, donations and recycling campaigns to carry out the correct management of resources to have a holistic and totally circular approach. .
 
Initial stage for Found 6
As a first stage, to make our project possible, it will be of great relevance to create a Pool in Cardano Mainet, to get collaborators, for each person who joins the Pool, Almagua agrees to plant a tree with the capacity to absorb CO2.
Thus, Almagua and the community will work together in favor of the native communities and the environment, on the one hand, the Pool community will have incentives in the adas and collaterally they will be supporting reforestation projects, part of the adas collected by the Cardano Pool. It will be destined to the support and maintenance of the network, in the course of this time we will be training ourselves for the development of smart contracts, at this stage Almagua commits to making the first prototype of Certified Token, and in this way we can take those initial steps to a DAO in favor of mitigation with carbon neutral credits so that in the very near future Almagua can create new Tokens with Carbon Neutral Certificate.
167 kg of CO2 is the absorption capacity of a tree per year, that is why we propose this initiative of productive reforestation and by productive we mean that they are trees that will also fulfill the function of generating resources for native communities, this is a point exit to new projects that encourage the mitigation of the carbon footprint,
By planting a tree we mitigate the impact of the energy equivalent to that necessary to keep a computer on for 1 hour and 30 minutes = 1 hour 200 Kwh TOTAL: 80.00 Kg CO2eq.
pc in 1 hour 200 Kwh TOTAL: 80.00 Kg CO2eq
And since we are talking about proof of participation, Almagua is committed to doing the entire block creation and validation system with the implementation of solar energy and equipment that does not require a lot of energy consumption or computing power. we are sure that with the implementation of a simple solar panel system, a smart meter, a rasberry pi and a server in amazon Aws we can make this initiative possible.
To make possible the sustainability of the pool, allmagua will focus its efforts on carrying out educational campaigns of cardano in favor of environmental initiatives, in social networks, educational institutions, universities and interest groups in favor of the mitigation of the carbon footprint, of In this way, people will be able to have much more knowledge of the power of cardano and will understand all the correct process from the creation of the personal wallet, the acquisition of the adas, the pools, the proof of stake philosophy and transfer processes to their personal wallet. to do the freezing or staking process.

Cardano IdeaScale - 27 Insights & 10 Projects Submitted
Budget Line Items

The Primary Objective of our Proposal.
The Cardano Blockchain needs to build an International non-profit & non-governmental organisation on a par with the biggest international organisations. This is not only for respect, this will also drive mass understanding of the industry and thereby facilitating mass adoption & use of cryptocurrencies & blockchain based services.
By building our own organisation we can participate in the projects of other organisations on an equal footing.
We should create our own global organisation targeting all of the common objectives of United Nations Development Program, World Bank Group and others, totally funded and managed with cryptocurrency. Then we will have the attention and cooperation of these entities together with mass adoption of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.
Our organisation would benefit from becoming a fully decentralised autonomus organisation (DAO), ensuring that the activities deal with real lifestyle problems articulated in plain language by the people it effects, using digital industry governance and voting models promoted by Cardano in this Catalyst experiment we will eliminate politics and bureaucracy. Our governance model should be agile & responsive, able to take action quickly and make corrective adjustments as necessary.
 
I would like to introduce you to iHEAR Trust ""Using CryptoCurrency to Solve the Planet's Problems"" A Not-for-Profit Company. iHEAR Trust was incorporated as a registered UK Non-Profit Company in 2018.
iHEAR Stands for - INTERNATIONAL - HOUSING - ECOLOGY - AFFORDABLE - RECYCLING
Why International?
In order to make effective improvements we must use joined-up-thinking. We must also re-balance the differentials between developed and developing countries in terms of access to technology, information, investment, housing and sanitation.
Why Housing?
The biggest negative effects human beings have on this planet revolve around where and how we live. Dealing with our poor recycling efforts, the throw-away society, old styles of construction amongst many other issues will have a positive impact on all aspects of our climate and ecosystem.
Why Ecology?
Operating purely for financial gain would be a big mistake and missed opportunity. Using our housing as a focus to reduce our negative impact on the planet is a natural and efficient way to address concerns about the deterioration we have created to the land, seas and sky.
Why Affordable?
Most corporations are run with one objective in mind: ever growing profits for the shareholders. Add this to the well-established fact that there is a worldwide shortage of appropriate living accommodation, it can be no surprise that the cost of housing has risen far more than the increase in household incomes. We will work to use profits, created in the developed world, to subsidise projects in the developing worlds and find innovative methods of reducing costs or introducing new affordable financing models.
Why Recycling?
There is value in our rubbish, much of it can be reprocessed & reused, even landfills can be emptied to create energy & useable materials.
It has been established there are more precious metals available in our electronic equipment than is feasibly left to mine below ground, except for a small number of organisations there is little effort to recover and reuse these rare assets.
Why CryptoCurrencies?
We will achieve our objectives by using the power of cryptocurrencies, asset tokenisation, blockchain ledgers, smart contracts, and decentralised applications. Because this will facilitate our operations with borderless financing, an international network of people, interested in our objectives, who can supply the necessary skills to bring our mission and vision to fruition.
You can Download our White Paper Below
Why Cardano?
We see the international vision of IOG & Cardano perfectly in line with our own ambitions, we believe we will benefit greatly from the way the Cardano Blockchain has been built & developed and how this 3rd generation ecosystem will facilitate interoperability with existing dApps and the new ones to come.
About Us, Team & Team Building
Since 2018, when iHEAR Trust Limited was incorporated, all of the funding, research & development of this project has been funded by and developed by me through my primary business, Carl Henry Global https://CarlHenryGlobal.com.
It is now time to build a brand-new team that will focus specifically on developing iHEAR Trust, this will include executive directors, committee leaders and members of the sub-committees that will run the projects around the world.
iHEAR Trust is born out of my 40 plus years (Since 1978) in business drawing from several of the businesses I have operated including Finance, Real Estate, Internet (since 1998), Corporate structures, Lifestyle businesses and all types of marketing.

iHEAR Trust - Projects
Who is iHEAR Trust for?
Simply, everyone and everything living on our planet earth. Our work will be guided though our focus on housing, ecology, affordability & Recycling. Our aim is to help ""join-up"" the thinking around the world so efforts are more co-ordinated.
 
iHEAR Trust - International Projects & Activities
What iHEAR Trust will do?
iHEAR Trust, a non-profit organisation will raise funding by launching a Cardano Native Token called ""iHEAR"" as soon as decentralised exchanges are created on the Cardano Blockchain (12th September?). It will be the first global non-governmental organisation entirely funded by cryptocurrency and all operations will be run on the Cardano Blockchain.
Our Token Listing: https://cardanoassets.com/bf0175e3c926ef30dd3d60ed4d374f89c1feb37b6116875f5aaf3df8
We will use the value created, by selling our token, to deepen our research, reach formal relationships with partners & innovators, build our multi-lingual international team, become an incubator for new technologies and projects that will help our planet, improve living standards internationally, support new projects, developing open-source techniques, and supplying financial & manpower resources.

United Nations Development Programme & World Bank Group Activities

The two organisations mentioned in this challenge are the United Nations Development Programme and World Bank Group, I have studied their activities in order to align our efforts & also to fill any gaps that exist. Both organisations welcome co-operation & involvement of other organisations in their projects. Here are my general findings on their primary activities:
United Nations Development Programme - https://www.undp.org/

Ending poverty & Improving Health
Helping people fulfill their potential & prosper
Reverse degradation of the planet
Manage natural resources & climate change
Promote peace & reduce violence
Develop global Partnerships to achieve the mission
Creating access to financial services.

NB: There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals but the list above is where the focus is currently.
World Bank Group - https://www.worldbank.org/

Ending poverty & promoting prosperity
Sustainable living practices
Agriculture research & support
Education for all ages & both sexes
Renewable & non-renewable energy research
Financial sector projects & study
Housing, manufacturing, tourism & trade projects
Information & communications services
Road, rail, air & water Transportation
Water, sanitation & waste management projects

The Conclusion?
The Cryptocurrency and Blockchain industry must show it is not just, playing ""money games"", we should show that we are fulfilling a Global leadership role, in things people care about and we can build an international non-profit & non-governmental organisation.
We can show how an organisation build for the benefit of people can be governed by the people who speak ordinary language and talk about properly identified problems to solve. The sustainable development goals of the United Nations do cover the ground necessary but are mere statements of the obvious, if you try to read the detail you will see it has been written by bureaucrats using complicated language that seems to aim to please the reader rather than identify core daily problems to solve.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

Formal relationship Cardano Foundation - Innovatio, allowing to generate more relationships with official regulatory/development organism.",6,"Monday, 23 August 2021 15:48",Innovatio,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Innovatio/3062346-48088,,,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


What's doing Innovatio?
Innovatio is developing a P2P Crowdfunding platform, which would allow projects within and outside the blockchain ecosystem to submit crowdfunding campaigns under different funding modalities and receive investments in fiat currency and cryptocurrencies.
The Innovatio Founder platform uses blockchain technology to solve and improve the following processes:


The investments received are managed in a disintermediated way through smart contracts, providing total transparency in the movements made


Innovatio's marketplace crowdfunding campaigns have legal and blockchain representation in parallel. Facilitating the drafting of responsibilities and commitments.


Funds raised by each campaign are distributed through milestones and decentralized voting consent among investors with meta-data.


Implementation of wallets and fiat currency payments through meta-data and APIs, facilitating a simple and practical user experience.


The Innovatio Founder project aims to be a great user experience and bridge between users who do not know the technology of Cardano and have an interest in learning and consume this.
Cardano Foundation can accompany as an advisory partner in the different phases of Innovatio necessary for the legal and regulated operation of the platform in the different jurisdictions with legal and technical advice. (EU, USA, Canada, Africa, etc).
In this way, in these processes, Cardano Foundation can generate relationships with organizations such as the FSA, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, development agencies, social and educational projects, state programs, etc.
 
How can Innovatio and Cardano Foundation help each other?
1. In the legal implementation of the Smart Contracts platform, Cardano Foundation can generate legal frameworks and objectives to improve the adoption of Smart Contracts in the financial market.
2. Use the practical example of The Innovatio Founder to expand the adoption of this technology in its different areas. (Smart Contrat, Meta-Data, Digital Identity, Security, etc).
3. Extension of collaborative network with government agencies around the world generating greater adoption and implementation with governmental and regulatory agreements.
 
How we will achieve this proposal?
Innovatio has the legal advice of a law firm specialized in the implementation of blockchain in financial services such as LimeChain and LimeLegal.
In this way, we have ensured that we know the licenses and regulations necessary to operate in the European Union market with the implementation of Smart Contracts and meta-data.
These firms have specialized lawyers in the field throughout the world, being a high-value partner in the expansion of the platform's service to other jurisdictions.
 
What KPIs measure success?
1) Agreements for the implementation of blockchain technology in services provided by state or provincial governments.
2) Creating legal frameworks in conjunction with government agencies for the adoption of blockchain technology.
3) Agreements with official development and education organisms for the implementation and development of blockchain technology.
 
Breakdown Budget
Necessary licenses to operate the Crowdfunding platform with blockchain technology in the European market: $20.000

WottleNFT aims to align the values of Cardano to SDGs by having the highest bidder choose the SDG and Social Enterprise that they support.",33,"Sunday, 22 August 2021 12:46",wottlenft,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/wottlenft/3073088-48088,Tan Kang Liang,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Tan-Kang-Liang/3101221-48088,16725,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano has branded itself to be a sustainable, scalable and interoperable blockchain. To continue down this path of being the ""most environmentally sustainable"" cryptocurrency, Cardano should further align its values and goals to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). UN has 169 associated targets and over 5000 active actions with various sectors to build a sustainable future. UN has set a 2030 Agenda, called Catalyst 2030, that has over 39,000 full-time employees in 71 countries serving over 180 countries and has reached over 4 billion people worldwide. By aligning Cardano's values with the SDGs, Cardano will be able to connect with a vast number of corporations that are actively supporting SDGs which can in turn increase mass adoption rate towards Cardano. To bring Cardano's vision of success a reality, WottleNFT aims to do just that.
WottleNFT strives to be the first Sustainable NFT Auction Site that aims to build an interconnected ecosystem between Cardano NFTs and Social Enterprises. The reason why Cardano should work with Social Enterprises is because they are the driving forces behind SDGs. In 2020, there are more than 600 member institutions and 900 individuals working in more than 190 countries that are covering all 17 UN SDGs. The impact of collaborations with social enterprises is also shifting philanthropies by breaking down traditional silos that are interconnected, such as education, health or nutrition. If Cardano were to assist Social Enterprises worldwide, it can not only accelerate UN's progress towards achieving the 2030 SDGs goals, but will also be able to change the hearts and minds of funders to a more holistic and systemic approach towards fundings.
Tim Hanstad, a former social entrepreneur and current CEO of the philanthropic Chandler Foundation shares that ""You can't effectively educate a systemically malnourished child, and by tapping into networks such as Catalyst 2030, philanthropic organisations can more effectively evaluate need and apply their respective funding strategies to the problem as a whole. This way of working is not without its challenges, but we are seeing this is increasingly accepted as the way to go in the future.""
Social Entrepreneurs are fuelled by a sense of urgency and a passion to deliver an impact. There is only have nine years left to achieve the SDGs. Only by working together can we stand a chance of making a difference to the lives that matters most.
How does WottleNFT work?
The business model of WottleNFT works similar to that of a social enterprise, with a twist. On top of royalties, a portion of the auction fees that WottleNFT collects, are channeled towards social enterprises. After an NFT auction has ended, the highest bidder will get to choose one of the 17 SDG goal that he/she supports. Afterwhich, he/she will choose a social enterprise that supports that underlying SDG goal. Once chosen, the smart contract will automate the auction transaction and channels the fees towards the chosen social enterprise. Since these donations came from the highest bidder, his/her efforts will not go unnoticed. Each profile on WottleNFT will have a transparent track-record of his/her contributions to Social Enterprises worldwide. Doing so, WottleNFT will not just be an ordinary NFT Auction Site, but an interoperable gateway to connect Social Enterprises with the Cardano Community.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Objective and solution
The objective of the challenge is to enter into global partnerships with UNDP and the world bank group in 3-6 months and with developing local community centers in 130 countries. With such a big objective the budget of the challenges is limited to 30,000 so we suggest a strategy that will make it easier to match between catalyst ecosystem and the global organizations. It will then be easier & faster to find the best partnership opportunities and the local hubs will be developed through those partnerships utilizing already available hubs.
Cardano's mission and the strong values of the community come hand in hand with SDG objectives. Many of Cardano's projects/proposals could lead to collaboration opportunities with UNDP, the World Bank, and many other organizations.
More info about SDGs could be found here: https://sdgs.un.org/goals
 
The solution is therefore to build a mechanism to be able to easily identify and rate the most suitable projects on Cardano to facilitate third-party collaborations. Catalyst team or partners receiving access to such database will be able to easily search and select relevant proposals/projects for the potential partnerships.
GDP rating will also be a great tool for the community and voters aiming to support projects which solve SDG-related issues. Proposal owners will be exposed more to the SDG model and will consider the impact of the proposal starting from day 1.
 
Workflow process:
1. Evaluation stage: week 0 - week 4
Go through all fund 6 winning proposals and analyze: how many proposals have impact objectives or impact implications, what SDGs they are solving, how scalable the impact could be, what are the impact measurement used, how the impact could be recorded and reported.
The methodology will be to review all the proposals and have discussions with the teams where relevant.
2. Analysis stage: week 4 - week 6
Put together the information, analyze it and present the results
The recommended mechanism will include the following areas
    A. How to best tag proposals/projects with relevant SDGs including the sub-levels of each SDG
    B. How to integrate quantitative measurements as part of the project/proposal. This will be directly connected to an ongoing impact reporting requirement during the various stages of the project.
   C. Mechanism for rating proposals from 1-5, 5 being high impact and while taking into account the impact areas, potential scale, and how the impact is being measured and reported.
For this proposal, the key focus is on adding the SDG to the proposal process and analyzing the proposals so we can focus on partnerships. We will also suggest a mechanism to measure & register impact and rate proposals' impact accordingly. Which can then be developed in the next phase.
 
3. Integration to IdeaScale: week 6 - 10
Communication with IdeaScale and catalyst teams to integrate the SDG into the proposal process and creating the database and filters to search proposals.
Finetune the key features/ to be included in the process.
The first database will include the proposals from fund 6. 
 
4. Promotion and partnerships: Week 8 - Week 12
Once we have the analysis of the proposals we could share targeted proposals with multiple relevant organizations based on the SDGs and location. We will prepare marketing materials for an attractive communication. The team has a good network and will
We will aim to partner with the SDG LAB Geneva https://www.sdglab.ch/ where we have contacts and it could be a good initial entry to more partnerships. Another potential partner will be www.seedstars.com that also has local hubs in developing countries which could be used to promote Cardano and as a source for new proposals coming from developing countries.
Based on the analysis of the database we can evaluate PR and social media activities
During this phase, we will also map global organizations and their international hubs locations
 
Key metrics
# of proposals that match SDG and per segment of SDG
# Partnership with SDG Lab and Seedstars
# of lead generation for partnerships with organizations including the potential scale to their local hubs
At the end of the 12-week process, Cardano will be able to use a framework model for partnerships between the Catalyst ecosystem and international organizations.
Based on the learning and discussions, the proposal team will also offer the next steps of integration of SDGs into the Cardano ecosystem to facilitate more partnerships and local hubs to support the goal of Cardano ""making the world work better for all"".
Another important metric to follow is how SDG has become of growing importance in the Cardano community and support other activities.

The proposal team goal is to make social & environmental sustainability a strong part of the Cardano community and Ecosystem. The team is involved in multiple impact activities and is also part of Grow Cardano Sustainability Telegram group.
 
Budget
The proposal's time scope is 12 weeks where we will have a budget of $2,500 per month for the various tasks which will be about 50% position based on European modest salary. However, we will dedicate our best efforts and time needed to make this proposal a success. Here are some detailed budget per task
Evolution stage $2,500
Analysis stage $1,000
Integration to ideascale $1,000
Promotion activities $3,500
Total budget $7,500
 
Challenges
There will be challenges on the way to success, here are some:
Challenge 1 - integration to IdeaScale
The integration should be fairly simple, but integrating with a third party always holds some risk as not all depend on your side. We count on Catalyst to support us in this process once the community approves the proposal.
 
Challenge 2 - budget and ongoing activities
The budget of the overall challenge is $30,000, so we looked at the most cost-effective way to reach the challenge objectives. There might be a need for additional resources to form partnerships with external organizations and develop additional tools.
 
Challenge 3 - limited of SDG proposals
The results of the analysis phase might reflect that only a limited number of proposals are actually SDG-related (i.e. less than 10%) which could impact potential partnerships opportunities. It will be a very important measurement to understand and suggest actions accordingly. 
 
Challenge 4 - measurement and verification
When we talk about impact, measurements and verification are very important but also very challenging. There might not be a simple solution and we will aim to suggest a base that could be developed ongoing.
 
Summary
SDG is the common language today among UN development programs, the world bank group, and other global organizations. Integrating SDGs into the proposal ecosystem and Cardano ecosystem in general is therefore highly important in order to facilitate partnerships. The plan is feasible and the team is dedicated to integrating more social and environmental impact mechanisms into the Cardano ecosystem.
Thank you for taking the time to evaluate the proposal. We welcome any feedback, questions, and suggestions. We also welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the success of the proposal. We appreciate the CA, VCA, and voter's time and attention.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The plan is, each day I write and publish pages, I offer them to supporters who pledge their Ada to the stake pool (Books4Blocks is a name idea), where the literature is offered for free to stake pool supporters.
These pages address current issues -- and focus primarily on self-liberation, and healing of the soul. What's needed daily.
Books get written, blocks get saturated, a gallery of NFT art is generated exclusive to Cardano Net, and pages are offered daily. All dedicated to the Mainnnet nodes we saturate as a community.
In effect we build the New Library of Alexandria that will never be burned down. And it shall contain great wisdom.
If folks want to purchase either full books or pages individually, I am not opposed to auctions starting at 1 ADA. And so we get an auctions system and gallery going for the sale of NFTs. Any pages I sell that sell for more than 10 Ada I shall by request mail and ship the original typewritten pages won, so members of the community can own the original. Not the rights to copyright work, mind you, but the rights to own the original digital print as well as the physical page. As an original art piece. And that is how I will receive compensation for my service. The rest of the work I provide for free. And it's valuable.
My requested funds are to recover the costs of the scanning software I use which is Kofax OmniPage ($499) and my digital scanner ($100). I am fine with access to the gallery being managed by community vote. This will require collaborative effort. That's what I'm asking for more than anything here. I am not a programmer. It seems to be perceived as a weakness, and a gatekeeper.  I offer a valuable, alternative perspective. I am a writer who believes in Cardano enough to bring several friends and family aboard the train. I want to share my writing, music and film with this community. I want to collaborate with other creatives who are willing to take a leap of faith with me. There is no outlet for writers, musicians or filmmakers from what I can see through Cardano. There is no forum. So tell me what I have to do to create a hub for readers, filmmakers, musicians, writers and poets.
Without this, there is a major element missing and this creative element can and will drive the expansion of the Cardano community. I want in. I don't know how else to ask for it. I've been asking for help with this for months. Written Charles directly. Literature is life. Yet no one is reading. Perhaps you want audiobooks? No problem, I can do that too.
If there was no written word, there would be no lambda calculus and that means there would be no programming languages. No Cardano. No blockchain. No Ada Lovelace writing the first programming code. No civilization.
I'm asking for you to support a dying craft by immortalizing it. That's what this community is about. That's what I believe. Now someone please be courageous and come forward and work with me. Someone who can handle the backend and turn a jpeg into an NFT. For starters. And then an .mp3. And then a .mp4. Then pdf and word docs. All NFTs. That's what the artists need.
We must start building a compendium of artistic expression to fuel our hearts and souls and keep us going. And celebrate it.
If I'm missing where this forum exists where folks are cranking out NFTs and selling them like hotcakes to eager artist supporters, I want in. But I want it to be as easy as maintaining a Substack blog. Something turn-key where creatives can write, compose, create, and post as NFT. No more run arounds, Artists need to get involved if you want fuel.
The first alt-coin to do this is going to have a head start on the rest.
Jeff Bezos was one of the first, and most determined to accomplish this with books on the Internet. He believed. Now someone must take the lead with this on blockchain. I'll supply a ton of literature to get us started. Let's lay the foundation.

Glossary
[Cooperativa] is understood as a decentralized model where membership is open and voluntary; control is executed by P2P democratic processes; benefits are shared through income, participation; education, autonomy and independence; balancing the power of members for a strong commitment taken towards the community.
[Local] means a territory composed of both digital and physical resources where nearby people interact according to specific needs and expectations that cannot be reduced to a global framework. Physical spaces are shared by multiple people identified by different communities.
[Cooperativa Local] was founded as a collaborative intention to serve various creative and entrepreneurial communities in Chile, Latin America and beyond; through a Hub website for Local NFTs, as well as P2P educational phygital instances that support the local adoption of various uses for NFTs and DAO.
[DAOOH] is an acronym we academically propose for ""Decentralized and Autonomous Organizations through Out-of-Home digital displays"". A year from now, into Cardano's era of Basho (scaling) and together with you (other F6 projects).. Cooperativa Local will integrate DAO capability to both its website for minting diverse local NFTs and its OOH infrastructure: 50 recycled digital displays, installed by local communities at public spaces of Chile... Through which they will be able to broadcast their multiple NFT contents and uses; empowering local people by enhancing their access to Cardano, expression, commerce, education and coordination towards the local common good.
 
Our first invitation to Cardano Community and every F6 project:
The following 4th of September, you are formally invited to participate on Chile's first public NFT & DAOOH event, where Cooperativa Local will be leading educative activities to lead the adoption of NFT contents and uses; as well as broadcasting local NFTs to the public.
Update: we hosted 120 guests; 100 of which participated passively on our intervention, while 40 did it actively (by interacting with the UX or asking questions. By the end, 20 registered as collaborators of Cooperativa Local and will be available for leading activation efforts on their localities. 10 already created their first NFTs. Have a look at these and the whole live experience on our (alpha) website https://cooperativalocal.org/
Send us a message if you'd be interested to participate on further events; to share (or test) your proposal with chilean citizens!
 
Problem
Nowadays, NFTs are being validated in global markets. In Cardano's Blockchains they are more accessible than Ethereum's, however, the adoption of everyday applications face -at least- the same exposition and advertising barriers as other traditional contents. Moreover, NFT and Blockchain technologies requiere knowledgeof concepts, interfaces, cryptocurrencies and uses that can be specific for each individual.
Because of this, the learning curves are particularly steep in Chile and Latin America, resulting in a very slow adoption in the Region. We calculate that less than 200 chileans have minted NFTs.
In terms of advertising costs for chileans; here, 75% of small and medium businesses depend on the local influx of customers; their target audience. However, only 17% can afford digital or outdoor advertising (OOH); this means that more than 80% close before functioning 3 years. Yearly losses exceed $500 million dollars.
The reason for the high cost of promoting in a locality is that advertising markets are overly-concentrated by corporations and social networks (73% portion) that do not mind whether who pays its advertising service is an international company (non-local) or a small self-managed local initiative; advertising and exposition market prices are unattainable for the vast majority of world's society.
This dynamic affects in an even worse manner local initiatives that do have a proven positive impact on the quality of life of communities and their people, such as artistic, cultural, health, recreational, educational, democratic, etc. Thus, losses are difficult to quantify and invaluable in terms of access to a better quality of life provided by diverse local initiatives.
 
Solution
Our model recognizes that within each locality there are different issues and inspirations, which NFTs can serve in different appropriate ways. These differences do not only exist within each locality, but also between different localities. In the same way, each particular use for NFTs implies distinguible activation strategies at each location.
Taking into consideration that an important part of the learning curve lies in the difficulty to conceptualize the technology and its daily applications; the education and visualization of practical uses is a vital part of the average citizen adoption process.
Thus; altogether we will:
(A) Frequently execute physical and digital participative events; where -in coordination with local collectives throughout Chile- educating about NFT uses and hows; activating our country from within its localities.
(B) Launch a Hub website for Local NFTs where people can promote their NFTs -already published on diverse NFT infrastructures, such as Cardano's- and learn about more of its uses. Letting users to sort the NFTs by territory and community, as well as an interactive map of the territory that displays NFTs, activators, creators, collectors, communities and businesses. 
Them, altogether, will share participative functionalities such as voting initiatives and commenting: enabling a more meaningful development of the local NFT ecosystems and wider variety of inspirations around which to co-create collectively; initiating DAO community-testing. Alpha version: https://cooperativalocal.org/
(C) Broadcast these NFT contents (and uses) to physical localities in which we coordinate educative events. These instances will progressively be executed at emblematic physical public venues, where we aim to install permanent digital displays (OOH) for exclusive NFT contents from the Local people, businesses, communities and creators. It has been demonstrated that common spaces such as the main streets serve identity purposes that are broader than 'art'; thus, uses of NFT will sprout intensively in these local-focused contexts where NFTs are tangible and eloquent to the surrounding identities and contingency. Promoting regeneration, tourism and well being that could be valuable for citizens and authorities.
The installation of OOH will start with the use of recycled TVs and monitors and will also serve as educational and activation totems for local uses of NFTs and ADA; while also promoting the other F6 proposals under developing. Yes, we are together on this.
(D) Provide collaboration, testing, activation and consultancy services to NFT projects and companies willing to learn from the chilean market; which can be interpreted as representative to the rest of Latin America and countries with slow adoption of ADA, NFT and Blockchain.
 
Funding and expenses: Our Cooperative model let us to collaborate and gain multiple high-qualified capabilities for our roadmap, in low-cost fashion. The $14.000 F6 funds we are requesting will only be used -over 9 months- to:
(1) Support the coordination and execution of 88 physical -and digital- activities at chilean localities, which will emancipate Cardano and NFT knowledge of use. As well as the installing costs for our OOH (88 recycled TVs) infrastructure.
(2) Pay certified guidance for our team of developers into the path of gaining the following blockchain capabilities: IPFS, NFT (minting and listing) and DAO (specifically: community governance and democratic curation of contents to broadcast through our DAOOH displays at public spaces).
(3) $500 per each one of the 9 months, to insure the project stability, liable to unexpected situations of urgency.
Funding needed for further developments and capabilities will be raised from our service earnings and local co-funding, both from individuals, communities and local governments (without rights)
 
Roadmap
First Phase (September - December, 2021): $ 3.500
We publicly launched our website on September 4th: a digital infrastructure where chileans -sorted by locality and community- are be able to collaborate, learn, promote their NFTs and gain tools to become an activator for their surrounding peers and territory.
In that day -as in the following 3 months- Cooperativa Local lead (together with cultural and entrepreneurial communities of Chile) a physical-digital event to promote the knowledge, minting and uses of NFTs.. what may be the first public NFT broadcast at Chile.
On these first 3 months, the 4 major cities of Chile will welcome 8 physical events and 16 online activities; aiming to achieve 150 direct activations (users who mint an NFT on ADA) and 100 P2P (guided by their peers members of Cooperativa Local, using educative resources we will publicly share). On each of the 8 corporeal activities, the NFT contents will be broadcasted using OOH.
By the time we accomplish this period, Cooperativa Local website will be already displaying 300 NFTs minted exclusively on Chile, using diverse providers such as www.artano.io (when it's publicly launched) or hicetnunc.xyz. Both of these would be chosen because of their low fees.
Also, we aim to collaborate with at least 3 F6 projects in testing and activation campaigns. This way, we will continue developing a standard methodology to provide adoption-services for other NFT projects, that would be paid in the future.
 
Second Phase (January - April, 2022): $5,500 + Local Government Funding I
Having defined -on the latter phase- the foundations for our 'Activation strategy for Local NFT uses and contents' (capable of adapting to different territorial needs and collectives), in the next following 3 months we will target to replicate activities in each one of the 16 Regional capitals of Chile. Reaching 500 direct activations and 500 P2P.
For this phase, broadcastings of NFTs uses and contents will continue to happen to the different events. At least 8 will be in public spaces and 4 become permanently installed. The latter will require we to gain a new functionality on our website, where participants would be able to vote which contents they prefer to promote publicly to these places; in real time. This will serve as a test for practical uses of DAO functionalities in public chilean territory: DAOOH.
By the time we accomplish this period, Cooperativa Local website will be already displaying 1.000 NFTs minted exclusively on chilean localities.
At the end of this second phase, we aim to hit the milestone of having provided services (testing, consulting and activation campaigns) to 5 projects developing on this Catalyst F6; ending up with our first paid consultancy, testing and activation service for an  NFT business willing to execute successful activation campaigns on Chile or other similar countries, such as Latin America.
 
Third Phase (May - August, 2022): $5.000 + Our Services Income+ Local Government Funding II
For this phase; we expect to accelerate our activation rate, as the local NFT ecosystem would have been already enhancedenough to concentrate on the P2P activation campaigns.
Thus, we will lead local physical-digital events -coordinated with collectives from these localities- on the least adopting regions of Chile. In sum, 32 events would have occurred and 88 public spaces will celebrate their first permanent OOH installation for local promotion and adoption of NFTs contents and uses. We appeal to have reached 1.000 direct activations, 3,000 P2P andpromote at least 2.000 chilean NFTs in our website Hub.
Cooperativa Local would need to provide paid consultancy and activation services to 3 NFT companies, and to attain the final milestone of the third phase, will publicly launch our Cooperative NFT model at another Latin American country; ideally, the one with the least developed NFT ecosystem: experience that will enhance a path towards Africa as a potential region of great impact.
 
Fourth Fase (September +, 2022): Our Service Incomes + Local Government Funding III
A year into the path of Cooperativa Local: activated users, collectives, businesses and the Cardano/F6 Community -from Chile and the other recently-activated Latin American countries- will altogether celebrate the launch of a NFT Marketplace for Local minting, uses and contents.
The platform will allow that NFT contents and its discovery is differentiated by locality, community and type of user: either it is a person, a collective, a NFT company or a local participative initiative.
The latter infrastructure would require DAO and NFT-Social Tokenization, through which locals will be able to valuate the  contents; dynamic that will organically define which NFTs should be broadcasted to the public spaces of each activated locality.This DAOOOH milestone will allow Cooperativa Local to offer a broader democratization of the development process of any locality.
The possibilities after gaining the infrastructure cited could also serve to provide wellbeing phygital platforming for communities that share public and private spaces such as parks, institutions, avenues, touristic places, public transport, cultural centers, stadium, schools, neighbourhoods.. possibilities that would be greatly valued for them and the public and private authorities that control those spaces, but that find themselves on a need to regenerate their relationship with their fellow citizens in meaningful ways.
These new NFT opportunities will animate the global paradigm of which contents people use NFTs for, evolving from 'art' to social interaction, coordination and expression in general: opening a path for migrating Massive Social Media Corporations.
The path of Cooperativa Local aims to empower anywhere communities and everyday citizens while emancipating -together with Cardano- the democratization of societies' expression and collectively chosen paths to approach past, present and future.

The Proposal - International Legal Directory & Education Platform
I am proposing to create an international opensource online platform and educational framework for the legal industry to access the information they need to know and to provide legalised and verified education in all of the international jurisdictions. This platform would offer a publicly available directory of legal professionals around the world who understand and can advise on the digital industry.
The transactions would be focused on the Cardano Blockchain using ADA NFTs, the project will be sustained by launching a Cardano Native Token called ""CHG"":

Legal opinions, papers, education
In my opinion the only way that NFTs will become mainstream and accepted by the man in the street is when international legal professionals fully understand how a Cardano blockchain works and how assets held in NFTs have the possibility of establishing the history and ownership of any type of asset, digital or physical.
Currently the use of NFTs is open to all and is a permission-less facility, and up to now has been the domain mainly of digital assets, digital ownership has been borne out of tokens earned in computer games, these were used to buy various digital belongings, tools & weapons.
The legal profession now needs to look at the immutable possibilities for establishing ownership and transferring ownership of tangible assets in the real-world.
Perhaps the best way of transmitting information to the legal profession will be to have legal professionals involved in creating & curating legal opinions, white papers, educational content online and reporting on real transactions that have been completed.
Below I have outlined an overview of the key aspects of NFTs and the blockchain the legal industry needs to understand, there will no doubt be additional refinements to this but as I have said my role within this project is to create an initial framework and online platform.
The objective would be that each countries legal professionals would import information from their particular jurisdiction in an open-sourced manner and the information would be built up as a decentralised legal digital guidance.
The international nature of ownership via non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
One of the biggest benefits of NFTs is that the system is standardised on an international basis meaning that once a countries legal profession understand the applications, particularly in their own jurisdiction, the legal registration of assets would be on an international blockchain that can be accessed all around the world.
Once any type of assets is established in an NFT and registered on the Cardano blockchain owners are then able to transfer ownership in return for a suitable value virtually instantaneously anywhere in the world.
If the asset is being purchased by a digital currency or token a smart contract can be created to establish a trust less transfer of the asset and payment.
The benefits of immutable nature of ownership of NFTs on the Cardano Blockchain.
A key aspect of an NFT held on a blockchain is that once the history of the asset has been established on the blockchain and within the NFT, it cannot be changed. This is not the case with traditional paper-based systems where documents can be edited, forged or replaced.
Of course, paper based systems will not disappear overnight and can run in parallel with the digital system until everyone becomes more comfortable with it.
A Framework for Education & Awareness
Here is a brief introduction to some of the key areas that need to be clarified legally and guidance generated for the legal professions use.
Established ownership & borderless transfer of ownership of real property.
The foundation of this proposal will be to have the worlds legal professions accept the premise that ownership and transfer of assets can be legally and safely completed using the Cardano blockchain and NFTs.
Once this is achieved, we simply need to translate that understanding into specific use cases which again I have briefly outlined below.
Land and real estate ownership.
It is possible that land and buildings can be registered in NFTs as separate items, particularly in the case of site modular construction.
There is also the possibility of creating land registry's where none exist currently, or the current system is very inefficient.
As with other assets, outlined below, one of the benefits of NFTs that must be highlighted is that the NFT can change hands and the underlying asset does not necessarily need any adjustments or re-registration.
Another benefit worth repeating is that the transactions could happen very quickly using an NFT on a blockchain, also these can be borderless transactions. there will be legal issues such as taxation liabilities, but these would be beyond my capabilities in this proposal.
Ownership in the supply chain.
Most supply chains use various digital techniques, such as bar codes and QR codes, to track items being delivered. Adding NFTs and blockchain technologies would allow very smooth and efficient tracking internationally while cutting down on potential fraud and theft.
It would also be possible to track the complete history of manufactured goods from the source of raw materials right the way through to the eventual owner.
Maritime ownership.
There is clearly an opportunity to create a digital maritime register of ships, yachts and boats.
Vehicle ownership.
If vehicles are put onto the blockchain one of the biggest benefits is that the record would be truly international, this would be of great assistance in the case of the luxury car trade where vehicles are often sold across borders.
Physical Art Ownership.
This is one area where NFTs are actually gaining traction, I think because digital art is already an accepted asset class for the sale of NFTs, it has spilled over into the physical art world.
Jewellery, clothing, accessories
Quite often when buying luxury on expensive items there is no ""proof of ownership"" incorporated into the item, this is one area where for the first-time portable luxury items can have the facility added where the ownership is provable.
The asset can be identified in various ways including photographic, the initial purchase receipt with ownership would be put into an NFT, if the asset is sold in an aftermarket, then the NFT can be then updated.
Intellectual property, copyright & patent ownership.
Again, this is a case of setting up a parallel system that would be digital in nature and impossible to change the history while making the ownership information available publicly.
Fractional ownership within NFTs
There are a number of situations or scenarios where a physical asset needs to be owned by several parties, it would for instance be able to bequeath an asset in a will to be held in the ownership of several people.
Another situation would be investing in real estate by a group of people who could not individually afford to be part of the transaction.
An example of fractional fund raising could be a museum allowing partial ownership of its assets in order to raise funds to buy new exhibits, of course this would be a case off partial ownership without actual possession of the asset.
NFTs as an investment without possession.
To expand on this particular situation, there may be benefits generated by the separation of ownership and possession of the asset for structuring purposes.
These scenarios, and more, would no doubt be explored and expanded upon by the legal professionals who would no doubt innovate overtime expanding the uses of NFTs and the blockchain technology.
The missing link
The missing link between the physical assets and its digital life in a database or on a blockchain is one of the startling points of interest. Solving this is part of this proposal.
The answer is to create smart digital tags, a small tamper-proof electronic tag can be attached to an asset. Different types of tags will be developed to suit different types of assets, these tags can be build into the asset its self during manufacturing.
The tag can be a simple chip recording the details of the NFT, or, be made ""smart"" with the addition of transmitting capabilities for example. Assets can be connected with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that would be able to connect to a blockchain via the internet.
When the tag is attached to the asset and the piece has been registered to the Cardano blockchain, the physical-NFT link is in effect.
The tag's history cannot be changed but can be updated in the case of a transfer of ownership, or recycling for example.
As mentioned, the tag would be made tamper-proof, destroying the tag if removed. Another incentive not to remove the tag is that the value held in the NFT history would be lost and the value reduced.
Thank you for reading our proposal, looking forward to responding to any queries.
Best wishes,
Carl Henry

Funds will be used over the next 6-12 months to create and test a platform capable of performing required functions in an efficient, secure, user friendly manor. 
 
Approximately 500,000 mortgage applications are completed each year in the UK alone, predominantly millennials and will become Gen-Z over the coming years. This target audience is crucial in the adoption of blockchain infrastructure and values will align with the platforms function as it has become increasing harder for young generations to become homeowners. 
 
The function is to allow for people biggest asset they purchase in life, to becoming income generating monthly rather than waiting for appreciation over years and only accessing that increase upon sale of asset. This allows customers to pay stake their mortgage equity and receive monthly reward for doing so, which can be compounded into their mortgage effectively creating full ownership off assets quicker than traditional methods.

Leveraging NFTs and gamifying it as well as cooperating with real world environmental projects to reverse much of the damages done",15,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:23",adatreeproject,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/adatreeproject/3100586-48088,Joshua Sharp,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Joshua-Sharp/3099496-48088,20000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Vision
Our mission is to utilize Cardano's eco-friendly technology to push back the damages proof of work blockchain techs have caused.
We plan to make a real difference by directing community funds raised into environmental projects. We want to reflect an action an user takes in this 'game' to directly plant a tree in the real world.
We also believe that a project which highlights the environmental benefits of the Cardano technology, through an engaging NFT game will help bring more users to the ecosystem.
 
The game
A farmville-esque game, users will be able to buy saplings and land to grow their trees. In the user's land, they will be able to design their garden to their liking.
The trees will grow based on real-world time but sped up by a multiplier. Each tree will grow and evolve to different stages - each stage having a randomized look with the original genesis trees bought by early supporters having unique looks to the rest.
Grown trees can be ""trimmed"" to obtain an offspring sapling (iterating the generation) which can be sold or planted again.
 
Charity
We plan to cooperate with environmental and sustainability projects so that when certain actions occur in game, it'll have direct impact with the real world.
E.g. We pledge to plant a tree per sapling created in game.
We sincerely hope to offset as much of the carbon emitted by previous blockchain technologies.
 
User incentives
Wallets in the cryptocurrency world can be traced back and reviewed in a way in which the damages done by a wallet can be calculated.
There are many corporations and individuals who have the desire to be viewed in a positive light. We can leverage this by creating a leaderboard system on our platform, which allows people to visibly see rankings of individuals who have contributed to repairing the planet.
This will create competition and interest which can keep the community engaged and interested.
Trees will need to be looked after periodically. We will have a caretaker functionality that allows anyone to tend to somebody else's trees in exchange for payment, using a trustless system.
 
Milestone 1 → 3 months (October launch)
Build website landing page
Build smart contract for minting plants and land
Build infrastructure for the game
Create artwork for genesis trees and land
Open limited pre minting for trees and land
 
Milestone 2 → 6 months
Build 2D game for managing farm of trees and land
Begin marketing and collaboration with charity organisations
Create artwork for next generation of trees
 
Milestone 3 → 9 months
Open minting and release game
Foster community interest
 
Milestone 4 → 12 months +
Create additional isometric map of the game
Create a caretaker platform for player interaction between farms
 
Funding breakdown
Development Cost = 50%
Marketing Cost = 15%
Growth/Adoption Plan cost = 10%
Artwork design =10%
Partnering with environmental projects = 15%
Requested funds in USD 20,000
The above funding breakdown indicates the costs of getting the project through to the third milestone. Once the major features are developed, and the tree and land artwork has been created, the distribution of the funding will be shifted to focus on growing our community and growing relationships with third party environmental projects.

An ecosystem of devs and players governed by smart contracts.
The player can buy coins bound to the game when they achieve certain levels.",1,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 12:14",liboshen,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/liboshen/3094649-48088,,,60000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


(First, to keep things simple at the beginning, let's limit the scope of the games to single player puzzle games.)
An ecosystem of game developers and players governed by smart contracts:

Games are published by developers and free to play.
The player can buy coins bound to the game when they achieve certain levels in the game. Some portion of the fund will go to the developers address as the profit of their game. The coin is NFT, because it's non-fungible between different games. When a game sells more its coins, the coin price will go up.
Each player (i.e. an address) will have a ""networth"", which is the NFTs it owns at current price. The ""networth"" can be seen as a symbol of status which you can earn in a fair competition: if you have good taste in games or really good at solving puzzles then you can get high ""networth"" with paying little actual money.
Finally we can have a shop of artworks for players to spend their ""networth"" to strengthen their attachment to the ecosystem.

 
In more details:

The price a player will need to pay is based on the popularity and their performance in the game. The more popular when they buy it, the higher the price. The better they perform in the game the lower the price. If you buy a game before it goes viral, or you are super good at it, you can pay a much lower price than others.
People cannot cheat, because they need to prove they solve the puzzle (verified on chain) to get a better price.
We can use some incentive engineering to prevent people or bots from repeatedly submitting trying to manipulate the price.

 
Success metrics:
3 months: A working proof of concept
6 months: Launch the first version MVP
12 months: Have 100 games published, and 10000 users
 
Budget breakdown:
(This is very rough and subject to change when further into the current infrastructure)
* Full time on-chain and backend development 6 month: 30000 USD
* Frontend development 3 month: 10000 USD
* Demo games and assets preparation: 10000 USD
* Designer: 10000 USD

Decentralized Investment.
NFTs could be minted as a deed or proof of ownership of a particular realworld asset. The NFT itself and/or a smart contract could be drawn up allowing for the NFTs fractionalization. This would introduce parameters such as a potential hardcap on the number of fractions available, what portion of value returns to the NFT deed holder on resale, etc.
In the case of businesses, for example, investment could be realised in a variety of ways, but functionally it would be similar to DeFi. Investors do their own research on potential investments, add liquidity (for the NFT holding business) to the respective pool and in return receive pool tokens / child NFTs and percentage ownership of the pool. This would grant the token holder a liquid asset that earns yield on transaction fees from secondary trading, etc, in proportion to their total ownership of the pool with the potential for appreciation over time.
Business NFT holders could tap into the liquity provided by these investors in a secure and transparent way with checks and balances like collatorization to fund growth or maintain the health of their business. 
Funds would be used to explore proof of concept over a 3-6 month time frame.

Summary
https://www.cornucopias.io
Cornucopias 'The Island' is a blockchain based play-to-earn, build-to-earn game where players own characters, land and other NFT (non-fungible tokens) based assets that have real-world value, all hosted in a fun and expanding metaverse (a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users).  It was inspired from Charles Hoskinson's video - ""The Island, The Ocean and the Pond"".
'The Island' is split into a number of themed zones such as the 'Wild⋆West' zone, 'Farm Life' zone, 'Age of The Samurai' zone, etc where people of all ages can play a series of mini-games, getting lost in the play-to-earn ecosystem where they can earn real-world value as they explore and build in our safe and secure world.
The more creative players can design their own items such as coffee tables, beds and other household furnishings which can then be minted into an 'Island Blueprint' that other players can then buy, gather the materials, and then craft in-game into a brand new NFT. Once created, the crafter can play with the items in their virtual dwelling or sell them onto other players to enjoy or sell on again.
'The Island' combines gaming with real-world commerce and gives opportunities for traditional and ecommerce companies to sell and promote their real-world brands, goods and services, to a hard to reach audience they have potentially never had access to before.
Available worldwide, 'The Island' is built on the Unreal Engine 5 games engine which is compatible with the PC, mobile phone, games consoles and smart TV's, and will be powered, governed and be forever evolving thanks to a growing number of communities including blockchain, Unreal game developers, Voxel, 3D artists and modelers and general game enthusiasts.
Creators and players will discover a new form of currency economics where they can create and trade their own NFT's in-game or on 3rd party marketplaces, and no longer will their purchased game assets be trapped inside a single game again.
A disruptive gaming revolution is upon us and Cornucopias 'The Island' awaits everyone to come and join in the fun of changing gaming forever!
Cardano Background
As a member of the Original 50 Cardano Project Catalyst I have been active in the community and have been working on the Cardano network for over a year - I have successfully delivered a project in Fund 3 https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Visual-Studio-Smart-Contract-Plugin/333827-48088 and I am working on a project for Fund 4.
Knowing the eco-system and community so well I formed a new company in January 2021 dedicated to writing a blockchain game on Cardano. Self-funded with 4 other Cardano pioneers to date we have been busy planning the game, building the team and putting together the Whitepaper and a series of demos to show the community how the game may work.
Cornucopias 'The Island' Game could not have been possible without Project Catalyst introducing me to Cardano however to date it has all been bootstrapped and has had no Catalyst funding.
I want to continue to build Open Source software for the community to use alongside building the game, and if this project is successfully funded I will produce the following using members of the Plutus Pioneer courses to both help my project and to help others in the community to put their new skills to work.
'The Island' is powered by NFT's as players build upon and own the land, characters items and real estate. The game will allow community members to own their own NFT shop and allow them to sell their NFT's.
I therefore need Smart Contracts to help many transactions occur.
The first open source project I need Smart Contracts for is an NFT Auction House. This will be a key feature to help community members to auction their NFT's and in addition the software will be usable away from The Island to help others grow their own software companies.
Why gaming on Cardano?
There are so many reasons to build an NFT game on Cardano, don't look at the network in August 2021 look where it will be in August 2022. We will have:
- lots of DeFi applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.
- lots of NFT applications and developers that we can integrate and partner with on 'The Island'.
- lots of Plutus developers we can offer full time jobs.
- Atala Prism will allow us to verify players age which is really important to parts of the game and something no other Blockchain can offer.
- Hydra will offer 1 million transactions per second
- scalability and reliability is critical for a game that is aiming to attract 1m+ players
What does success look like?
Success will be judged on the games popularity and to date we are growing a very good reputation on social media and a lot of positive 'buzz' is happening around the game.
We are looking at bringing over 1 million gamers to the Cardano Network within the first 3 years of launch and are looking to recruit many people from inside the Cardano community.
The Play-to-Earn and Build-To-Earn features of the game will bring prosperity to gamers like never before and has the chance to change lives in many countries.
We have recently teamed up with an Education Centre that holds virtual lessons in Africa and the Learn-To-Earn aspect of the game will help that eco-system grow further.
Stake-To-Earn aims to simplify staking and yield farming using a gamification style interface.
Success will also come in the form of recognition that Cardano is an amazing platform to build NFT Gaming on.
What does the current team look like?
I have a small team of developers, testers and analysts at my disposal that have worked together on many projects. I am self-funding the project. I started building the game alongside my full-time job in January and in July I went full-time working on the game - a huge leap of faith as I have no means of making an income until the game launches. Currently there are 9 members of the team.

Development Costs Estimate:
Delivery:
The final game will take years to build however a series of Milestones will be achieved over the months to bring the game to life using the Agile delivery method, with the first Web Browser version available in Q1 2022.
This project is to fund Plutus Pioneer to convert our Cardano CLI NFT scripts into Smart Contracts and to build additional Smart Contract functionality.
Costs:
90% of the funds will be paid to Plutus Pioneer graduates and the rest will be used to integrate the Smart Contracts built into 'The Island' game.

A virtual real estate platform that cultivates and showcases the robust talent and real life utility within the Cardano ecosystem.",1,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 11:45",olgaheien,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/olgaheien/3097579-48088,,,50000,Requested funds in USD,"

""Show me Cardano! Where is it? Don't you dare point me to Crypto-Twitter!""
Tech Town Cardano (TTC) is a virtual real estate platform with the primary purpose of cultivating and showcasing the robust talent and real life utility within the Cardano ecosystem. TTC is many things, it's a hybrid of virtual real estate, developers incubator, a hub for investors from outside of Cardano/ crypto who can find real life utility for their businesses on the platform. Game like design allows people to be more ""playful"" and creative even when going for an important business deal. Developers have all the freedom to learn, experiment, build up their property and sell their services. Random guests are welcome to visit TTC, join events, shop, just roam around, meet other players and even get access to open source information /educational materials.
In recent years a boom of virtual real estate with the biggest platform Decentraland shook the world. Though these platforms have been criticised for having practically no real life utility, perceived as another ""bubble"", there are many sings of an exponential growth of virtual real estate in the nearest future for a number of reason. COVID lockdown showed how much certain businesses have a need to move to an online space and use a platform that can provide customers with an interactive online experience. 
""Investing in digital real estate captures all the positive aspects of derivative trades (asymmetric reward-risk) without the bad (recourse margin/debt), and is also an uncorrelated asset class that offsets market volatility. Although it was previously believed that cryptocurrencies (especially BTC) were like digital gold, backtesting has shown that crypto assets behave differently from gold, equities or bonds. Hence, it's an extremely useful portfolio diversification tool."" Janine Yorio (head of the real estate group at Republic and the Republic Realm fund, a digital real estate NFT fund).
Virtual real estate platform on Cardano has many advantages compared to other ones: 1) Because of PoS protocols, it can be presented as a more environmentally friendly platform 2) undeniable reputation of Cardano community and highly competitive road map 3) A new wave of DApps meeting rising global needs will be powered by Cardano strong scientific/creative community and Project Catalyst funds 4) Cardano´s strong decentralisation will make the platform more transparent 5) Blockchain standards make the platform less prone to fraud
Let's take a walk through Tech Town Cardano. As we enter the website we can either be a guest or ""become an owner"". The map of TTC is a circle with plots of land and several ""public areas"" that are represented by Cardano logo pattern. You can customise your own avatar and start exploring. By January - February 2022 we can already discover a simple map with some infrastructure and main tools/workshops that allow new developers to learn and start building property on the plots. The map is ""open"" only partially. 1.000 plots are in the game by now. As the time goes on we will be able to discover both simple and eccentric digital property built by developers and customised in accordance with their goal on the platform. Another 1.000 plots are opened up and we can see first investors hiring a ""construction team"" for their plots. They can use the plot/property to showcase their dapps to potential investors, create a store, have a VR tour for real estate business clients, monetise their skills/services, etc. The idea is to give a boost to a big labour market on Cardano by bringing a significant amount of investors who have ""real life businesses"" and can profit from the utility provided by TTC. Some of the business type examples: real estate, construction companies, designers/ interior designers, digital marketing, lawyers in crypto space, eco-products, etc. 
All features in this proposal are subject to change. For now we envision 10.000 plots in total existing on the platform. 5.000 plots of land will be reserved to Plutus Pioneers, other blockchain developers and individuals highly invested in Cardano who are interested in fostering and ushering in a new paradigm of real life blockchain utility. These plots will be sold for a minimum fee (50-150 ADA) to those who can demonstrate that they will invest themselves into the platform, offer a project that they can build up on their plot in next months. There will also be a promotional campaign with the purpose to bring in developers from outside of Cardano. They will also be able to get a minimum fee plot if they sign up for becoming a Cardano developer. 
Taking into account the growing demand for developers on Cardano - the platform serves as an incubator for new specialists -small fee plots boost the amount of people who would want to invest themselves into the platform.
Other 5.000 plots will be sold to investors for a much higher price in order to create funds necessary for further platform development. 
""Last question before I go shower, can anyone make a real bull case for $ADA? Does anyone build on it? Use it? Why is market cap so high?"" Mike Novogratz. Mikey, what about taking a bathtub in your new TTC penthouse?
Open-source and decentralized, TTC may be best thought of as central hub for blockchain developers, dreamers, gamers, entrepreneurs, investors, educators, merchants, artists, and all out awesome people to meet, interact, and build. 
""What matters in the virtual world is bringing humanity and life to something flat and pixelated, drawing players somewhere, and then encouraging them to return and interact. (These settlements are often called ""clusters of content."") In the virtual world, ingenuity and design matter far more than location and budget."" Janine Yorio
Still we want to have a real life haven for TTC. We plan to raise funds in order to acquire an island and build facilities that can host 50 people at ones, it will be a hang out place for TTC developers. The island will be fractionalized and randomly given away to developers in form of NFTs (through a quest or hiding them inside the plots). This way developers will get a partial ownership of TTC Haven, and its NFTs price will go up with the time. They can always sell these NFTs to smn else in TTC developer community for a profit/ funds for their project.
So far it's been an exciting journey for us and we have a lot of other suggestions and details that are yet to figure out. We are looking for people who are going to bring in some craziness of their mind and soul, become part of our core team.

We don't really need the money (already raised $2M in private investment) - we want to partner with other great people in the Cardano ecosystem through exposure in Catalyst, which is why I set the requested funds to $1.
 
We have already pulled together 5 billion worth of assets and just got done having them assessed by GIA, Earnst & Young, etc. 
 
We are minting 500M Outlaw tokens (OTLW) that when held will grant the owner who ""stakes"" them the opportunity to win Outlaw NFTs as a staking reward. Each NFT will be cryptographically linked 1-to-1 to real world assets like gemstones, gold bullion, art, collector wine, etc.  This is phase 1.
 
We've already written much of the smart contracts and will be starting on the PAB components as soon as they become available on the testnet. 
 
We are about to finalize our white paper in the first week of September. We have an excellent marketing team that has put together an excellent plan for going to market. 
 
We do need 1 more developer that does full stack development to help build out our phase 2 planned marketplace and gamification components that are currently being designed in the studio. 
For a phase 3 we have a Plutus supported wallet/credit card that'll give the user the ability to create a credit line with a LTV based upon their crypto assets without having to sell their crypto (which is what all other crypto cards require) and then use that credit line on their Visa card. This allows the appraisal of crypto assets in the user's wallet.

Introduction to Offsite Modular Construction of Housing which is ""Faster, Better, Cheaper & Greener!""
(Please watch the Video Below)

The fastest & most cost-effective way of building housing is offsite modular construction in factories, because production line techniques can be used & there are no delays for events like bad weather.
Benefits of the Cardano Blockchain with modular construction.
Modular Housing Factories can be built anywhere in the world that has a housing shortage & needs employment, using a standard basic model we save money, then exterior & interior finishes will use local materials suitable for budgets and the environment.
Cardano Blockchain would control the materials supply-chain, transportation & assembly of the modules, each housing module can be held in an NFT, an NFT can be created for the plot of land and finally there would be an NFT that would record the marriage of the modules and the land in the package.
The land & building ownership would be held in an NFT and registered on the blockchain, there will be a tangible uplift in value as the parts are being put together and then the ""marriage-value"" of the modules with the land will create profits.
Housing factories can be created all over the world, materials and pricing can be tailored to the local economy.
Real time tracking will be displayed online to co-ordinate works in the factory and on the building plot of land to ensure a smooth installation on the day of delivery.
Benefits of Offsite Modular Construction
Faster – Quicker delivery
The Modules and pods can be installed on site in a matter of days for smaller homes and a few weeks for say a block of flats, the upside is obvious but I would highlight the number of lost working days with traditional building methods due to bad weather – this is not an issue with offsite modular construction particularly as the modules are normally weather proof on delivery.
As our buildings are constructed inside factories we are not effected by delays caused by bad weather, bad light or theft.
Better – Higher Quality
As the modules that make up our buildings, and the fitting out of them, is completed inside a factory the quality can be monitored more easily and quality control maintained.
Also as we primarily use steel to build our modular building units we can achieve millimeter accuracy in the construction and fitting out. This accuracy is maintained through the life of the building due to the higher strength of steel as our primary building material.
Cheaper - Lower prices
Mass production of standardised modular units and pods which are assembled on a production line basis will drastically reduce the overall cost, the reduced time for workmen to be on site is also a hidden cost benefit along with theft of materials and equipment which is identified as a significant cost with traditional building methods.
Greener - Ecological & sustainable
As mentioned, before we can employ the very best recyclable materials and finishes which will be mounted on steel modular frames, these materials offer the best thermal resistance in both the heat and cold making the resulting home much better and efficient to live in.
Better water management
Due to the flexibility of design, we are easily able to collect rain water and run it into a grey water management system which can be used to flush toilets etc. reducing the demand on the main water supply which in turn reduces costs to the home owner.
Efficient use of utilities
Overall, the above benefits will reduce the usage of heating & cooling within the home, it will allow the easier maintenance of the ideal ambient temperature. We can also add elements of solar power generation to reduce the reliance on external power sources. 
Standardisation
The modules are built with special module measurements with a steel frame to withstand shipping and strength requirements, manufacturing takes place in the factory.
Structural integrity
Currently, the modules can be built up to 6 floors without additional structural support.
Design Flexibility
Opportunity for different expressions, due to the modular elements you have a greater variety of optional layouts that are quickly implemented.
Environmentally Friendly
Environmentally friendly production as the materials and modules can be recycled after use and reused.
Efficient Energy Solutions
Well insulated using the most up to date efficient materials which are constantly reviewed. We can easily incorporate the very latest ecologically beneficial facilities such as solar power generation and grey water management, all installed in the comfort of our factory.
Smart Technology & Internet of Things
It is much easier to incorporate WiFi, Solar panels, internet access wiring etc. in a factory setting.
Fulfills Planning Requirements
The modules are built according to national and local planning regulations resulting in stronger more durable buildings, new homes are also insured for up to 10 years.
Advantages of offsite manufacture for construction
1. What are the opportunities offered by offsite manufacture for construction? What are the likely drawbacks? What factors are likely to influence clients, architects, design engineers, contractors and the supply chain in deciding whether to choose offsite manufacture?
a. OPPORTUNITIES: ""Deliverability"";
i. Affordable residential housing
ii. Filling the UK housing shortage needs
iii. Providing jobs in highest areas of unemployment
iv. Positioning offsite factories where there are skilled people
v. Better comfortable working environment for employees
vi. Efficient production line techniques can be employed
vii. Develop efficiency by standardisation of many elements
viii. Robotics can be used to complete repetitive actions
ix. Potential to develop specialist factories as part of supply chain
x. Just-in-time delivery schedules can be employed for materials
xi. Bulk delivery of components and materials possible
xii. Reduction of pollution due to less transport movements
xiii. Factories can be positioned to take advantage of both road & rail
xiv. Intermodal transportation can be used by designing to ISO sizes
xv. Reduce negative impacts around building sites
xvi. Certainty of development completion timescales
xvii. Reduction of delays caused by bad weather
xviii. Ground works completed at the same time as the building is built
xix. Centralisation of components and materials
xx. Inclusion of more recyclable & sustainable materials such as steel
xxi. Opportunity to supply modules both B2B and directly B2C
xxii. Websites can be created where people can ""design your own home"" and a full quotation automatically created (excluding the cost of land) and payment taken.
b. The cost of a modular home does not vary because of the geographic final location, the only geographic variable is the cost of land.DRAWBACKS: ""Education"";
i. Resistance by traditional (House) builders
ii. Resistance by the brick & slate industries
iii. Acceptance by the public
iv. Acceptance by the mortgage market
v. Incorrect perception that this is lower quality construction
vi. Memories of post-war ""prefab"" housing.
2. Offsite manufacture of housing can lead to;
a. lower costs, faster delivery and increased quality;
b. increased productivity;
c. improved health and safety;
d. greater provision of new, affordable housing.
What is the evidence for this?
a. lower costs, faster delivery and increased quality; Generally through centralisation of labour and materials with reduced transportation of employees and materials. The key to faster delivery is that groundworks and the creation of the building take place in parallel resulting in a potential saving of 50% of the time required to complete. As all buildings are completed inside factories the conditions are totally controlled; heating, lighting and employee's facilities. With the availability of specialist equipment, leading materials available and production-line techniques the highest quality can be maintained.
b. increased productivity; Due to the totally controlled working environment potential stoppages and downtime due to weather are eliminated also better working conditions leads to happier more productive workers.
c. improved health and safety; Once again through the controlled working environments possible matters such as visibility is increased, errors caused by cold or wet hands avoided and systems and processes can be put in place more easily in a factory environment.
d. greater provision of new, affordable housing; As our evidence is titled offsite modular construction of housing is: ""Faster, Better, Cheaper & Greener!""
Generally taking 50% of the time, Higher quality in structural and thermal qualities, due to time saved, transportation reductions, reduced financing periods and quicker delivery to the open market a minimum of 25% can be saved which can be 'passed on' to the open market & local government (Only land value will fluctuate around the country).
Modular construction will allow a wider range of housing solutions, infilling on small sites (uneconomic for traditional builders), self-supporting housing using air-rights (over shops, commercial buildings, carparks), both temporary and permanent housing (Houses and flats) can be provided to suit special situations or local authority requirements. Land can be developed quickly and efficiently avoiding the requirement for land banking to create a ""pipeline"" of developable land.
Potential barriers to wider use of offsite manufacture
3. What are the drawbacks to offsite manufacture for construction?
a. We do not see any drawbacks to the efficiencies provided by this method of construction.
4. What re-skilling of the construction workforce is required to facilitate a change to more off-site manufacture for construction?
a. A large part of the industry will have to get used to working inside in clean and efficient factories.
b. The industry will have to get used to using new more efficient materials.
c. Builders will become more technical and use more specialist tools and automated systems on production lines.
5. Can the benefits of standardisation and factory manufacture be realised without hampering architectural ambition? If so, how?
a. Due to the wide range of construction materials and finishes architects will be more liberated and have a wider scope for design creativity.
b. Many more ecological and energy saving technologies can be incorporated into the very fabric of the buildings, even becoming part of the structure.
6. What R&D is needed, and by whom, to realise fully the potential benefits of off- site manufacture?
a. Entrepreneurs running private organisations will be the very best to develop this opportunity.
b. Passion, dedication and competition within the market place will produce the best results.
 
Thank you for reading this proposal, I hope you see the need for a better approach to housing supply.

##  Abstract
NFTs allow us to record authenticity for scientific data, from papers to 3D scans. As with NFT art, the data itself can be stored permanently in a blockchain (see Arweave), with the digital signature of authenticity connected to the data via a hash check tied to the Cardano NFT. NFTs can also be used as a funding model, via sales of artistically rendered trading cards.
##  Current Situation
For the past 5 years I have worked with the Digital Life project, and our partners, to scan and share 3D models of life on earth for the purpose education, conservation and open access science. We collected many terabytes worth of data, from written measurements, to photographs, to CT scans, photogrammetry scans and finalised much of this data in scientific papers and animated 3D models. To simplify collaboration and ensure that our process can be shared, we use open-source tools for the processing of the data. Our partners agree to the sharing of this information with the rest of the world.
Therefore, our finalised models are put online, and free to use for non-commercial purposes.
Our current animal library: https://sketchfab.com/DigitalLife3D
Examples of some of our project processes include:

##  Challenges
The biggest challenges with such a project involve team scalability, proof of authenticity and accessibility.
We also require an immutable *permanent* storage for the data. Currently, most of this data exists on centralized servers that are owned by third parties. There is no guarantee that this data will survive 50+ years, much less the next 10.
In order to progress towards a goal of digitally capturing life on our planet, we need a massive team, and systems that permit the flexibility to handle the various scanning scenarios (in the lab, in the forest, on the beach, under water, etc.) This requires a large and *diverse* team.
Digitizing and cleaning up these 3D models require weeks and/or months of work, requiring budgets that can put pressure on a project, which could result in compromised quality or unpaid work for time invested. Payments often flow through a third party, with payments being delayed for weeks or months.
Many of the artists working in these projects, including myself, do not have a science degree from an accredited academic establishment. Our reputation is based on our work and our relationships. Unfortunately, this information is not easily accessible or verifiable. Additionally, some of our work is of a very sensitive nature, and there might be a scenario where one would be uncomfortable with putting their home addresses on publications. Without an official role at an accredited establishment, or a home address, this could affect reputation of the data or publication.
How can we ""pass the torch"" for our research? How can we ensure we are using best ethical practices. How can How does an anonymous researcher collaborate, create reputation or receive funding without association to a *physical* establishment? How can we ensure that the work is authentic, immutable and ethical?
###  Solutions
NFTs are (literally) the missing link in all this. Like a web, they connect the data to an immutable record of the individuals involved in the research. Utilizing blockchain storage technologies like Arweave, the data can be stored in an immutable state with a connection to the NFT via verifiable hash. Currently, this method of storing artistic JPGs is being used, more and more, by the various NFT platforms.
*see arweave.org
NFTs can be awarded to patrons as a ""trophy"" to publicly demonstrate their contributions. If these trophies are ever passed on, a portion of the sale can be shared with the creators and partners, to seed future projects.
NFTs can also be used as entry tickets to patrons, granting access to ""work in progress"" data, enabling them to follow the process of the project prior to the final model being released to the public.
Reputation is established via association, visible in the blockchain. Connections can be made between the artists, scientists and patrons. This creates a transparent record of partnerships which can be used to determine effective partnerships. Perhaps PRISM could even be helpful in this scenario, though with the option to give reputation to an artist, researcher or patron that wishes to remain anonymous, while still receiving reputation.
###  Moving Into the Future
Though outside the scope of this proposal, I would like to touch on some of the other solutions for the future.
In regards to payments: smart contracts could be used to enable partnerships to funded via escrow accounts. This could also allow for the transparency of project funding.
Teams could integrate these smart contract methods with projects like Swarm, where temporary storage could be used for works in progress, triggering payments when milestone deliveries are made.
*see https://www.ethswarm.org/
To improve on the scientific method, the peer review process could be managed by a system like Cardano's Catalyst. When working with animals, ethics is always a major concern, and involving peers in a way where they can vote on methods used, can hopefully steer us into the most sustainable and compassionate procedures.
##  Summary
Having spent years pondering these problems, the biggest challenge tends to be the speed and reliability of non-democratic centralised systems, the immutability permanent storage, and archaic funding models.
Additionally, as we work in conservation, there will always be concerns that many of the decentralised systems are inefficient, inaccessible and the massive amount of energy consumed is dangerous to the planet.
Cardano solves many, if not *all* these concerns.
Cardano is built to be a scalable system that allows for the use of NFTs, hash checks, smart contracts, voting, wallets and integration with outside decentralised data storage solutions.
I believe this system could act as the foundation for the preservation of science and culture (but am starting with what I know).
Additionally, I believe the strong visual element to this work allows others to bridge their current concepts of what NFTs are for (artwork) with something new (science).

*** Our philosophy ***
Bitcoin gave us free-circulating money. Ethereum established a framework for decentralized engineering. Cardano upgraded and formalized scalability and robustness. The next evolution, we think, is an NFT-enabled free-circulation, traceability and marketization of intellectual property rights. And by extension, knowledge.

*** Problem definition ***
Academic publishing primarily happens in closed-access journals (dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4375) and is the only system in which authors lose all rights to their creations. The current system is certainly not ideal, especially when contrasted with other publishing fields such as newspapers, biographies, scripts, plays and novels.
Scientific publishing is a multi-billion dollar industry in which scientists generate the product and receive no benefit. In addition, the top-ranking companies have profits that can go up to 40%, meaning there is a big margin to redirect some of these benefits to the scientists. The problem is that there is no platform currently in place that would allow a connection between the producer (scientist) and the profits generated by the product (scientific content). What is lacking is a bridge for profits to flow directly to the scientist, without the need for a middleman.
With the growing popularity of open access journals (PLOS publisher), the scientific community seems to recognize that the marketization of research has reached a state of oligopoly (few journals with massive influence are able to overprice access to research).
Free-circulating knowledge would allow for different monetization schemes for scientists, something researchers in every domain needs. The more funding for research, the better.
For knowledge to truly become free-circulating, the following 3 criteria need to be met.

Researchers should keep ownership of their products.
They should be able to reap the benefits of those products when/if they become popular/impactful.
The public should have a right to transparent and easy access to the science they helped fund.

 
*** In depth ***
The current distribution of scientific knowledge to the world is based on a dual system: (1) Through private publishing groups that are in large part closed-access, and (2) with a patent-oriented system which is even more restrictive. We tend to believe that there is a better way.
Scientific results and documents are perceived by scientists as tools used to communicate new discoveries. However, they have an additional value for society. Compared to how a biography is a means for an individual to share their thoughts and experiences to the public, a scientific article is a tool scientists use to communicate with other scientists, almost exclusively, unfortunately due to the very nature of the medium itself. In fact, articles contain opinions, notably in the discussion section of a paper. Thus, scientific knowledge has intrinsic value beyond its logical conclusions, meaning a manuscript can be conceptualized as a literary document (such as a novel, journal, opinion article or poetry) or even a piece of art (such as photography, paintings) crafted to present results in the most honest and unbiased fashion. Like a vintage piece of literature or an art collectible, it could be acquired and traded.
Just as the first X-ray crystallography of DNA by Rosalind Franklin (https://i.stack.imgur.com/8XHZX.jpg) is viewed by many as a highly valued collectible, right now, digital content of this sort cannot enjoy the same properties. NFT technology is the missing link that would make this possible. How cool would it have been if the first paper that coined the name 'CRISPR' (dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x) was minted as an NFT ?
Manuscripts and other science collectibles can be minted into open science NFTs (osNFTs) and made available to society.
 
In this model, a scientific document or image would be transformed into an osNFT, creating verifiable rights for these digital assets. A system based on osNFTs would simultaneously retain the original author's copyright and make the asset a tradable product. Pre-set royalties would ensure perpetual revenue streams to the author/lab, where legal entities allow.
Transforming scientific results into osNFTs would effectively create a bridge between science and society. An asset can be acquired from the scientist and traded, establishing a market that would help identify which scientific questions are most relevant to society. In other words, supply and demand would generate a new metric by which we measure how society perceives a given scientific challenge. Creation of scientific content in this context would now be subject to quasi free-market conditions, unshackled from the selfish expectations of centralized entities. It would be a place where the public can have a say in the direction of science, effectively leading to a better democratization of it.
 
What is needed is a marketplace to make all of this possible.
 
We believe that value can be generated with ""Pay-per-own"" and ""Pay-per-view"" monetization strategies:

""Pay-per-own"": as a collectible, there is inherent value in a document that first reports a new method or discovery (historical, legal or religious documents have economic value as collectible items). An original scientific digital asset can be owned by someone who either (1) sees value in this item and expects its value to grow or (2) wants to donate to the field, and thus receive a 'stamp' which would effectively serve as a proof-of-donation. In the latter scenario, a re-sell of the osNFT would not generate income for the buyer (person who donated the money), the money would go instead to a treasury that would be used to fund additional research.
""Pay-per-view"": the current publication system requires authors to pay to publish and readers to pay exorbitant fees to access the document (tens of dollars for just one paper, or via subscription through universities, who pay fees so high, that the journal often times prohibits the university from publicly declaring the amount paid in subscriptions, money that very likely also comes from tax money and donations). In the case of open-access publications, readers can access the document for free, but the authors need to pay thousands of dollars to publish (https://plos.org/publish/fees/). In both cases, someone is at a huge financial disadvantage. With the ""pay-per-view"" strategy, for a very small price, anyone can get virtual access to the document, with the funds going to the author. The fee would be counted in cents, so that the user is not impacted when, say, they access hundreds of papers, but for the author, the sum of those small fees would add up to a substantial amount. A high-impact paper, with say 100k views a year, would yield 1000$/year if the price for viewing it is only 1 cent. Sadly, with the current web2 publishing standards, this model is not enforceable. However, with decentralized web3 open access journals that will inevitably come into existence, ""par-per-view"" has the potential to revolutionize the way science is funded, leading to true decentralization of research. We would love to address this point following the hopeful success of this proposal.

 
With all that, we strongly believe that the Cardano ecosystem, coupled with the osNFT model, would be the ideal platform to monetize digital content that is currently not being exploited by the scientific community, i.e., open access papers with copyright retention for the authors.
 
*** Concrete plan ***
As fun and revolutionary as our ideas might be, we are strongly of the view that being effective with a focused plan is better than having a great idea that is unable to gain traction. We do not wish to wait for a decentralized peer-review publishing platform to exist before we can apply our monetization strategy (Pay-per-own and Par-per-view). Instead, we will pour all our efforts in making the osNFT appeal to the public. This will give us our proof-of-concept that we will be able to build upon. After all, bitcoin itself was developed as a proof-of-concept before worldwide consensus decided to make it a global currency :).
 
Increasing public interest in science is our first and foremost priority, we are aware that NFTs are a concept that can be very abstract to people outside the crypto space. People can generally understand NFTs when applied to pictures, music, and other traditional art. Applying it to a high-level concept, such as knowledge, in the sense that we refer to here, would need a break-in period for most people to get a good grasp on its utility. For these reasons, will be focusing on 4 things:

Establishing a clear standard with visual examples of what an osNFT is.
Converting scientific content into art pieces while applying scientific rigour.
Introducing open-access papers into the system, asking authors to create or assist in the creation of visual representation of their paper's conclusions.
Build a marketplace for osNFTs that is visually appealing to most people.

 
*** Challenge metrics ***
Strategically, as science is heavily based on funding and more and more scientific research is purely 'dry' (informatics and data analysis), this project would most definitely expose a substantial number of highly skilled individuals to the Catalyst project and to the whole Cardano ecosystem, resulting in a net inflow of brain power to Cardano.
 
*** Execution steps ***
Phase 1 (1 month)

Formally define the osNFT standard and its underlying legal component (Open-Source, CC-BY, etc.).
Amass high-quality data and constructive feedback from high-profile PIs (Principal Investigators), from contacts at our workplace (academic high-tech research center).
Generate primitive osNFTs from PhD student's work (beautiful microscopy photos, sexy graphs, etc.) as a proof of concept. Sciwalkart, one of the submitters of this proposal, would be more than happy to mint their artistic work as osNFTs. 

 
Phase 2 (4 months)

Contact PIs from a curation of arxiv.org or PLOS papers for their potential enrolment in this project.
Refine and finalize the osNFTs standard.
Build a UI for the listing of the osNFTs on a decentralized hosting platform (Arweave permaweb).
Start working on tutorials.

 
Phase 3 (8 months)

Build an automated verification system that only allows copyright holders to submit their manuscripts (e.g., through the 'doi' standard).
Start the minting process of manuscripts into osNFTs from interested scientists.
Publicize the platform to generate public interest.

 
Phase 4 (12 months)

System is gaining traction; potential scalability issues are being addressed.
Marketplace is catching the public's eye; tutorials need to be updated.
Adapt the whole experience based on user feedback.

 
*** Defining success ***

Both the scientific community and the public sees value in osNFTs and start minting (scientists) and trading (public).

 

Revenue generated from the marketplace would allow the creation of a treasury for future scientific research funding.

 
 
 
*** Budget (in USD) ***

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Market growth for ""specialty"" mushrooms has... mushroomed in recent years.  There are species of wild gourmet and medicinal fungi with market potential that have not been developed for commercial cultivation due to the current siloed nature of commercial mushroom R+D.
While the R+D is siloed, mushrooms strains are all around us that have the potential to contribute to breeding programs that will birth entirely new commercially-viable varieties.  
By incentivizing the networking of foragers with DIY mycology labs, professional labs, and mushroom farms, we can accelerate the rate of R+D tremendously, while democratizing the commercialization of new mushroom varieties.  All while having a lot of fun with NFTs.
It is also important to understand that the majority of specialty mushroom cultivation takes place within a relatively narrow scope of parameters.  When we realize that people around the world, in different climates, with different resources, are awakening a love for eating and for growing mushrooms, the number of potential species goes far beyond what the established mushroom farms in the world can grow commercially, and we can help to facilitate development of regionally-relevant mushrooms throughout the world for growers of all size, while we are focused on leveraging the desire of established farmers to offer new species to their customers. 
For the sake of focus, let's focus on one species: Chicken of the Woods (a.k.a chicken mushroom, sulphur shelf, laetiporus sulphureus/cincinnatus)
I have some ideas for how to approach this challenge that I'll summarize here.  But I am one person with a limited scope and all I can do at this point is offer a ""draft"" for how to structure the project.  The goal of this Fund6 proposal is to take the following ""draft"" and forming it into a strong proof-of-concept. We warmly welcome you to join if you have perspectives/ideas/skills to bring to the table.  
Who do we need on the team for Fund6?  This project involves networking individuals who are not crypto savvy and making it easy for them to participate, so there will be an emphasis on user-friendly front end.  We may (or may not) need to deploy sound smart contracts that are adapted from e.g. Marlowe and execute on block chains/side chains (TBD).  While we may not begin the ""build"" in this funding round, it would be extremely helpful to have the developer expertise there to help us understand what is possible.  Because we may be stepping into the waters of financial regulations, we also need a legal expert in this field to assure that we aren't opening a can o' regulatory worms.
We also look forward to piggybacking on the great work happening in the Cardano NFT marketplace world.  Some of the biggest open questions in the project are related to how NFTs are bought and sold, both initially and in the aftermarket.  Looking forward to exploring our options with this exciting community!
STEP 1: COLLECT THE GENES
The first step in any breeding program worth its muster is to amass a collection of wild strains, preserved as mycelial cultures.  These cultures can be held at any of the participating mycological Culture Libraries.  For now, these culture libraries simply back up copies of the culture and keep them in safe long term storage.  Down the road, the culture libraries will be responsible for cloning and distributing strains to growers involved in the breeding program.
Who collects the genes?  Foragers!  For a forager to participate they must a) open an ada wallet,  and share b) a photo of the wild mushroom c) metadata associated with the wild strain (location and time of harvest, species of tree host etc.) , and d) a name for their strain and most importantly they must e) send a viable culture of their strain's mycelium to a participating culture library.  For now, we will leave out f) the smart-contract piece.  
Why would a forager want to participate?  Besides the desire to participate in a fun passion project?  Here's where NFTs make their entrance.  A forager that goes through all required steps is issued a token that symbolizes or represents their strain(s).  This NFT, either through natural market forces or executable smart contracts gives them a potential ""stake"" in the final product.  If a strain they provided goes through the decentralized breeding program and ends up contributing genetics to a final commercial strain, then the value of their NFT goes up, either organically, or through executing their equity.  Before we proceed, it's important to make a distinction between two types of NFTs that we can deploy:
Wild-Type vs Executable NFTs pt. 1
My understanding is that we can break NFTs into two categories: one I'll call ""wild-type"" and the other I'll call ""executable"" for lack of better words.  There may be better terms for these concepts floating out there.  Wild type NFT is one that functions solely as a collectible.  While there may be basic smart contracts that enable more functionality than standard collectibles e.g. splitting up ownership, or even royalties paid out during aftermarket activity, these smart contracts pertain only to the collectible itself.  An executable NFT on the other hand represents other assets beyond the NFT itself.  Smart contracts can execute functions that relate to the underlying assets.
In my view, if we have a shot at accomplishing what we want with a Wild Type NFT, we should give it a shot.  In other words, if we can rely on the raw ""collectability"" of a token, we can perhaps achieve our goals with limited regulatory contact.
In the wild type, the NFT is a collectible that functions as a ""symbol"" of a wild mushroom strain.  In the executable type, the NFT represents a physical asset (the genes of a wild mushroom).
In the latter type, smart contracts define the owners equity in the final product (the commercial strain(s)) should they be lucky enough to contribute genetics.
But, wouldn't it be cool if the game theoretics of the marketplace play out such that a wild-type NFT owned by a forager (a collectible that chronicles a wild strain rather than represents it)  would organically demand a higher price on the open market thanks to its scarcity, uniqueness, and the story around it?
****Please see comments from @solarcatzshelley below for more relevant info on the Howey Test and how this applies to the NFTs in this proposal and others.***on to step 2:
 
STEP 2: GROW OUT AND BREED THE STRAINS:
At this point we have culture libraries filled with backups of unique strains.  We have the gene pool we need to begin actively growing and breeding the strains.  Now it's time to activate the Growers!
 A mushroom like chicken of the woods is going to have only a small fraction of wild strains produce even a tiny fruit indoors.  A strain that produces a fruit, any fruit, is a viable candidate for further breeding, especially if the fruit matures healthily and produces spores (generating even more genetic potential).  Other characteristics that might ""level up"" a strain in the program would be flavor, promiscuity of tree host type, or other phenotypic indicators.
What would incentivize a grower (farmer, hobbyist, research company) to work with the strains?  Well. the hope of breeding something good!  If a forager is incentivize to contribute viable wild strains, a grower is incentivized to advance the breeding program by identifying which wild strains fruit, crossing spores of fruiting strains to yield new strains with e.g. higher yields.  New strains are new NFTs, whether from the wild or from the lab.  
How does a grower gain access to the genetic library?  First, they must pledge to share any new viable strains that they develop with culture libraries, to be shared with other growers.  We hope that social pressure will prevent them from going rogue and conducting a proprietary breeding program; i.e. if they come out with their commercial strain without sharing it, we shame them for being bad actors in the community, and they are unable to participate in the co-branding opportunity (see below).  If there is genetic analysis done on strains, there may even be evidence of wrongdoing.  Anyway, to facilitate the economics of the whole thing, growers may also pay the culture libraries for their strains.  This is how culture libraries traditionally make their money, so this is pretty close to business-as-usual.
 
STEP 3: ACHEIVING COMMERCIAL STRAIN STATUS
So now we have wild strains backed up by NFTs, we have cultivated strains backed up by NFTs, and we are beginning to make headway.  With every generation, new, better strains are coming out until eventually a grower makes a big hit.  They grow a mushroom that is commercially viable, meaning it's high yielding (enough), tastes good, has decent shelf life, and growth parameters that are fairly easily duplicated.
If you are the grower who hits the jackpot, your NFT represents a commercially viable strain, the metadata includes any important information related to substrate, temperature, fruiting platforms, incubation time etc.  You submit an early-generation culture to a culture library, and that culture library backs up versions of this to go out to other culture libraries, so the entire community of growers involved in the project has access to the youngest, least senescent version of this strain to begin growing the strain for market.
To incentivize the project as a whole, we will try and keep the strain ""in the family"" at first while we keep things quiet on the marketing side, giving the network of growers a chance to be the first to get chicken of the woods to their customers.  Inevitably, someone will clone the mushroom from a store and the commercial strain will get out into the public, albeit not backed up in its youngest form.  But that's ok, because the project was a success!
 
FURTHER DISCUSSION
Wild-Type vs Executable NFTs pt 2.  equity chain of custody vs co-branding
Making our way back to the question of wild type vs executable NFTs.  Culture libraries, spawn companies make their money by selling commercial strains and spawn made from these strains.  This is an established income stream.  Perhaps there is incentive for culture libraries to be involved to give them first dibs on selling the cultures and spawn to buyers. 
Chain of Custody via Executable-Type NFTs.  If this is the case, the executable-type NFTs could all connect up to this company itself to the point that all sales of the strain distribute profit down the chain- to the grower that developed the final strain to all the growers who contributed genetics to that strain to all the foragers who contributed genetics to those strains.  All through  smart-contract-backed-NFTs.
Co-Branding via Wild Type NFTs. On the other hand, if we go the wild-type NFT route, we may be able to leverage the story in an ongoing way to encourage value to flow organically through to members in the chain of custody.  Growers can co-brand the chicken of the woods products they sell to end-consumers, plastering the packaging with a collage of all the images of the NFTs that contributed to the final product.  Future fans of the product will see those images, read up on the backstory and find out that they too can play along by becoming the proud owner of one of those NFTs.  They visit the project's NFT marketplace (auction??) and pay up. 
non-NFT-based profit sharing
There can also be smart contracts deployed in the project not connected to NFTs.  There can be, for instance, some level of profit sharing for all participants, whether they contributed to the final strain or not.  This might look like future ""releases"" of NFTs by the project as a whole, where % proceeds go out to all participants.  
onboarding a new network to Cardano
A valuable ""bi-product"" :  We now have a network of foragers, growers, labs etc with Ada wallets and a track record of participating in real-life applications.  We can use this network to tackle new challenges.  The network of foragers and farmers and their markets can drive new innovation in areas like establishing incentives for responsible stewardship of forests  (sorely needed, blog post coming out eventually on this topic).  We can take on new species for similar breeding programs.  The sky's the limit.  And with more activity, we drive more adoption, more wallets opening up and a strong network effect.  
The end result?  Cardano is the digital ecosystem for Mushroom people.  And mushroom people are the coolest :)
Looking Ahead
Should we be fortunate enough to earn funding for this project, the next step is to actually build it out!  The front end, the marketplace, smart contracts, marketing team etc.  This will be a much larger undertaking than the proof-of-concept we hope to develop with funding this round.  
But a breeding program takes time.  It's likely 2+ years until a given commercial strain comes to fruition.  There is no reason to wait 2 years to begin taking action on the product side.  Using our network of foragers (and onboarding yet more with this:) we can begin marketing different ""decentralized"" product(s).  I have a delicious, nutritious, warm, creamy, rich, chaga-full beverage recipe that tells a story of the forest and which utilizes 4+ wild-crafted products.  I would be more than happy to ""decentralize"" this recipe in order to get a jumpstart on answering first-principle questions related to ""what is a decentralized product?"" A recipe clue: the main ingredient is chaga.
 
TIMELINE (no later than...)
3 Months: Establish the core team responsible for releasing the ""proof of concept""
6 Months:  produce a white paper/ white board + initial build outs / mock ups.
9 Months:  seek additional funding proposal for the build-out (via catalyst and/or issuance of Cardano Conk NFTs and/or traditional financing)
12 Months: Public Launch, by September 2022 40+ unique wallet addresses from foragers and 2+ culture libraries so we can begin collecting wild strains.
 
BUDGET
2500 for telling the story, white paper, white board, networking in the mushroom world (that's me and those who want to help)
3000 for developer consultation and mock-ups (front-end, smart contracts, user experience)
500 for legal consultation as relates to regulations and NFTs.  
 
My Commitment:  Whether this proposal receives funding or not, I am committed to helping to make Cardano and Catalyst as strong an ecosystem as possible, and I will continue to share my general and proposal-specific thoughts on the blog regenseed.io
 
Thank you for your consideration.

The 2019 Cardano Summit brought about the partnership between IOHK and New Balance to utilize the blockchain in ensuring physical product authenticity and assisting on the crackdown of counterfeit goods. Fast forward to 2021, luxury umbrella corporations are coming together to try and find an NFT-based solution to package to their client base. 
Example: LVMH, Prada Group, and Cartier came together on April 20th, 2021 to form the Aura Blockchain Consortium (""supporting the first global blockchain dedicated to the luxury goods industry"" - https://auraluxuryblockchain.com/#about ). And Richemont, an associate member of the Arianee blockchain ( https://www.arianee.org/members )
 
The concerns I'm seeing from Aura and Arianee that I believe Cardano is built to tackle are; lack of transparency (Aura) and lack of NFT client anonymity (Arianee). 
 
I wish to propose collaborating with the IOHK and New Balance team to extend/scale the brand partnerships, providing the blockchain's ability to supply NFTs to the purchase of physical luxury goods to aid in authentication for re-sell and long term asset ownership in a discrete manner. 
Cardano/New Balance steps:
""For the New Balance OMN1S shoes, customers will receive a Realchain card with an embedded identity and security chip. Upon receiving the shoes, the customer can then use the New Balance app to scan a Quick Response code on the card with the app and will be prompted to scan the chip within the card and that will authenticate the shoes on the IOHK Cardano blockchain.
Customers can then claim ownership of the shoes by entering a code printed on the tongue of the shoes into the app. From this point on, the ownership of the shoes is secured to the owner using the New Balance Realchain blockchain platform."" -https://siliconangle.com/2019/10/17/sneakers-meet-blockchain-new-balance-pilot-shoe-authenticity/ 
 
If anyone has more information on any items listed above, your comments are greatly appreciated! We're in an interesting time where even companies with clout tend to apply the 'cart-before-the-horse' method. Here's to hoping we can bring Cardano to their attention so they don't end up with frayed edges in the future and grow client reassurance.

The current way we validate people's history is to make an initial judgement based on what is written by them on a document in front of us. There is no way except to check with referees and formal qualification holders that what we are being told is in fact true. This is open to collusion. NFT as a verifiable holder of each entry can be universally available across a range of platforms and be carried by the candidate literally in their pocket and shared with recruiters or provided during the application process.
An NFT based portfolio can hold the qualifications, certifications, employment history, course completion certificates, certification tokens, seminar participation etc as an asset with verified credentials – something that as an NFT, will have indisputable providence.
For those that need it, qualifications and certification could be created with end dates, so that a history of refreshed qualifications can be maintained.
An new business focussed NFT application could show the portfolio of certifications and experience in categories that lend themselves to the roles being targeted. For example, formal degrees, seminars, courses, licences professional qualifications, published works etc. for a university role, or trainee certificate for a new apprenticeship role.
The NFT could be linked with an oracle API to provide support for linking with HR or recruitment systems. A link back to a work experience and qualification wallet could also be considered.
There are a large range of types of qualifications, certifications, licences etc that could be considered and added over time.
Expected essential functionality would be the support of the creation, verification/validation, acceptance of posted certifications/attendances, management of expired qualifications and history as well as certification renewals, and transaction history.
The proposal is to kick start the development of a suitable platform to support this business need through to a working alpha version to enable further development and support from the Cardano community. This supports the challenge through the serious application of NFTs to solve a real world problem that we have had personal experience with over many years. By building on Cardano we promote the Cardano network, and support its growth through the application of broadly usable and highly visible business application.  
The app would provide a portfolio view of the categories of verifiable history and certifications, similar to what some simple NFTs for art work do today. A model perhaps like wallet app paradigm that can present the NFTs in different portfolio groups based on what is required for the scenario. The solution would need to be abstracted from the underlying technology to provide utility for this broad business user base.
The proposal plan is to aim at an 8-10 month alpha release to prove the concept technically and test the acceptance of the utility of such a solution in a range of industries.
The outcome is to develop a commercial platform for use by both applicants and businesses. Widespread adoption should be achieved on Cardano in preference to Etherium ERC721 due to the potentially very high gas fees of a typical ETH NFT transaction – something that could severely limit the potential user base for this platform.
It is expected that the capability would be built over a series of Phases. Funding is being sort to help kick off the project (Phase 0).
Phase 0 – Discovery (Months 1-3)
• Explore concepts, flesh out proposed user experience, test assumptions and ideas. Identify partner businesses.
• Budget: $10K USD
• Outcome:
o designs and interaction models,
o proofs of concepts
o developing an end user acquisition plan.
Phase 1 – Initial Categories (Month 4-5)
• Certified work experience
• Certified participation/attendance
• Budget: No funding at this time
• Outcome:
o Working functionality for work experience creation and verification
o Working functionality for certified participation
 
Phase 2 – Second round categories (Month 6-7)
• Certified course completion
• Certified formal qualifications
• Identify alpha business scenario partners
• Budget: No funding at this time
• Outcome:
o Working functionality for course completion
o Working functionality for formal qualifications
 
Phase 3 – Alpha release (Months 8-10)
• Recruit alpha testers and release workable alpha for field testing
• Refine alpha release based on feedback
• Refine end user acquisition and app growth plan
• Seek further investment based on the feedback from the field tests
• Budget: No funding at this time
• Outcome:
o Acquisition of at least 10 alpha business testers
o Working functionality on web, iOS, Android (in the form of an alpha)
o Roadmap for the remainder of the project
Remaining features could include (as ideas) – renewals, extensions, time limits, disposal, licenses, bridge to ERC 721 NFTs (if required) and other objects identified in the discovery stage and after discussions with business scenario partners
Outcome – a new app + NFT platform that provides a indisputable history of a prospective candidate that includes verified certifications, qualifications, work experience, professional licenses as NFT's on the Cardano network that can be easily created and maintained by the NFT owner and verified by the appropriate verification authority.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano has a unique opportunity in the NFT space to extend the current primary use of ownership to utility or some function of repeatable use / transaction of NFT's due to the fixed fee + data transaction model. I believe that using NFT's to gate access to future content can help athletes provide more than speculation to their digital assets. 
Why athletes?
July 1st of this year, Name Image & Likeness (NIL) rules were drastically changed allowing athletes in the US university and college level accept money for their participation in college programs. This has opened up a wild west that also allows for the legal transaction of NFT's for collegiate content before these athletes ever go pro. 
Ultimately we want to help create new ways for athletes to partner with university programs to create shared NFT's that bring new sources of revenue to universities after the athletes have left (NFT royalties vs only donations) while rewarding athletes value they deserve while in college. This will also help athletes choose smaller schools where more gameplay = more NFT highlights over second string at power schools. 
Where we are starting
There are many stages of athletes but we are starting with 6 - 10 Pilots that will mint the first collection of ""Throwback"" NFT's which take a historical highlight from an old school, home video, and pair it with a new clip of the athlete reliving that moment. This establishes ownership and a genesis point to show universities & schools we can create a new shared revenue pipeline with them and their former athletes using their existing content. This is underway and paves the way for this proposal.
 
Work completed to date
- Quicc has an engine to search and modify content based on transcription and other video metadata allowing for rapid (even programmatic) video creation of clips.
- Cloud infrastructure and core video management tech in market for 2 years.
- Active and committed pipeline of current, & former pro athletes and their universities creating NFT content.
 
Scope of FundingThere are many simple NFT's that are already minted and created on the Cardano ecosystem. The focus for this funding is to create Smart Contract Templates for other developers who want to create multi-owner NFT's. As we know there is a significant impact with Smart Contracts that pass down to new owners of NFT's while passing ""acceptable"" royalties back to the school + athlete or any other stakeholder for many utility or transaction use cases in the future it's important to spend time planning a set of standards and stakeholder behaviors to prevent devaluation of early but flawed NFT's.   
1 Stakeholder (schools & athletes) behavior
- Create standard interview method for defining stakeholder behaviors (20 hours)
- In a sports use case, identify use cases, examples, stakeholder behaviors through interviews with our industry relationships. (60 hours)
- Examine the game theory behind the primary use cases to establish proper incentives. (120 hours)
- Finalize the primary expected outcomes as behavior templates (expected needs, outcomes, barriers) to determine Smart Contract template needs. (40 hours)
 
2 Open Source Smart Contract Templates
- Create open source smart contract templates for multi owner NFT's with clear documentation on Stakeholder types, value distribution ratios, and long term transaction royalties in Plutus. (250 hours) 
- Create and manage a git repo for community feedback and open source contributions (50 hours)
 
Total hours - 540 *main criteria for funding (including paying collaborators) 
 
Measurables
To define the success of our scope, the following will be the success baseline:
- Onboarding 2-3 more Plutus Pioneer Devs from the community.
- Interview 12 schools & 12 athletes to create stakeholder behavior templates
- Create game theory models based on possible incentives based on number of stakeholders (agents) a part of an NFT
- Setup git repo for Smart Contract drafts
- Finalize Smart Contract Templates for primary use cases & needs defined in Stakeholder behavior research.
- Town hall updates
 
**EXCEEDING
- 10+ community Plutus devs contributing to git repo
- Interviewing 15+ schools & Athletes to define stakeholder behaviors
- Covering use cases for Highschool athletes, College athletes, and Pro athletes

Total timeline for this to be completed is expected to run through the end of Q1 2022 with all deliverables due the first week of April 2022. 
 
After 3 months I expect to be done with school & athlete interviews, wrapping up game theory analysis and have most of our behavior templates ready for final review. We will have also have selected 2-3 Plutus Pioneers to collaborate with on the smart contract development.
 
After 6 months I expect to be nearly complete with the final Smart Contract Templates and finalizing any outstanding edge cases though the git repo.
 
After 12 months I expect there to be 100+ forks of our Smart Contract Templates to be used in other Cardano multi-owner NFT projects. 
 
Expected Impact for the Challenge
I expect that this research will not only show the value of NFT's on Cardano as low cost way to uniquely identify ownership over a joint licensed piece of content, but provide a new way for these schools & athletes to work together to support each other through new revenue sources from their fans and school supporters who want to give back to their school and the athletes with every trade of the collectible NFT's.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Adam and I think we can attract significant external users into Cardano by selling physical jetchicken (jetchicken.io) game card packs, while also leveraging the process to market and onboard new users to the Cardano ecosystem.
 
 
 The current jetchicken sales model entails users purchasing digital card packs for 15 Ada each via the jetchicken.io website. Each card pack includes x10 game cards represented by fungible tokens (with varying rarities), x2 dynamically generated world-unique jetchicken NFT cards, and x100 FREE spacecoins. 
 
 
 
 
 
The proposed jetchicken NFT business model would entail selling printed physical card packs that containing physical playing cards AND a special QR code that loads a website to offer the user a means to acquire free digital jetchicken card pack. The interface will also serve as a means to educate new (""external"") users and help onboard them with Cardano, while also enabling them to mint actual native asset token representations of the physical pack. 
 
 
 
 
 
Creating and testing such a system will enable an effective means for NFT game and/or token projects to both attract new users from outside the Cardano ecosystem while easily converting them into users of both the relevant NFT project and of Cardano.
 
How funds will be used:
 
 - build QR code web interface to display digital representation of package contents, enable users to mint tokens representing package contents on the fly ($15k)
 
 - design and build educational onboarding tool for ""external"" users new to Cardano wanting to participate ($5k)
 
 -  print, package, market and sell physical jetchicken card packs ($20k) 
 
Target public launch date: 2/15/2022
 
Definitions of success:
- after 3 months the target business model initial pricing and token redemption processes will be ironed out, along with achieving outlines of the target onboarding process for new users
- after 6 months all deliverables will have been met, marketing / promotion will be actively underway, physical packs of jetchicken will be selling, and ideally with prominent distribution established
- after 12 months we would like to see 1M+ jetchicken users, and inspire many projects to leverage similar models
 
Adam Dean (BUFFY) and Kyle Solomon (FROG / WOLF) are both seasoned Cardano stake pool operators, developers and community contributors. We are the creators of spacecoins and jetchicken.

The focus of this project is the use NFTs for 2D and 3D Models in Architecture, Engineering Plans and Scientific Illustration.  Based on input from working architects, engineers and science illustrators, we will present a collection of use-cases and articulate a set of requirements developers should take into account when building dApps for 2D and 3D works. NFTs hold the promise of giving new life to the past works of architects and illustrators. Many of these works are currently filed away in drawers and on the hard drives of their creators. As a result, they are inaccessible to a larger audience. Encoding the works as NFTs will protect the intellectual property of the creators and make them more widely accessible. Our aim is to lay the groundwork for a burgeoning market in the trade of these NFTs on the Cardano ecosystem.

Can you articulate the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state? 
Given the below challenges in the current wallet environment I've experienced first hand and from most other new and existing users I believe the entire ecosystem would benefit from education and collaboration.
Current wallet environment limitations:
The Yoroi wallet mobile app does not function as designed after storing approximately 150 NFT's. It also lacks the ability to view NFT images or to send multiple tokens at once. 
The Nami Wallet environment lacks a mobile app as it is browser extension based, meaning dependency on other software. 
The Deadalus wallet environment also lacks a mobile app, as well as not being able to view NFT images. Extensive load times to synch when not left running is also a roadblock to adoption. 
A branded mobile application that addresses the above challenges will be a major driver in positioning Cardano as the blockchain of choice for NFT based businesses. 
End state 
An ongoing and evolving onboarding and training process to help reduce the friction involved with learning the Cardano NFT ecosystem and be a sort of incubator for future projects.
Additional areas to explore for future roadmap of NFT business services
NFT virtual showroom integration
Research into potential use cases with NFT frames type hardware that showcase NFT drops and collections
Automated NFT & token sales via vending machine services.

Fees typically include service fees, convenience fees, ticket fees, order processing fees, printing fees if printed at home, shipping costs for physical tickets, facility fees and taxes. In many cases Artists/Performers typically secure between 20% and 40% of the overall sum of a ticket price and generally have to wait more than 7 days for a payout from larger events/tour dates.
Event creation deploys a smart contract on the platform which users will interact with during transactions for that particular event
User buys a ticket > Smart Contract mints cNFT as a proof of purchase mechanism > User attends event with QR code for in-person or application authentication for streamed event > Smart Contract burns cNFT as proof of entry/access mechanism.
All of the Smart Contract behavior (cNFT minting/burning/authentications) take place on the back end. No wallet required for event attendees and no custodial issues for the cNFT's themselves. Event creators are paid to connected wallet (Nami, Daedalus, etc) in full at the moment of ticket redemption. 1% Platform fee + associated minUTXO's are subtracted at time of ticket purchase.

Problem Statement (continued)
With blockchain and NFTs surging, the interest for new ways to use blockchain both for new features as well as new business models is continuing to grow. There is a disconnect between the old and the new. The traditional way for how both ""Triple-A"" and indie companies design their games to be fun while being profitable vs the new, emerging ways of designing games with NFTs/Tokens has a vast gap of knowledge. While the video game industry generates more revenue than music and film combined, the business models in the game industry vary drastically and it can be daunting to start new game projects or companies that introduce a blockchain element.
The video game market is bigger than music and film combined [1] yet NFTs have just in its infancy. ""The Q4 release of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S sealed a year of record-breaking growth. We now estimate that the games market generated $177.8 billion in 2020, up +23.1% year on year, the highest growth for the Market since Newzoo began tracking revenues in 2012."" [2]
There are a few key problems when thinking about blockchain in games:

With several existing go-to business models that traditional companies are used to, how do we propose to introduce NFTs, tokens, or other decentralized technologies to drive mass adoption in a way that we can leverage and improve on existing models
What creative business models are there that are yet to be explored. Can they improve on what players/users are used to? Is it a brand new experience? How disruptive is it to the user? Is it a mass-scalable model?
 It is hard to evaluate if the current business models in some crypto games are thriving because of the crypto hype or it will sustain long term
How games design and monetize is mostly outside looking in and speculative of how game development actually works and then it soon comes as a shock to new teams the troubles that actually lay ahead
Market research is typically very expensive!

Describe Your Solution To The Problem (continued)
We have assembled a diverse team with a veteran advisory board with years of experience at gaming company titans such as Epic Games and Riot Games (see full list below). Paired with our team of executives from the tech industry, marketing professionals, and game development experts; we are poised to dive in and find the biggest opportunities within the gaming industry for Cardano to find mass adoption.
To accomplish this, we shall first perform in-depth market research on the gaming industry as a whole. Seeking and assessing the opportunities for NFTs and Cardano to make an entrance into the market. The market will be assessed based on segmentation (Physical Copies, Microtransactions, Subscriptions, P2P Marketplaces, etc..)
Thereafter, each segment will be analyzed and undergo deep market research. Our team of business experts, market researchers, and game developers will collaborate to create viable business plans that will execute upon the opportunity within the segment.
Upon completion, we anticipate releasing 10 business plans with the following general outline:
• Segment Overview 
• Market Research
     • Market Size
     • SWOT Analysis

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We will open the first Cardano-NFT gallery, where guests will buy tickets with ADA (or fiat which is immediately exchanged to ADA by us as Cardano is not used by everyone). While walking through the exhibition, the visitors will be able to vote for their favorite NFTs. Hereby a part of their entrance fee will be distributed by smart contracts to the artists whom's pictures the visitors vote for. Furthermore, a percentage of the voting results goes to the NFT-owners. Thus, the money allocated to the votes will be distributed to the holders but also creators of NFTs, and thus allow the artists to receive money from people enjoying their art while also encouraging others to buy and display NFTs in Cardano Galleries. 
Detailed plan:
3 Months: 
Develop the voting system and Apps for this system. Get in contact with museums / galleries to find a spot and timing. Buy screens to show the NFTs.. Meanwhile contact NFT-creators and owners if they want to participate with their NFTs.
6 months:
Open the exhibition for the public in live in Berlin, but also virtually online.
12 months
Evaluate the project, expand the gallery, possibly allow auctions of NFT / sale of NFTs within the gallery. Open up further galleries in other cities / move to another city.

Encode complex legal aspects of intellectual property rights into a NFT. Start NFT platform for IP transactions. Increase IP user community.",4,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 01:18",Richard Nugent,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Richard-Nugent/3099969-48088,Jure Tomc,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Jure-Tomc/3100056-48088,195000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Below is some basic information on the proposal, we also attach an initial and indicative Business Model Canvas.
Major problems of IP transactions are speed and cost. Our proposal aims both to reduce the transaction times and the cost associated with intellectual property transactions. Our platform will make it easier for smaller IP owners (e.g. SMEs, Universities) to transact using their IP and in this way benefit from the fruits of their labour. For clarity this proposal relates to IP that exists already, we are NOT proposing a platform to register new IP. Instead we propose an IP and intangible assets transaction platform.
Key phases include:
Ownership
Ownership of the IP needs to clear before it is associated with a NFT. Ownership of a NFT in a wallet demonstrates ownership of a non-fungible token. Ownership of the private key for the wallet holding the NFT shows ownership of the token. A smart contract and/or platform terms will be necessary to enable a NFT to be associated with and to represent the actual legal asset / rights as well as to convey either title or a licence. 
As part of verifying ownership the platform will use KYC and AML processes before NFT is minted or sold. We expect most IP assets will have a value which requires AML to occur for the platform to be compliant (due to the financial value). NFT buyers will want KYC to have a clear chain of ownership. AML will be needed and desirable to avoid money-laundering. It also ensures the reputation and brand values of the platform. 
Validation
A platform to check funds exist for transaction and to transact once everything in place. We expect software exists in the Cardano ecosystem already for this type of functionality. We understand from recent tonw-halls that this is also developing and improving. 
Deal
A platform for minters to choose a contract template - for simple transactions, or a place to store (e.g. on IPFS/similar) data associated with a more complex transaction. Most IP contracts are not simple. Deal structure development work is needed to ensure that IP and intangible asset contracts (which will end up as smart contracts) can be as varied as necessary to meet the varying needs of contracting parties. In the first instance we will focus on straightforward IP sales but in time we plan to migrate to more complex transactions such as licences. In the future we would seek to develop a platform which uses not just ADA but also e.g. DAI, ETH, HBAR, SOL, and allows for interoperability - I buy a ADA NFT and sell if for DAI or vice versa. We recognise many users may wish to exit quickly into a stablecoin following an ADA transaction.
Free of charge element
Whilst most of our product is expected to be for value we also want to give rights owners the ability to gift their IP, or the right to use it, to others, with those giving the access in some cases even choosing to absorb the transaction cost. We want to make it easier for IP owners in developed nations to enable those in less developed states to access developed nation IP - and to develop relationships with the communities in those countries (right now this is really hard). This will increase access to knowledge and access to IP. We also wish to offer reduced cost services to companies in LDCs (as defined by the UN) in particular. For clarity our model will avoid a tragedy of the commons situation from arising. We do not expect much interest in this part of the platform - as there needs to be people and infrastructure to receive IP and in our experience to date often this does not exist (we want to help this change), however we are open to work with countries and their organisations to facilitate greater use of IP and intangible assets. For clarity this is not for IP dumping to make donors look good for transacting low value IP (e.g. Easy Access IP), but more to enable transfer of IP/IA of value - Humanitarian Access Licensing. The approach of Creative Commons is valuable here. This feature will not be our core focus but one we wish to enable nonetheless. 
Community
We wish to build a community around our service. We see this as important. Communication via articles on medium and reddit as well as podcasts, videos and conference participation will help with this process. We have confidence that we can build a user community to use our services. The purpose of the platform is not solely to make revenue but also to add value to the communities with whom we work regularly. Both Totalinfo and JT Business Development have worked with numerous innovators from across the world over many years. As companies we have collaborated together on numerous occasions. With our platform we seek to make IP collaboration easier and deal flow faster.  However we are not the focus of any community rather it is the community itself.
Extra services
The platform will offer a range of additional services to support core platform activities. These will extend beyond platform services and into services that support the IP transaction e.g. due diligence, competitive intelligence, valuation, business development. Some services will be offered by our companies and similar and other IP and Business Development services will be offered through strategic partnerships. We have many relationships in regard to such services, whether in Europe (North or South), and other regions e.g. Africa, North and South America, South East Asia, China. That said we want to work with and collaborate with many more partners.
Competition - is this idea not obvious?
We know that this type of service has been mooted for many years (at least since 2015/16 if not before). We also recall 2017's LOCI coin, and other copyright registers during the ICO boom, and we are aware of others with an interest in IP and NFTs. This is a constantly developing space so we expect many companies will launch projects of this type. The world of IP is very large with many specialisms and we believe that there is room for many, many players in this space globally. We are open to collaboration. Comment on our proposal. Send us a direct message.
 
Funds
The funds we seek are for the early stage of our work. The costings are indicative at this stage. We expect the majority of funds to be spent on development costs. We are in discussions with other investors with a view to attract match funding (we have been developing this project for a while). If you are an investor we would be delighted to speak with you. We do not underestimate the challenges, complexities and costs associated with developing a system which will be robust enough to give users confidence to use it. 
Thanks for your attention. We look forward to hearing your (hopefully constructive comments (positive or negative) with great interest!
 
Expected public launch date
MVP launched on 1st February 2022
We wish to allow for time to create and deliver a proper product. If we can launch a more basic working product before this date we will.
How does proposal deliver on challenge metrics
The proposal will enable and allow for new certifiable transactions on the ADA blockchain
If funded the proposal will enable new utility on the Cardano blockchain and increase transaction volumes.
How does the proposal address the challenge
The proposal addresses the challenge by creating a new and more detailed smart contract format on the Cardano blockchain. This will enable detailed IP transactions to occur certifiably at speed and at scale.
How will success be measured after 3, 6, 12 months
Success will be measured by a launch in February followed by further platform developments and most of all the numbers of platform transactions growing steadily every month.
We expect the MVP to be functional after 3 months. A further 3 months will be spent on onboarding a few test clietns and testing the paltform's usability and functionality. Special attantion will be put on UX design to ensure a smootha and simple profess on the user's side.
In 12 motnhs we will have a fully operational platform with all major functionalities available. This will be time to start onboarding new clients and users to increase the database of IP available for transactions and to encourage IP users/buyers to start browsing the database in order to arquire licences and IP ownership.
What budget will be required
[to be confirmed]
IP ownership
The original intangible assets will be owned by the two companies delivering the platform. Much of the platform will be based on open source code and where code licence terms require sharing of some of our product on equivalent terms (e.g. under a GPL licence) we will abide by the terms of these licences. Our platform will be built on the shoulders of giants and we expect others will build upon some of the ideas in our platform. The idea of a smart contract is not novel or an IP platform is not novel, all that is novel is our implementation.
We will create and protect a new brand. This will be registered as a trademark in the UK and China in the first instance. Within 12 months of registration we will register the brand in other territories as appropriate e.g. EU, USA.

NFTs are the ideal way to tokenize premium content while distribution via blockchain is censorship-resistant. Creating a new content economy",4,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 00:49",Sebastian Pereira Gutierrez,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Sebastian-Pereira-Gutierrez/3056469-48088,,,28000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Plan in Detail
First, we should have some basic concepts down:
Content: In publishing, art, and communication, content is the information and experiences that are directed toward an end-user or audience. Content is ""something that is to be expressed through some medium, as speech, writing or any of various arts"".
Content creator: A person who derives most of his/her income from the creation and distribution of content.
Content distribution channel. The means a content creator uses to distribute his/her creations to a targeted audience or public.
Content economy: The economic activity that originates from the creation of content by content creators. The content economy went from less than one billion US dollars in 2016 to more than 13 billion in 2021.
Premium content: content sold for a monetary value that it's restricted behind a paywall. It could be a one-time purchase or using a subscription model. 
On average, the content economy has grown 30% year over year for the past decade. It has attracted enormous attention and it is one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy. There are over 19 million content creators in the US. Of them, 68% are under 35 years of age, and it keeps growing. 112 million US citizens have purchased at some point premium content from various platforms. 
Yet, there have been some problems with the current internet architecture and payment systems. Content creators are encountering a lot of friction:
Lack of ownership of their content: Since content distribution is generally done via centralized platforms, content creators do not own their work.
Piracy: current centralized platforms do not provide adequate protection against piracy or easy to verify ownership. Content is pirated easily, sometimes in less than 31 hours for popular content creators.
Content theft: lack of verifiable attribution leads to content online being stolen. 
High fees: current content distribution channels have very high fees. Places like YouTube and Twitch take between 55% and 45%. While Patreon and SubscribeStart take 20% to 25%.
Hidden fees: current platform use the legacy financial system for payment of content. This means that on top of the fees charged by the platform there are bank transfer fees, overseas transfer fees (if the public is outside the home country of the creator), and disadvantageous exchange rates when converting to local currency.
Censorship: content creator livelihoods are at the mercy of the platform.
Vague Terms of Service: are designed to be vague. The reason being that platforms want room for interpretation so they can apply ToS clauses discretionary and unfairly.
Our proposal
Most of the problems outlined previously will be solved by creating a decentralized content distribution channel. In fact, NFTs are the perfect model to allow content creators and audiences the ability to interact, support, and grow together. Some of the advantages are:
Ownership of content: NFTs and wallet addresses ensure content ownership is attributed to the deployer's wallet.
Different NFT use cases: NFTs can be used to sell galleries of content, cards, collectibles, and many other formats. This can help the content creator designing new monetization strategies and boost audience engagement.
Effective micro-transactions: Cardano's fee structure allows for the real transfer of small amounts of money. In the current system, content creators need a minimum money amount to accumulate before being able to withdraw.
No middle-man: there would not be any sort of payment processor dictating terms to the content creator or audience.
Censorship resistance: no centralized actor can ban a content creator based on arbitrary criteria.
The audience of the content creators would also be able to benefit via the use of the unique properties of blockchains:
Liquidity mining: The platform can ensure rewards via a native token to those followers that use their tokens to show support to a particular content creator. Like staking, but instead to a pool of DeFi vault, lock one's funds with a particular content creator. 
A secondary market for NFTs: Content creators that release their galleries using NFT can benefit from a secondary market where audiences trade them between each other. A portion of the re-sell value would go to the original creator. While people with native tokens on their wallets could have reduced fees, or even no fees, for trading on the secondary market. 
Social tokens: content creators can also issue fungible tokens that would benefit from a larger ecosystem. There would no be more rug-pulls because these would have value within the platform.  
Those are just some of the benefits and products that can be delivered via the Cardano network to those participating in the content economy. The value of bringing the creator economy to the blockchain is also immense.
We are talking of a new type of blockchain user audience that can complement proven use cases like DeFi. A gateway for the adoption of blockchain by the masses not through financial products by the entertainment.
Definition of success
The expected launch for the platform itself would be January 2022. But all the items in the first three months would be delivered in 2021.  
First 3 months:

Onboard content creators prior to launch.
Start community engagement via social media presence.
A first draft of the logic behind the smart contract's design.
An initial draft of the tokenomics for incentives.

Next 6 months:

Release the first tokenized content via NFTs.
Release smart contracts for NFT distribution.
Token sale to raise further funds.
Create new NFT standards that have different use cases (collectibles, fractional ownership, on-chain decentralized royalties, others).

Next 12 months:

Expand the platform to offer DeFi services.
Start the transition to a decentralized government structure.

Budget breakdown.

Smart contract and tokenomics design Cost = 30%
Developing costs = 50%
Publicity costs = 10%
Promotional costs =10%

Competition
The promise NFT holds for the creator economy has been recognized by other projects in different chains. The superior technology and higher security of Cardano would be better applied here. Some of the competitors are:

A brief note from 2030
The State of the Market is a famous painting which was created at the beginning of Goguen Era and has been updated since then by uncountable authors. The painting changed numerous times but each step of its evolution is recorded forever thanks to the everlasting blockchain of Cardano.
The initial creators, claiming to be members of a cryptic group named Catalyst Fund, divided a rectangular area into squares of pixels. For each of those plots an NFT had been created and auctioned. Then free circulation began, allowing owners to trade the tokens and — even more importantly — paint their plots however they fantasized.
An eternal contract allowed the painting process to last forever. NFT owners could do it any time they wanted, for a small fee, from which both the authors and the entire Catalyst Fund gained steady income. Each act of painting made another version of SotM generated, stored on IPFS and recorded into the blockchain with hash proving they were original.
Some of the NFTs were lost, burnt or otherwise withheld, making parts of the painting immutable forever, intentionally or not. However, the majority of the image remains in trade, making the entire digital masterpiece a testament of the early era of the cryptocurrency market.
Why?
The idea represents simplified property market based on blockchain and NFT. It visually proves these transactions could be fast, inexpensive and done without intermediaries.
History shows that both collective painting and blockchain games get viral and bring broad attention even from spectators or people who just read about it.
Technical and business details
A draft of the technical description follows. This is a descriptive text and I would like not to declare any numbers before the project starts and deep technical analysis will have been done.
However, some important things need to be declared.
Catalyst Fund remittance
The project will divert at least 10% of income back to the Catalyst treasury. These numbers will be guaranteed by the contracts handling auction and painting.
The painting process should start as soon as the first NFTs hit the market. Each operation will incur a minimum fee from the token owner, but will allow a higher payment as a form of donation to the authors and Catalyst Fund. All such income will be also subject to 10% remittance for Catalyst.
Planned functionality
Please note that Plutus is an emerging environment and perhaps no one could be called expert nowadays, definitely not me and probably not the people I'd hire to the team. Some of the declarations below might just be impossible or simply too costly to implement within the budget.
However, the following list is prioritized and in case that an item would prove impossible to achieve, the next one will be taken from the list.
Feature list

Division of the image area into plots and NFT emission,
Website presenting the image and choice of available plots,
NFT sale (auction?),
Single-plot painting,
Generation of new version of the image after each painting operation,
IPFS storing of each version of the image,
Other cloud backup storage,
Public contract allowing escrow for NFT trading,
Public contract allowing auctioning of NFTs,
Multiple-plot painting (directly on the image via browser?)
Monthly released timelapse video of the image history.
Painting by PNG file upload,

While points 1-6 are mandatory, I reserve the right to drop up to 2 features from points 7-12 should they prove too hard to implement.
Budget
The project requires input from at least 6 people, although roles may be split or combined:

2 backend developers (for blockchain and for web site) [6 months each, $70k/yr]
1 UX designer [1 month, $60k/yr]
1 frontend developer [3 months, $60k/yr]
1 graphics designer [1 month, $50k/yr]
1 tester [2 months, $40k/yr]

The devops part can be carried out initially by the team members. Then incoming revenue should finance growing demands for storage and image rendering.
The network fees for NFT creation, setting up initial auctions and other operations will be paid by the team.
Roadmap
The following dates are relative to the day of funding:

3 months: a raw MVP on testnet, with reduced image area, initial auction started and painting contract present,
6 months: the above equipped with features 1-6,
12 months: a mainnet version working and generating first revenue, NFT trading contracts present,
18 months: complete project as described in feature list above.

Defining success
The project success could be described in 3 stages:

good: it generates positive revenue,
very good: the above and the image changes at least once per day (someone paints),
outstanding: the project becomes mentioned and/or used as example in changing existing property trading laws.

Part of the bridge for Ethereum, BSC and Polygon is close to completion and is in final stages of testing now.
Router sending the information between blockchains needs 3 more weeks with testing.
Next step is to develop Cardano part, estimated at 4 weeks with unit testing in parallel with Router development.
2 weeks of integrated testing and the service is ready to launch.
So 6 weeks in total from the day starting developing on Cardano.
 
When the bridge is working, start developing nice and bright gallery where the migrated NFTs could be listed.
4 weeks end-to-end as art partner of the project already has a gallery, which will be used as a template to integrate crypto wallets/payments there.
 
Budget for a 6 weeks project:
4 additional developers for Cardano part - 72000 USD
2 dedicated testers, who will test and document results - 18000 USD
1 dedicated project assistant manager, who will help running daily scrums - 18000 USD
Bridge UI and initial gallery website - 12000 USD
Professional SEO and minimal marketing - 6000 USD in addition to already allocated private funds.
 
Tracking:
Plan shared 3 days from start.
Weekly report shared with the stakeholders and the community.
List of testing scripts with passed/fails status available online.
Code placed on GitHub every week.
 
Definition of success:
Bridge fully operational and launched. Intermediary measure not required on top of tracking steps due to short duration of the project. 
 
Public launch:
13 December 2021, taking Fund 6 timeline into account. The team would prefer to launch 11 October 2021.

Leveraging NFT's and Cardano, we want to create a system that rewards supporters while growing the industry.",+,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 22:50",Nixon Ng,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Nixon-Ng/3095831-48088,,,5000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


**What is Dionysus?**
Dionysus is known as the God of Theatre and many other things, as such we only see it appropriate for us to use Dionysus as our name. Dionysus aims to help alleviate financial burdens on the performing arts in the short term and the long-term goal to help support growth for the infrastructure and education of the performing arts. We hope by leveraging cryptocurrency and NFT's, we will create more awareness and encourage the public to enjoy watching theatre while helping the industry.
**PAC Treasury**
One of the two core components that Dionysus consists of is the PAC Treasury. Which stands for ""People, Arts, Community"". Using a similar system to the Catalyst Fund, we want to allow people to propose projects and be guided by mentors to successfully request said funding. A simple example would be if Bob wants to put on a show, but can't afford to pay for both the actors and a venue. Bob can then create a profile for his production and pitch it to the community to vote on (will explain this later on).
With any luck or an amazing proposal, a successful vote will have Bob receive funding directly from the PAC Treasury into the production's wallet, which will allow the public to view where the funds are going as we try to be as transparent as possible. Any funds placed into the PAC Treasury will only be allowed to leave the PAC Treasury following a vote.
If funds were given to the production, they must use our NFT ticket system and a small portion of sales will be channeled back into the Treasuries and DIO Pool. The PAC Treasury funds can only be moved through votes and nothing else.
**DIO Token**
DIO (a fun play of words for Dionysus and the Spanish word for God) is the second core component and also our native token. We plan to have DIO as our main token/currency to be used in all transactions, and holders will have the opportunity to stake their DIO to receive rewards from the DIO Pool. Staked DIO will receive voting power for both governance and funding in Nysa.
**Nysa**
Nysa was where Dionysus was raised, and Nysa will also be our ""Catalyst Fund"" where producers and others will ""raise"" proposals to be voted on. Here we are hoping to find a strong community of advisors from the industry to help give advice creatively, or in the production aspect to help raise production value as a whole. This is so we can achieve our goal of growing performing arts, not in just funding, but also in education in certain aspects of the industry.
We are also considering allowing delegated votes for our advisors, so if you have an advisor you trust you may delegate your votes to them. But they are barred from voting on projects they are currently advising, but this may change through governance. We aim to onboard advisors who have a strong background in producing and/or directing to get the best solution. We have a strong relationship with a performing arts school, and we will use that to our advantage to kick things off.
**DIO Pool**
Over time from our fixed supply, we will release or ""mint"" tokens into our DIO Pool. DIO holders will have the option to stake DIO to receive rewards from the DIO Pool. All transactions in our NFT Marketplace and from Ticket Sales will have a small % channeled into the DIO Pool to be distributed as well, while the rest of the transaction fee will go to the ADA Treasury and the PAC Treasury. This is to ensure that all funds are being used to maintain and build the treasuries which will be given back to the ecosystem. Once the max supply has been reached, transaction fees will be used to reward stakers.
**ADA Treasury**
The ADA Treasury will store our ADA needed for the Dionysus ecosystem. The treasury will be used to pay for any ADA required to do transactions on Cardano. A portion of transaction fees from the Marketplace and Ticket Sales will also be sent to the ADA Treasury to pile on more funds to further maintain the ecosystem. If there is any excess in funds, we will use it appropriately on anything that will benefit Dionysus' growth (future hires, advisors, regulation checks for different countries, frequent audits). We want to ensure full transparency.
**D-Tix(temp name)**
D-Tix is our idea for NFT tickets. In the future, we would like to have designers get involved in creating these tickets, as this will add artistic and collector value to the tickets, and give you that extra special feeling of owning something unique.
To further incentivize D-Tix holders, we will have small benefits and incentive programs for D-Tix holders as they're directly supporting the industry by purchasing and watching shows. But these benefits aren't large enough to game the system, as we want people to genuinely watch and enjoy these shows and truly support the industry. There's no point if shows are sold out and nobody watches, it defeats the whole purpose. A portion of ticket sales will be channeled back to the treasuries.
We believe with the pandemic still at full throttle there will be countries that will have to turn to online theatres, and our ticketing system will help in creating marketing and new traffic for these theatres.
**NFT Marketplace(temp name)**
The NFT Marketplace will be a platform where users can trade their NFT's. Such as the NFT tickets you bought to watch a show. We would also like productions to leverage our NFT platform to sell maybe NFT versions of Cast Recordings Albums, Program Books, and other merchandise. There's just so much potential in NFT's and with theatre and the performing arts, there's a whole world for people to explore with NFT's in such a creative industry. 
 
**Roadmap**(WIP)
Phase 1: Training - Q1 2022
In Phase 1 we are going to use our funds to enroll both our developers into the Cardano Developers Programs (Associate & Professional). We want to ensure that our developers will be able to fully understand the Cardano system and be able to build a secure and efficient ecosystem that matches our passion for the performing arts industry. We wish to secure 5000$ as we are not sure whether we'll be able to secure the funds for the Introductory price, and any remaining funds will be used to build our branding.
Our goals:
1. Completing the Cardano Developers Programs
2. Minting DIO tokens
3. Creating the Treasuries and the DIO Pool
Budget: $5000
If we're lucky to get the Introductory price then we will allocate $2000 to the program for both developers, and we will seek a web developer to create our website, and a graphic designer to help with our branding and infographics with the remaining funds.
We are hoping that even if we miss the Introductory price $5000 would be enough to put our developers through the program. If $5000 isn't enough we will pay the excess ourselves.
 
Phase 2: Staking (Testnet v1.0) - Q2 2022
In Phase 2 in future Funds, we hope to request more funds to support our developers in further developing Dionysus, and by the end of Phase 2 we aim to release a Testnet that will allow our supporters to test our initial app. This will include staking a test version of DIO and testing our rewards protocol.
Our goals:
To fully develop the DIO minting, staking, and rewards protocol and launch our first Testnet.
Phase 3: Nysa (Testnet v2.0) - Q2/Q3 2022
In this phase, we will begin the development of the Nysa proposal site and release our second Testnet which has interaction with DIO staking and the voting protocol.
Our goals:
To have a Testnet version of Nysa working with voting protocol and a stretch goal of delegated voting if time permits, or we may postpone delegated voting to after Mainnet launch when we fully onboard advisors for a period of time.
Phase 4: NFT Marketplace (Testnet v3.0) Q4 2022
Phase 4 will be where we begin the development of the NFT Marketplace. This will be followed by our NFT minting that includes tickets, program books, music files, and more.
Our goals:
By the end of Phase 4, we want to achieve having a Testnet which has operability with our NFT Marketplace and minting system. There will also be a marketplace interface that'll be used to test the buying/selling/trading of NFT's and the transaction fee protocol to distribute fees to the treasuries and pool.
Phase 5: Mainnet Prep (Mainnet) Q4 2022
After Testnet V1.2 is successful and running as expected we will then request funds for a full audit to ensure Dionysus is working as it should. Our code will be open-source, and if our developers did a good job where the audit finds nothing critical with our code, we will then proceed with Mainnet launch.
After Mainnet:
We plan to integrate a DEX to allow in-site swaps for a better user experience.
We will expand on all parts from the top to bottom once we have a domain up and running, and will begin writing our whitepaper during Phase 2. By the end of Phase 2, we may have a Litepaper, but by Phase 3 we will have a full whitepaper written. Tokenomics are still being discussed, so stay tuned.

How my proposal impacts the challenge:
- Increases the entrepreneur / business owner userbase onto Cardano blockchain
- Increases NFT collections being launched on Cardano that have a positive impact on society
- Longevity of userbase through community token distribution and holders.
 
Roadblocks the project intends to address for the average entrepreneur who is not currently a Cardano user:
- Knowledge of blockchain 
- Knowledge of NFTs 
- Knowledge of use-case for Community Tokens 
- How businesses can use blockchain technology and digital assets as a launchpad to impact employee morale, improve brand image, increase revenue, attract top talent, increase customer loyalty and impact local community
 
Our solution:
Create an easy framework for entrepreneurs and businesses of all size to integrate blockchain technology and real world impact through the creation of mission-driven NFTs. Socialgiving.io is catering to companies that haven't yet declared OR would like to revise or get more specific on their social impact to society. (Social Giving Strategy)
78% of Americans expect companies to go beyond making profits; they must also positively impact society
Our goal is to make an easy to follow process for business owners to get noticed by millions of new potential customers and the company's existing community of raving fans through a fun, creative collection of digital assets called NFTs (representing a social stand)
ALSO
As part of the socialgiving.io site, each company will be issued our $ESC Community token(s). There are currently 50MIL ($ESC) tokens minted on the Cardano Blockchain and a portion of those will be airdropped to new members. The value of this token will depend on numerous factors including the growth of the members, advocates of the site and new NFT successful launches.  Essentially socialgiving.io becomes a consulting firm to businesses who need guidance and simplistic instruction on innovative ways blockchain can grow their their customer base. 
To show by example, the first unique collection of 100 mission driven NFTs (WheelzUP NFT) will launch September 30 on Cardano.  The WheelzUP NFT holders will vote on one single mission that will be carried out by the socialgiving.io founders.  (thus showing by example how the entire process works).  The mission that is voted on will be documented and completed and the community of holders will have had a part in that impact.
 
A conversation for any business owner:
If I looked up your company (whether you are a one man/woman show or a large business) would I be able to tell quickly what social impact I will make by buying your product or service or by hiring you? What are you doing for society and why should I choose you if you are doing nothing? If you are doing something is it in the forefront of your marketing? when I press the ""BUY"" button, do I step away from the computer and say ""man, I really love that what I just purchased is going to help fight animal cruelty?"" for example
OR
Is your social impact story so hidden that no one has a clue what you stand for ?
Why not create a collection of NFTs that help get the word out (i.e. your mission) and launch them on the blockchain for sale...you can donate a portion of the sales to your mission.. or you can agree that when a certain number of those NFTs are sold you will go perform some mission of your own as a company and the people who bought the NFTs get to decide what you do based on a vote.

Through regulatory-approved tokenization, we will reduce the cost of housing by 49% while maintaining overall value at the market rate.",6,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 22:23",Stephen Cameron,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Stephen-Cameron/3055516-48088,,,120000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Please read the whole proposal on my website: https://leveltransact.com/cardano-affordable-housing-solution/ 日本語で利用可能
 
-- THE SHORT PLAN IS BELOW --
I want to enable builders and developers to efficiently tokenize their housing units using a combination of a non-fungible token (to represent the asset) and fungible native tokens to represent ownership, all governed by a limited autonomous organization (LAO).
The LAO is essentially a U.S. based LLC that is created for each individual unit and governed not by a paper operating agreement, but a combination of smart contracts. A single NFT will be minted and tied in perpetuity to each unique housing unit and will in turn be owned by the LAO.
--- Cost of ownership is reduced by 49% (ability to rent/let as a 49% reduction too!)
--- Incentives to bring property information on-chain to increase value (repairs, improvements and other qualitative data)
--- Market value no longer directly tied to fiat/legacy method of valuation
--- A more fair and open marketplace for investment in real estate by all
 
USE OF FUNDS
--- Legal and financial framework creation, lobbying and filings will eat about 70k (58%) of the requested 120k in funds
--- Finishing the various smart contracts and escrow solutions I have already started in plutus/marlowe is another 35k (29%)
--- The remaining 15k (12.5%) will go to web/mobile app development to provide a sleek gui for everyone (think yoroi but on real estate steroids)
*No later than 5 years after this is developed, the whole thing will be open-sourced
 
MILESTONES AND METRICS
--- All the smart contracts related to that will be functional by the 3 month mark, so we can begin the harder work of stress-testing and QA
--- In tandem with development, all our legacy/off-chain legal contracts, agreements and how they will integrate with our smart contracts will be ready at 6 months (properly qa'ed smart contracts and web/mobile gui's will be 90% ready too)
--- In the run up to the 12 month mark, bugs will get squished and I will implement this in my development in Toronto, along with a few hand-selected developments by other like-minded builders in markets like New York, LA and SF to really prove our use case.
 
PLEASE READ MY FULL PROPOSAL to see all my credentials and what makes this proposal different from others: https://leveltransact.com/cardano-affordable-housing-solution/
 
------ 日本 ------
問題-現在、政府の要求によってのみ、手頃な価格のまたは社会的な住宅を提供するための金銭的インセンティブはありません。
 
ソリューション-規制当局が承認したトークン化により、市場価格で全体的な価値を維持しながら、住宅のコストを49％削減します。
 
-短い計画は下にあります-
ビルダーと開発者が、（資産を表す）代替不可能なトークンと所有権を表す代替可能なネイティブトークンの組み合わせを使用して、住宅ユニットを効率的にトークン化できるようにしたいと考えています。これらはすべて、限定された自律組織（LAO）によって管理されています。
LAOは基本的に米国を拠点とするLLCであり、個々のユニットごとに作成され、紙の運用契約ではなく、スマートコントラクトの組み合わせによって管理されます。単一のNFTが鋳造され、それぞれの固有の住宅ユニットに永続的に結び付けられ、LAOが所有します。
---所有コストが49％削減されます（49％の削減として賃貸/貸し出しも可能です！）
---価値を高めるために不動産情報をチェーンに持ち込むインセンティブ（修理、改善、その他の定性的データ）
---市場価値はもはや法定紙幣/レガシーの評価方法に直接結び付けられていません
---すべての人が不動産に投資するためのより公正で開かれた市場
 
資金の使用
---法的および財政的枠組みの作成、ロビー活動、およびファイリングは、要求された12万の資金の約7万（58％）を消費します。
---私がすでにプルタス/マーロウで始めたさまざまなスマートコントラクトとエスクローソリューションを完了することは、さらに35k（29％）です。
---残りの15k（12.5％）は、すべての人に洗練されたGUIを提供するためにWeb /モバイルアプリの開発に使用されます（yoroiを考えてくださいが、不動産ステロイドについて）
*これが開発されてから5年以内に、すべてがオープンソースになります
マイルストーンとメートル法
---それに関連するすべてのスマートコントラクトは3か月の時点で機能するため、ストレステストとQAのより困難な作業を開始できます。
---開発と並行して、すべてのレガシー/オフチェーンの法的契約、契約、およびそれらがスマートコントラクトとどのように統合されるかは、6か月で準備が整います（適切にqaされたスマートコントラクトとWeb /モバイルGUIは90％になります）準備もできています）
--- 12か月のマークまでの間にバグが潰され、これをトロントでの開発に実装します。また、ニューヨーク、ロサンゼルス、 SFは私たちのユースケースを本当に証明します。

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We will plan a website comprising a tool to create bets as NFTs of e.g. upcoming events e.g. sport events or price bets for stocks / currencies at a future date, racing events, ... 
 
Users can then bet on the outcome of future events. Here the score of e.g. a sports game will be imprinted in the betting ticket NFT, adding more options on different betting rewards (simple ""who wins / up or down ?"" but also ""what will the score / stockprice be?"").  Which data to use for the bets remains open to the creator of a bet. 
Using smart contracts, bets will be created and opened by team members. Here the users can then place their bet. The bets will then be sold and can be resold on our website to other users even during the sport event, thus we will create a completely new secondary market for ongoing bets.
As NFTs are unique, we can easily track the ownership at the date when the bet ends, allowing verification while also distributing the outcomes automatically via smart contracts to the NFT holders. 
 
TIMEPLAN
3 Months
-> Build a website, explain the concept, gain attention and write smart contracts for creating bets and testing different scenarios internally. Milestone: Allow functionality on a testnet and a functioning website.
6 Months
-> Release the website with functional betting options and allow first Bettings to the place, either hosted / create by our team, or in close contact to the bet creators. Milestone: Perform bets and test multiple outcomes in a real world environment.
After six months LATEST the website will launch with full functionality for users and bet creators (under supervision by us)
12 Months
-> Open the website for creating bets for multiple collaborators and gain users. Milestone: Get the project automated and concentrate on enhancement and bug fixing. 
After 12 Month the bet creators functionalities will be completely automated too.
BUDGET:
9000 for one smart contract & backend devs for 6 months. 
7000 for a frontend (and backend) dev for 6 months. 
5000 for marketing and growth management & community / social media presence

Our mission is to build transparent participatory ecosystems for the film and video industry by connecting content consumers, creators, publishers, and investors through crowd based funding instruments built on Cardano.
The global video streaming market is forecasted to grow at a compound annual growth rate rate of 20.4% from 2020 to 2027, reaching USD 184.2 billion by 2027. Source: Grand View Research - https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/video-streaming-market
Currently this market is dominated by iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, Disney, HBO, and major Hollywood production studios. So how does one disrupt an industry that created such a sticky user-experience that the term binge-watching was created to describe consumer behavior?
The short answer is we tackle it in pieces. Independent content creators experience the biggest pain points. Funding projects is extremely difficult and seeing ROI only occurs after streaming platforms, distributors, and production houses all take their cut.
Presenting CineFund, an economic incentivized Decentralized Exchange for tokenized Unique (non-fungible) assets pegged to historic and real time performance of streaming content.
Creatives will be able to mint and sell NFTs that grant the owner access to future streaming residuals.  Funds raised would provide the creatives with the capital needed to produce the film.  Each person who takes part in the film creation process would have a collection of NFTs that represents their role (cinematographer, writer, director, etc) which in turn fit into the complete film collection.  Collectors will be incentivized to share and market the films which they hold the NFTs of.  The more views/sales that a film sees the more an NFT holder can earn in residuals.

Idea
Adaly Wallet allows exploring remote NFTs. Now we want to gather all the NFTs under a single gallery. We want to create a beautiful NFT gallery, that is fast. Being able to list the NFT's in real time makes the development of further services possible (challenge metric).
Technical
Decentralized loading of NFT files is slow as there is no central storage. Images are shared over a slow ""distributed network file system"" called IPFS. This slowness can be overcome by prefetching every distinct CNFT into a cache. We will create a concurrent multi-process IPFS pre-fetcher to seed this cache.
Funding
Funding will go into development of the prefetched NFT storage cache.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


NFTickets will become a tool for event hosts and institutions where tickets in any form are needed (entry, VIP, participation, ...). Tickets will be minted as NFTs native assets on the Cardano Blockchain.
 
Why NFTs?
Easy verification of the authenticity of tickets for secondary market and verification at the time of the event with the following advantages: 
This allows for organizers:

Easy setting max ticket numbers (if applicable)
Easy change of settings for future tickets, imprinting of the relevant parameters into the tickets Metadata
No need to sell minted tickets as minting can be made to be done by the user 
Simple verification of the authenticity of tickets using our WebApp

This allows for users: 

Easy resale on secondary markets (each CNFT markets)
Allows collection of tickets as unique souvenirs of special events / entries to exhibitions / travels / ..
Transparent sale

Roadmap
We will first develop a simple website which allows event organizers, or traveling companies to create ticket-NFTs via two different procedures. At the same time, we will get in contact with local ""crypto events"" as e.g. the local meetups of next Cardano summit meetings or online events. As Cardano is not established throughout the real world, we will work with event hosts to allow an ""optional sale through Cardano"" besides fiat. Here we thought of art exhibitions in Berlin for the beginning. Also we will try to get online event makers involved and also let the community suggest first cooperations. No contacts has been established now, but will be focused on as soon as funding is set. 
If you have potential partners for early usage  let us know in the comments
How will it work?
A) A limited batch of ticket NFTs can be minted on our webpage at once and later be distributed as preferred by the organizer. Here all aspects of the tickets (such as date, name of the event, type of event, location, time, ..) can be specified beforehand. This is suitable when the tickets are limited to a certain number and don't depend on participants names.
B) Alternatively, the organizers provide necessary information to allow the user to mint the ticket on their own while filling in a form with e.g. Name, country of residence, ... 
Possible options which can be imprinted into the NFT can then be:

Time until it is possible to mint,
Bonding curve,
Max ticket number (might also be unlimited for e.g. online events or train / bus tickets)
Which data is needed to be provided by the buyer (e.g. name, country of residence, time of travel, ...)

For each event, the event-participant will find a simple webpage, where he / she can buy or mint their ticket with providing datum if necessary. Via smart contract, which allows automatic processing of the NFT to the user, the money will be forwarded to the event-organizer and a small fee will be applied to our team. 
At the time of the event, the NFT can be verified by policy ID and metadata via Web application or mobile applications. 
What is our longtime goal?
Our goal is to finally establish ticket systems for different use cases and become a platform of trust for ticket sales for e.g. 

Festivals
Concerts,
Galleries and exhibitions
Auctions
Online Events (as Cardano Summits)
Courses (education)
Transport (Ferry, train, bus, plane
Museums 
Touristic tours and full travel packages
political summits
other political or social events of any kind 
contact us for further ideas, e.g. already having some organizer / company in mind which we might get in touch with

 
TIMEPLAN: 
First we will work together with a few companies and small event hosts, and later open up an automated option for companies to create NFTs-ticket sales without our review process.
-> within the first 3 months:
Create the smart contracts used, validate them and set up a webpage. Get in contact with potential event hosts.
-> within the first 6 months:
Create test events and mint first tickets / allow minting and testing of different types of tickets, establish connections to event hosts for events in the next 
-> within the first 12 months:
Host the first events and subsequently open up the platform for various event-hosts and users, distribute validation webapps / mobile application for event hosts and allow automatic minting and event hosting.
 
FUNDING:
9000 Plutus dev for 3 months. (me)
9000 Backend Dev for 3 months. (applications already received, but may be opened again after funding)
9000 Frontend Dev for 3 months. (application will be opened after funding is received)

The time after the three months will be funded by first ticket sales of early stages of the project, distribution of  utility tokens / Cardano crowd funding options.

To increase the recurring use of NFT's we propose a {prompt} + {punchline} word game where two NFT's are combined to ""win"" unique pairs.",3,"Wednesday, 25 August 2021 20:02",Jason Toevs,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Jason-Toevs/3079359-48088,,,21750,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano has a unique opportunity in the NFT space to extend the current primary use of ownership to utility or some function of repeatable use & transaction of NFT's due to the fixed fee + data transaction model. With this unique positioning it enables gaming in unique ways where transactions at scale can happen at low fees thus opening it up to more users and usage.
 
Why a game?
Creating a game with a tangible ""cash out"" option is our main focus. Can we show usage, create fun, and give players who want to recoup a portion of their investment, even if it's small, a way to do so. This will start by creating unique game play pieces as NFT's to be owned, then develop into usage within the game mechanics itself.
 
DUO (Images Attached)
The planned gameplay -
As with any game the first step is establishing fun, accessible, repeatable gameplay. I believe that the world needs more laughter, which is why the focus of this game is humor and word play. 
 
We will use a prompt card NFT to initiate each round of gameplay which can be paired with a punchline card NFT that creates a funny pairing between two unique NFT's. These are voted on by the players in the game to determine the winning combo. 
 
Part of the model exploration is defining how to use NFT's and Game Token(s) to create a balanced and sustainable game ecosystem. For example in this planned card gameplay each round will require a token from players to participate, mitigating abuse. Then each round will finish by distributing tokens to the winners. The questions we aim to answer with this proposal:
- What should the tokens accomplish in gameplay?
- Do you need multiple tokens?
- What seeding distribution ratio should be used for players:nfts when using these in game tokens?
- What are possible exploits?
- Where should game makers maintain centralized control?
 
Work completed to date

- First round of NFT artwork and game mechanics complete.
- Physical version of the core gameplay completed as a prototype for Alpha testers to provide feedback on. 
- Database of NFT content seeded with content ready to mint
- V 0.1 of Tokenomics to support gameplay drafted to supplement physical gameplay testing. 

 
Scope of Funding
As with any project, finding the minimal viable product is key at each stage of development. The focus of these funds if awarded will be community engagement & open source research. I intend on minting the initial gameplay pieces to fund ongoing development. NFT gameplay and balancing the game mechanics to create a fair and fun ecosystem needs development and testing. These time allocations are my limits to ensuring I can collaborate with others effectively to move the project forward and don't chase perfection.
 
1 Community

- Finalize current Alpha gameplay ruleset and distribute to 50 Alpha community testers for feedback. (20 hours)
- Tweak gameplay based on feedback (50 hours)
- Community for project description, providing feedback, alpha testing updates. ( 40 hours)

 
2 Open Source Research for other developers

- Research and document the tokenomics & NFT utility usage to model the foundation for a game economy blueprint that can scale globally. (100 hours) 
- Publish a public whitepaper of our findings & provide community updates for other game designers. (80 hours)

 
Total hours - 290 main criteria for funding (including paying collaborators) 
 
Measurables
To define the success of our scope, the following will be the success baseline:

- Onboarding 50 Alpha Testers.
- Setting up the community tools with 60% engagement (feedback responses) over the Alpha testing window. 
- Finalize Alpha rules & gameplay
- Collaborate with at least 3 other experts on game tokenomics & NFT usage to model out a core game economy - co-authors on Whitepaper.
- Publish resulting Whitepaper in Q4 2021
- Town hall updates

 
EXCEEDING Expectations

- Waitlist of more Alpha testers
- Alpha community engagement above 60%
- Publish Whitepaper in November 2021

 
Timeline
Total timeline for this to be completed is time boxed to Q4 of 2021 with all deliverables due before the new year. 
 
Phase 1 - Community site & Discord (~2 weeks)
Phase 2 - Alpha Tester signup and gameplay testing window. Concurrently doing research & documentation (~5 weeks) 
Phase 3 - Whitepaper & wrap up. (~2 weeks)
 
After 3 months I expect this to be fully delivered. After 6 months other developers using the blueprint in their own game economies. After 12 months active games improving on this model either open source or privately.
 
Expected Impact for the Challenge
I expect that this research will not only show the value of NFT's acting as a utility within a game, but establish a model (blueprint) for others to use in their own games with basic models for tokenomics + NFT usage. Further, I expect that this will also highlight the nuances of Cardano's eUTxO model and low network fee advantages to bring more game developers using NFT's into the Cardano ecosystem.

WILD NFT for Pets (those furry family members that have wild genetics!!)
        CASE 1:  Fund shelter animals!!  Help to ensure that any animal that finds itself in a homeless animal shelter will go to a safe forever-home.  WILD NFTs can help put an end to euthanizing healthy animals - making Cardano a key resource for animal care and compassion.
        CASE 2:  Pet Custodian NFT4NAT:  NFT4NAT which safely assures, with associated funding and a contract, that a pet owned by a senior (50+ years old) pet guardian will be safely transferred to and cared for at a no-kill animal shelter in the event that the senior pet guardian can no longer car for the pet. (Initial focus is N. America, where DignifID has already developed this model and associated contracts.)
 
Many other types of WILD NFTs will be developed by an enthusiastic global community interacting with our multi-lingual web portals.
 
WILD NFT will also provides mechanisms for market dynamics that enable WILD NFTs for environment and animal support to be acquired as investments that have sustainability returns AND financial upside potential.  If a CryptoKitty is worth $100k's - what might a WILD NFT for a protected lion be worth? We're going to find out!!

He who forgets his past is lost
(African Proverb)
 
African Culture
According to Wikipedia, African culture dates back hundreds of thousands of years.  At one point in history, Africa thrived and was considered to be the center of the world economically, culturally and in many other measures.  
There are many African stories and cultural impressions that have survived the test of time.  Moreover, there are new and compelling cultural stories being created across Africa and the African diaspora everyday.  African Cultural NFTs will capture the ancestral story as well as the modern day story in illustrations, story, and other expressions of African cultural story.
 
This is a Wada treasury project.  A percentage of the proceeds that result from the sale and resale of NFTs will be used to fortify the Wada treasury as a liquidity provider.  
Wada Treasury

Infrastructure projects
Education initiative
Other Wada priorities

Artist(s) will retain 0% - 85% from sale of the NFT (Artist incentives for funding the treasury).
Wada treasury will receive 15% - 100% of the sale (perpetual) of the NFTs through the Wada network.
 
Illustrations and Story
Artists will create illustrations that represent specific characteristics of African ethnic groups / tribes both on and off the African continent.  In some cases the illustrations will be accompanied by story. In other cases the story and / or the illustration might be delivered independently.  
We plan to offer several different NFT expressions (illustration, story, song, etc.)    
Interviews
We will conduct well-designed audio and video interviews with various communities. Stories, illustrations, etc. will be created based on such interviews and shared in various formats on various networks. The interviews will serve a few purposes.

Record for posterity on the blockchain.
Way to generate blockchain and technology use cases for Africa and other developing nations.
License the ownership of the the value wrapped in cultural story through NFTs
Value will be used to compensate interviewers, story subjects, and storytellers.
Value will be used as a financial input to Wada treasury for financing projects on the continent and in the diaspora.

Key Objectives:

Conduct research and develop architecture for building up a collection of stories to be preserved in the blockchain into perpetuity
Identify a mechanisms for weaving narratives through stories that speak to our higher aspirations
Identify ways to circulate the stories in various formats
Discover local technology uses cases based on insights gathered from stories
Forge a NFT architecture that captures the value of cultural story
Design an economic structure that compensates all contributors as well as finances Wada treasury.

Consequences:

Addon to the Wada membership portal that uncovers and preserves cultural history of Africa, diaspora, and other cultural representations

Credentials Trust Issue
In the blockchain world, in many applications, such as liquidity pool farming, token transactions, NFT negotiations, gaming, etc., it is not required to trust the other party since smart contracts exist to solve exactly the trust issue.
However, in some other applications such as an online, decentralized and open marketplaces, there may be a need to trust the other party if you are negotiating a service or any other good that needs expertise to be delivered. In these cases, there is a need for an extra step regarding trust. If you check an online certificate or credential, for example, it's not necessarily valid, and there are many examples of false credentials in many industries.
https://theconversation.com/fake-qualifications-are-on-the-rise-how-universities-can-manage-the-risk-109962
 
Certification NFTs
One way to solve this issue with the blockchain technology is by providing NFTs that represent valid certificates. The NFTs can be minted after the validity verification of credentials issued by trusted partners, such as universities, and these NFTs can guarantee the validity of one's credentials in a blockchain-based services marketplace.
 
Win-Win: an Alternative Dispute Resolution platform
Win-Win is an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) platform that aims at serving as a marketplace for mediators and their clients. Our main proposal in Fund 6 can be checked here: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Win-Win-Dispute-Resolution/368353-48088
In this application, it is essential that the clients can verify and trust the mediator's credentials, so they can be sure that they really are professional in that field, compare their options and choose the best fit for their case.
To solve the trust issue in this case, this proposal aims at providing NFTs as blockchain-based certificates for mediators using the Win-Win platform.
 
How will it work?

A partnership between the Win-Win team and a certification entity, such as a University, is made. One such agreement has been made with the California State University, Dominguez-Hills (CSUDH) that committed to certifying their alumni and graduates from the Negotiation, Conflict Resolution, and Peacebuilding Program (NCRP) going forward.
The certification entity receives NFTs to be sent to their qualified persons' wallets
The mediator proves his certification in the Win-Win platform and clients can trust his credentials when choosing a mediator for their case. The NFT credential becomes invalid if the NFT moves from the mediator's wallet.

Based on some initial feedback I have tried to make the idea a bit clearer
Our goal is to explore how to increase open collaboration and evolution of knowledge. We know evolving knowledge is crucial for helping us navigate change. In particular, we would like to explore the impact of receiving recognition (NFT) and in the future perhaps a reward (token) for contributing to the evolution of common knowledge. 
We have created an online space (guides.co) for people to explore and collaborate on common (contextual) knowledge. People are already sharing this knowledge in live documents (a guide). Currently each guide has 1 owner and a number of admins with edit rights, plus many users contributing comments and reflections to that guide. However the problem we see is that over time the evolution of the content significantly drops in these guides (even where we are sure the content could be still relevant).
We've identified that a problem is that having only 1 author is counter productive for creating a perception of shared ownership (""why should I help if it mostly benefits him/her?'). Of course the underlying assumption is that if you share ownership over something you invest more time in it and take better care of it. A first step would be to experiment with displaying multiple owners in a guide (see mock up attached), including designing and testing a process for becoming a co-owner. With thousands of guides and counting doing this at scale requires a decentralised and trusted process. This is where we think NFTs can play a big role.
A guide as NFT - shared ownership: Become a partial owner of the guide you have contributed to.
Every document (guide) is a unique NFT with every meaningful contributor being awarded a fraction of the ownership. As more people contribute the guide becomes richer and more 'valuable' and thus your part becomes more valuable. Contributing to different guides allows you to own parts of many NFTs. A user would build up a 'wallet'/portfolio of NFTs.
This project would explore 2 phases, where 1 lays the ground work for 2.
Phase 1
1a. How shared ownership should be experience most effectively, design and UI
1b. Design a collaboration process resulting in shared ownership that can be translated into an algorithm which can be repeated at scale
UX/UI Designer & Developer: $20.000
Phase 2
2a. A prototype to mint an NFT for each guide
2b Combining the collaboration process with awarding fractal ownership of an NFT
Design & development: $20.000
Project Management: $10.000
Total: $50.000
-------
Success after:
3 Months: Shared ownership design & experience, and a prototype of the contribution process that results in co-ownership
6 Months: Test the collaboration process at scale, and build a working prototype to mint a guide as an NFT and award ownership based on the contribution process.
12 months: Phase 2 of the project?
If there is time & budget left we would also like to explore the next phases in the project, such a as how NFT ownership could also lead to financial rewards. Next steps following this prototype could be connecting a KYC, testing the prototype at scale, integrate with a wallet, and making it available to all users. 
-------
Why we need a different kind of space to share knowledge? There are places online where people share knowledge, but these assume a question always has the same answer (wikipedia/wikihow), it's cloudy where knowledge comes from or repetitive (forums), limited in scope and application (not contextual), and/or don't reward the contributor (wikihow). 
What we think is missing is a place to navigate change together. We think if we can crack the link contributions-recognition - reward while leaving intrinsic motivation intact, open-collaboration could get a serious boost. Doing this project openly here and with the community allows us to share our experience with others so they can build on it and get a head start. 
-------
Why we think this will help the Cardano ecosystem? This project would explore how blockchain technology could help a relatively complex real world issue at scale (collaboration & shared ownership). It would also lay the first stepping stones for how this could link to more advanced applications of smart contracts such as DAOs. Either way we think it is definitely something very different from art or property NFTs.
Keen to hear your thoughts!

Not all brand owner loves the process of content production with content writer, there are a lot of problems that make them being exhausted. Including:

Waste a lot of time on feedbacking because content writer can't get their meaning. It's almost because of misunderstanding between them.
Brand owner loves the article made by content writer, but their target customer/ audience don't like it and make less interaction to their channel.
For owner that makes content by themselves, they don't have much time for updating trendy thing on society. That make their content so bored and less interaction.

On the content writer side, there are also many problems:

To content writer starters, professional content writing courses are expensive and take long time to learn. many of them also do not match with their persona that can cause them failed on study!
They have to take time for researching and following trendy for developing their ideas. This will limit their productivity.

Abstract
Explorie works like the popular game ""pokemon go"". Players roam around the world searching for NFT vouchers and collectables. Its mission is to be an NFT platform with real-life utilities. It seeks to encourage exploration and adventure. Users can download the Explorie app and venture outside their doors. Collectable geo-tagged NFTs will be available around the neighbourhood, which players can redeem. These NFTs can be in the form of vouchers from retail businesses such as restaurants, stores and theme parks, collectables such as limited edition digital pets as well as digital art. This serves as a marketing tool for businesses to drive foot traffic, while promoting health and wellness.
1 Background
The term ""NFT'' refers to non-fungible tokens, a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain. It certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore non-interchangeable. NFTs can be used to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to provide the owner with proof of ownership that is separate from copyright. The NFT market value tripled in 2020, reaching more than $250 million. During the first quarter of 2021, NFT sales exceeded $2 billion. Explorie would utilise NFT to help businesses drive foot traffic.
2 Problem
Businesses often find it difficult to market themselves to drive foot traffic. According to the US bureau of labor statistics [2], traditional businesses find it hard to market themselves to consumers. About 20% of small businesses fail by the end of their first year. By the end of their fifth year, 50% go under; and by the tenth year, that number rises to 80%. Traditional marketing methods have limitations such as high cost and being time-consuming. These problems can be solved with Explorie.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated businesses worldwide. These businesses include restaurants, theme parks as well as shopping malls. Prolonged lockdown and safe-distancing measures drastically decreased the foot traffic and revenue of these businesses, forcing them to shut down or pivot.
3 Why Cardano?
The founding members believe that Cardano is the most viable blockchain available in the market. It is the first blockchain with a research-driven approach. The sheer amount of academic rigour involved in creating Cardano is a guarantee for its integrity. First-generation blockchains such as Bitcoin paved the way for the industry. However, they did not create a functional environment for developing complex smart contract-based financial solutions. Second-generation blockchains such as Ethereum introduced smart contract capabilities. However, they suffer from significant scalability issues, resulting in network congestion and high transaction fees for users. On the other hand, Cardano is a third-generation blockchain that combines the former's properties and has evolved to solve this issue.
Ouroboros consensus mechanism
Ouroboros solves the greatest challenge faced by existing blockchains: the need for more and more energy to achieve consensus. Using Ouroboros, Cardano is able to securely, sustainably, and ethically scale with up to four million times the energy efficiency of bitcoin.
Babel Fees
Named after the Babel Fish from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the Cardano blockchain allows users to pay transaction fees using native tokens. Native assets on Cardano work as such: tokens are created and treated natively in the ledger with ADA. Instead of using the traditional UTXO (unspent transaction output) model presented by Bitcoin, Cardano's ledger has adopted the eUTXO (extended unspent transaction output) model which provides the foundations for Plutus. Utilizing this method we can have multiple different tokens (including NFTs) in a single transaction. We would utilise Babel fees after its implementation. Until then, we would stimulate the same process by paying transaction fees for our users.
4 Stakeholders
This part of the whitepaper will outline different stakeholders in the Explorie ecosystem and their respective user journeys.
Retail business
Retail businesses can utilise the Explorie platform as a marketing tool to drive foot traffic. They do this by issuing NFT vouchers. This can be done by setting up a redemption point in or near their stores. All they have to do is to display the QR code generated by the explorie app on tablets or smartphones. Players would be able to redeem NFT vouchers by scanning the QR codes using the explorie app. Each QR code is assigned to one new NFT issued, thus preventing duplication exploits. Alternatively, businesses can also open the Explorie app to scan a player's personalised QR code to issue the NFTs. This reduces the operating costs associated with needing to have a spare tablet or smartphone. Consumers can then spend the NFT effectively ""burning"" it. On top of NFT vouchers, businesses can also issue NFT collectables as well as art pieces. Compared to traditional marketing tools, Explorie provides several advantages to businesses.
Guaranteed foot traffic/high conversion rate. Since consumers have already made the effort to redeem the NFT vouchers physically, they are highly likely to spend those vouchers on the spot. A scenario is that hungry players would scan the Explorie app for possible food deals, and redeem the NFT voucher that would bring the highest utility/suit the player's taste preferences. They would then use those vouchers on the spot to purchase from businesses. This guarantees foot traffic to the store. Minimally, players would be exposed to the underlying brand and their products. Optimally, players will be converted to customers through sales. Having physically been to the store also reduces consumer resistance. This can be in the form of difficulty navigating to the store or a mismatch between product expectation and reality.
Low cost and effective marketing. Traditional marketing tools such as newspapers, TV and online advertising often are costly. Costing up to thousands of dollars. Their effectiveness is also inconsistent and is determined by several factors. Factors such as Ad quality, product type and Ad timing. The complexity of advertising often requires seasoned marketing managers who understand consumers deeply. They are able to create Ads that ultimately resonate with the underlying targeted consumers. Small businesses often do not have the expertise to achieve effective marketing, resulting in resources wasted without achieving promotional goals. Alternatively, they can hire Ad agencies or marketing consultants at a higher cost. Explorie promotes businesses for free through the browse function. This is where users can search the map for possible NFTs to redeem. In Explorie's pricing model, businesses are charged for minting new NFTs. Since voucher redemption is highly correlated to conversion, businesses essentially are only charged for successful conversions. This reduces the cost wastage associated with traditional marketing.
Time-efficient. Traditional social media marketing through content creation is highly time-consuming yet does not guarantee effectiveness. It is difficult to garner followings on Instagram, Facebook and Youtube. It often requires months or years of effort, carefully curating content to attract followings. Explorie solves that problem by providing an existing pool of users who are ready to venture out and collect NFTs. Thus providing businesses with potential consumers to be converted.
Business value
An average restaurant consumer spends $28.43 per visit in the US. The average profit margin for restaurants is 3-5%, resulting in an average profit of $0.85 to $1.42 per consumer per visit (Reimer, 2021). Consumers also have a chance to be converted to loyal customers who have an average lifetime value of $14,099 in a study done by Starbucks [1].
An average retail store consumer spends $40 per visit in the US. The average profit margin for restaurants is 0.5-7.5%, resulting in an average profit of $0.2 to $2.8 per consumer per visit [4]. Consumers also have a chance to be converted to loyal customers who have an average lifetime value of $22,200 [1]. These benefits are massive compared to the cost of minting NFTs which is just one EXP token per NFT.
Artists
Artists can use Explorie to tokenize both physical as well as digital artworks. They can then give these artworks away or auction them off through the platform. Explorie offers an intuitive user interface. Artists can easily upload an image to the app and it will be minted into an NFT.
Players
Players are users who collect NFTs using the Explorie app. They would first download the Explorie app in the app store, then create an account. Afterwards, a crypto wallet is automatically generated. Players can then venture outside their doors in search of NFTs. They would open the map interface where NFTs are displayed as icons. They can then select the NFTs they wanted and travel to the NFT location for redemption. Upon reaching the redemption point, they can scan the QR code provided to redeem the NFT. Explorie provides several advantages to players compared to traditional promotion platforms.
Transferable vouchers. Traditional E-vouchers are often restricted to the person intended. Oftentimes, these vouchers are left unspent due to neglect, resulting in wastage. The tokenization of vouchers using NFTs allows players to transfer, buy and sell these vouchers. Sometimes players might not want to spend the redeemed vouchers, they can then sell them for monetary profits in the marketplace.
Non-perishability. Traditional physical vouchers are susceptible to damage, making them a hassle to store. Once damaged, these vouchers are often voided as well. NFT vouchers are stored digitally in the player's wallet, making them non-perishable unless the player chooses to delete the app from their smartphones.
Transparent. Using the Cardano blockchain, NFTs minted can be traced and observed by everyone. This gives a level of transparency that is not available otherwise.

In Wooy we simplify and encourage donations using blockchain in a new and creative way, where we allow users to win once in a lifetime experiences with their idols while help causes that really matter.
We want to create a for-profit company that its objective is to help. Our vision is to use the technology to make an impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that is why we seek to work with non profits that are aligned with these objectives.
 
We plan on issuing NFTs or as we like to call them ""Proof of Donation"". We created the concept of PoD, taking the first step on the way to use NFTs beyond the monetary level and show transparency when donating, seeking to make this a standard. Where all the data of that transaction is recorded, like who donated, how much, when, to whom and for what, getting the full cycle of the payment, from user to use. We are going to give a PoD to everyone who has made a donation through us, giving trust again to the people who donate and eliminating one of the main problems we realized in our MVP.
So, what do we mean when we talk about once in a lifetime experiences?
For example, in our MVP campaign with the Red Cross we did an experience with Javier Calamaro, a musician from Argentina, who is also an environmentalist and protector of the seas. Together, we decided to invite the winners to an exclusive and private show on a cruise in the sea of Puerto Pirámides, while doing whale watching. This event raised the attention from different sponsors, who saw this not only as an opportunity to help the charitable cause we were helping, but also to use our viral content to promote their brands, generating awareness and encouraging sustainability causes.
That's why we like to say it's a ""Win-Win-Win"": where celebrities reach out to their followers in new, creative and emotional ways, fans have the possibility of living a once in a lifetime experience, while sponsors promote their products and, most importantly, everyone supports a charitable cause. 
We use these fans, celebrities, sponsors and NGO´s engagement to create bigger, worldwide and mind-blowing experiences. Following Calamaro's example, imagine we create an experience with Pitbull and Royal Caribbean as the main sponsor, helping a charitable cause they believe in, where the winner's prize is an all-included, 2-days cruise with an exclusive Pitbull's concert in the middle of the sea...The potential donations, reach, and marketing has no limit.
 
Why Blockchain?
We use blockchain not only to develop a fully transparent and traceable framework, with faster international transfers and lower fees. But, in addition to the traditional method that with your donation you participate in a sweepstake, we offer new ways of interacting. Such as:

Collectible PoDs to all those people who have made a donation through us.

Every celebrity and experience has their own limited collection of NFT's, introducing gamification to the model by giving a special prize to everyone who completes a collection. This motivates users to exchange the NFT's and complete the collections to win.
Additionally, inside every celebrity collection there will be sponsor's NFT's that will work as golden tickets to win sponsored prizes.
For example, we can make a campaign with Samsung and the winner of the ""golden ticket"" gets a complete update of his home office set up with Samsung's products.

The ""donate for free"" feature, where you can enter through a subscription model where everything donated through DEFI generates interest. At the end of the period you can donate the full amount or only the interest generated, recovering your initial donation. Here we target those people who usually subscribe to monthly or annual donation plans with nonprofit, but we can generate interests and add the opportunity to live a unique experience with their idol as an additional incentive.

 
MVP
We did an MVP in Argentina in partnership with the Red Cross. Where we worked with 8 important celebrities from Argentina,  David Nalbandian (professional tennis player), Maru Botana (chef), Alejandro Lerner (musician), Bruno Zuculini, Pico Monaco, Attaque 77, Lirman and Zabaleta.
Our business model generates viral content organically and that's how the MVP managed to raise more than 3 thousands of users in ~3 months without any marketing budget whatsoever. We also had great media coverage in important channels like newspapers and tv.
 
Cardano's ecosystem benefits:
We integrate different blockchain protocols and we truly serve as a bridge between fiat users and the blockchain ecosystem. We provide the ""baby steps"" most people need to start adopting and learning about crypto and blockchain through an easy and rewarding way.
We have different types of synergy in various levels with the Cardano Ecosystem:
- We provide a purposeful use of NFTs as Proof of Donations (PoD), taking the first step towards transparency when donating.
- We promote the use and trade of PoDs, boosting the use of Cardano's future NFT Marketplace.
- We work with different companies that act as sponsors for each experience and part of our proposal is to introduce them to the world of NFT's, giving companies the opportunity to take their first steps on blockchain and crypto. Being an excellent opportunity for partnerships with Cardano.
- We will work with different players from the Cardano Ecosystem such as, DEFI platforms, future payment processors, NFT marketplaces, etc.
- We will have a constant flow of experiences, giving the opportunity to work with many celebrities and attract the general public into joining the blockchain scene and more specifically to the Cardano Ecosystem.
- We have a unique equation where we connect celebrities, once in a lifetime experiences, sponsors and charitable causes. Cardano could benefit from the positive image that this equation creates, showing a purposeful use of blockchain and crypto.
- We can impact the use of the Cardano Chain. Additionally we incentivize fiat users to use ADA for their donations.
- We want to promote crypto literacy. Our platform promotes financial inclusion, where people learn to invest their money, debunking that the use of blockchain and crypto isn't for everyone, while helping a great cause.
- Finally our mission is to make an impact on the SDGs, so the Cardano Foundation can be an excellent partner and funds receiver. We share our vision on achieving global sustainable development by using technology and helping different charitable causes along the way.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Before going into our detailed proposal, we included a short summary on the (i) team, (ii) the cardano adoption in the next 3/6 months; (iii) a summary of our existing product in which we will insert the POC under this fund, (iv) a short explanation of this proposal, and (v) what 3-6-12 months success looks like.
Team – We have a versatile team with experience in blockchain projects that is able and committed to tackle this challenge within the budget proposed.

     Ipek Sahiner – senior engineer in tech industry https://www.linkedin.com/in/ipeksahinerschlecht/
     Shawn Jensen https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnj/
Cardano adoption and impact in the next 6 months – We already have a finished mobile application (2 years in development) to integrate this Fund 6 NFT in and are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected by Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6).
Short summary of the Profila app (as testing ground for the NFT POC) – Profila is a platform (mobile IOS/Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call ""Brands"") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance.
People can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) their personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see ""Illustration 1).
NFT use case summary – Our proposed NFT business model relates to constructive customer feedback and creative customer content, shared by people with brands.
Each time you use the Profila app to share with a specific brand of your choose your feedback or self-created content about their products or services (by sending in a picture, video or text via our existing ""consumer moments"" functionality), you can do so (1) privately for only the brand to see and respond to (option 1), or (2) you can choose to ""create an NFT"" representing your content, making it ""tradeable"" (option 2).
If you choose to create an NFT, it will be available to Brands for more elaborate use. By offering your content as an NFT, you invite a brand to use your consumer-created content in their commercial business (e.g. to publish on their website as example to other customer, or to integrate it into their marketing content). If the brand values your customer feedback (either for internal use or for public commercial use), they can compensate you for it by acquiring the NFT.
Option 1 is already possible today (=private). We want to develop the NFT functionality under this challenge.
Success after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be the end of the NFT development. Success after 6 months would be the integration of this NFT functionality POC into our existing app and first test with our existing customer. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of the NFT POC, used for each data subscription between a person and a brand on Profila. 
*********************************************************************************
Now let's move on to (detailed) proposal (!):
1.       The market explained – disconnect between brands and people (see illustration)
""80% of companies think they deliver great customer experience, but only 8% of customers agree""
According to a report by Bain & Company in 2019, 80% of companies think they deliver a great customer experience, but only 8% of customers agree. This shows a large disconnect between brands and consumers, even though companies have never had as much data about us as today. You would think that with all the data a brand collects about you, they know what you like and how you like to be approached. This is clearly incorrect.
The reason for this disconnect is partially due to the fact that the brand-to-consumer relationship goes in one direction. Brands decide (i) when to contact you (+frequency), (ii) via which channel, and (iii) the content you receive. You do not have an easy way to influence this process, nor to feedback to a brand what you like.
We can illustrate this by an example, most of you must have already experienced: you made an online Wholefoods-account to order some groceries but you now get 15 newsletters/week, and your social media feed is full of adds from Wholefoods of products that you either already bought, or that don't relate to you. You buy a pair of Nike sneakers on Amazon, and Nike will start sending you emails for other running shoes in the weeks thereafter, even though you have clearly no more need for running shoes.
Each day, you interact with digital services and purchase products from Brands globally. With each interaction you freely share your personal data with companies which then get used by these brands as they please. But what can you do if brands use your data against your expectations, and how do you keep track of how a brand uses your personal data? How do you tell them what you think/want, and make them listen to you + take action?
Today, there is no effective and easy feedback loop. The only consumer feedback that a brand listens to is often the negative kind, where you threaten them on a public forum and shame them into listening to you if they crossed the line, or if their product/service is underperforming.
We believe there is room for a 2-way street, where consumers get an easy channel to communicate their (positive and negative) sentiment to brands, privately, 1-1, and where brands can view consumer content and timely respond.
The advantages for brands are clear. Customer feedback helps brands create a better customer experience, improve their products and services, improve their customer retention, helps brands make better business decisions, etc.
2.      Profila today - the existing consumer App – our ""consumer moments"" and ""brand moments"" functionality
Via our Profila platform, we are redefining the brand-to-consumer relationship by making it a 2-way street, where both parties can (for now) privately share feedback and content.
Profila is a platform (mobile IOS/Android application for individuals and a web-based dashboard for companies, organizations, governments and other legal entities, we call ""Brands"") that enables individuals to communicate with various organizations in their lives, privately, one-to-one, and without supervision or surveillance.
People can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) their personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see ""Illustration 1).
A very important feature of Profila – which is crucial for our NFT business case (see point 3 ""Profila tomorrow – consumer feedback via NFTs""), is called the ""consumer moment"". Consumer Moments are a great way to capture your sentiments anytime, on any topic, and share content or feedback with a specific brand. A Consumer Moment is a photo or video that you can create and share in Profila, to which you can attach a comment and/or an emoji to express your thoughts and sentiment. Consumer Moments are one of the best ways that you can share your opinions directly with a Brand, in a private 1-1 manner.
Let's clarify this by an example of a GOOD EXPERIENCE You are and have always been a Nike fan. You have had your favorite pair of Nike running shoes for many years and are now looking to replace them. This is a perfect moment to share this with Nike and you take one last picture of your (now very worn out) Nike shoes, asking Nike for suggestions on a new pair (see the first app image on the picture we attached ""Consumer Moments – including NFT button"").
Once you capture the Consumer Moments, you can take the following actions to add relevance to the picture or video:
- tag it to an industry ""category"" (e.g. you can tag the category ""Adventure"" or ""sports"" or ""fashion"" because it relates to shoes);
- tag a relevant Brand (e.g. tag ""Nike"" if you want Profila to send the content to Nike);
- add sentiment to it (e.g. a smiley face emoticon or thumbs up).
Once you are ready, you can send it directly to the Brand, who will be able to respond directly to your shared Consumer Moment, so you know that your feedback – good or bad – is being heard. Nike seems to appreciate your picture and responds with a new pair of Nike running shoes that they have available in your size (see the last app image on the picture we attached ""Consumer Moments – including NFT button"").
This scenario also works for a BAD EXPERIENCE. If you bought your expensive Nike running shoes and they break on day 1; you can also take a picture or make a video, add a negative/unhappy emoticon, clarify you just bought them, and send it off to Nike for urgent feedback and restitution.
**important practical remark: if Nike is already a Profila customer and uses the Profila web portal, these customer moments can be viewed in the brand dashboard and Nike can respond to them in Profila by sending its own Brand moments. If however Nike is not (yet) a customer of Profila, we will send positive Consumer Moments to their customer feedback channel, and negative Consumer Moments to their claims/complaints channel.
3.      Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - implementing an NFT option into the consumer feedback moments, making them ""tradeable""
Our proposed NFT business model relates to constructive customer feedback and creative customer content, shared by people with brands, via our Consumer Moments functionality.
Under the Catalyst project fund 6, we want to transform our existing Customer Moments functionality to include a ""create an NFT"" button – called ""tradeable"" (see the second app image on the picture we attached ""Consumer Moments – including NFT button""), so that you can choose to have your customer feedback and content displayed into an NFT platform. Brands can access this platform (in the Profila web portal) to get valuable feedback from their customer, and even use some creative content in their business activities. By acquiring the NFTs, a brand would compensate you as an individual for sharing valuable data which they in turn can use to optimize their products and overall business (or even include it in their marketing).
Each time you use the Profila app to share with a specific brand of your choose your feedback or self-created content about their products or services (by sending in a picture, video or text), you can do so (1) privately for only the brand to see and respond to (option 1), or (2) you can choose to ""create an NFT"" representing your content (option 2). If you choose to create an NFT, it will be available to Brands for more elaborate use. By offering your content as an NFT, you invite a brand to use your consumer-created content in their commercial business (e.g. to publish on their website as example to other customer, or to integrate it into their marketing content). If the brand values your customer feedback (either for internal use or for public commercial use), they can compensate you for it by acquiring the NFT.
We see 3 options to use the Consumer Moments tab, of which 2 include the creation of an NFT (see our illustrations ""Consumer Moments - including NFT button"", and ""Tradeable - consumer moments NFTS""):
(1) Send to brand – ""private"" mode
If you want to share your experience about a product/service with a brand private, just share a consumer moment and click ""send to brand"". The company will be able to privately respond to your concern, or to your happy feedback.
(2) Send to brand – ""NFT"" mode
Under the NFT POC, we want to add a button ""NFT"", so that you can share your picture or video with a brand for commercial purposes. If you are ok that a brand uses your content for its marketing purposes, they can buy your consumer moment as an NFT.
(3) Send to industry category – ""NFT"" mode
Under the NFT POC, you could also choose NOT to tag a specific brand, BUT instead one of our industry categories (e.g. travel & adventure; food; clothing etc). This way, your NFT (representing your video or picture) would be made available in the NFT platform not only to one brand, but to all brands who are active in this industry that you chose. You can make a creative video about how you like to drink Gin-Tonics at the beach, and send it to all the companies in the ""Food and Drinks"" category who can choose to use your creative video.
What other challenges are ahead in our ""Zero-knowledge advertising & insights"" development roadmap?
This NFT project is only one step into our broader Cardano technology adoption, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. We have already WON one project (under FUND 5), and submitted other projects under FUND 6 (see below) for important features we want to develop as part of this effort:
- step 1 - personal data license smart contracts - under this step, individuals can select to share certain information to with a brand of their choosing and get compensated for it. (see our proposal in fund 6 – ""dapp to control/monetize your data"" - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/366908-48088))
- step 2 - privacy ledger – This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform, showing which data subject rights you exercised towards brands (e.g. the right to be forgotten, the right to rectify incorrect data etc). UPDATE - We have submitted this proposal under the ""metadata challenge"" of FUND 5 and received the first place! #thankyouADAcommunity. See here for our proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088. We will keep you posted on our progress.
- Step 3 - digital ID (for FUND 6) - Atala implementation – If you want to control your data online and receive (financial) compensation for your data, it is important you can provide proof of your identity. Atala Prism is the perfect solution. By integrating Atala, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments. We have included this functionality under Fund 6 – Mass adoption of ATALA PRISM DID, named ""control your data (vault) via PRISM; https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-vault-via-PRISM/367840-48088?submitted=1
4.    Practical aspects – ""show us the money"" – costs
Via this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our NFT proof of concept (POC). Creating a first POC of a NFT platform on the Cardano blockchain, will require at least a budget of 49.250 USD for a 4-month development project, to be allocated as follows:
- 35 days of senior blockchain developer @ 900 USD per day – totaling 31.500 USD
- 20 days of web/backend developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.000 USD
- 10 days of app developer @ 300 USD per hour – totaling +/- 4.500 USD
- 7 days of legal & operational work (draft license terms from NFT + verify privacy concerns with data in NFT) @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.650 USD
Blockchain / Crypto aspect (60%) would be the biggest part of the development, creating the NFT token platform and integrating it with ADA wallets;
Web/backend development (25%) to insert the NFT platform into the existing brand dashboard, so the B2B Profila users can purchase NFTs and utilize the consumer feedback/content.
App development is more limited (15%) and would mainly relate to UX/UI, adding a new button the Consumer Moments functionality so users can select ""create an NFT"" when they make a video or picture.
5.     Practical aspects – ""getting on the road"" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer
At the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 6, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.
(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila.
We have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021 (Q1 2022). According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 by the end of 2022 (by adding more brands).
(2) Geographical focus market? We are launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q3 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).
(3) Ideal consumer segment? – Millennials (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old) and brand-loyalists (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).
(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.
(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end of 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).
6.      Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)
As an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:
First, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.
Second, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.
In addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.
Finally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess (and take feedback) on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.
7.      Defining success
The NFT POC we would develop under this Catalyst fund 6 submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to improve the consumer-to-brand relationship by giving people control over their data and compensation for their attention.
Success of the POC development would be (i) creation of the NFT button into our existing App; (ii) working NFT platform into the Brand dashboard. Overview of the work-packages which technical requirements and sprints to be included shortly.
Success of the POC testing in the Profila Platform would be that we can (ii) validate that consumers choose to make NFTs for their content and feedback, and (ii) that brands utilize this content and pay consumers via an integrated or linked ADA wallet.

Develop a business ecosystem that businesses could use to capitalize on the rapid adoption of Cardano.  The goal would be to customer tailor a customer outreach and loyalty to the business, using a simple structured playbook.  The companies would also benefit by being listed within the platform, as Cardano enthusiasts are likely to prefer doing business with companies that also work with Cardano.  Some of the concepts are:
 
Early adopter NFT's that can provide lifetime discounts.
Creating redeemable tokens that can be used for services, or the purchasing or products with a likely discount for using this as a payment.
Milestone Badges.
 
The following requirements would be required to bring this platform to market:
 

Market research to create a typical playbook that can be tailored to each business.

 

Website development.

 

Marketplace integration for the acceptance of payments in both Ada and businesses custom redeemable NFT's.

 

Back end automation for minting and burning of assets, and completion of exchanges.

 
 
The following domains have been reserved for use of this platform:
 
cardanify.com
cardanify.io
cardanified.com
cardanified.io
 
These domain names create a distinct mental connection that a business has adopted Cardano as their preferred blockchain solution.
 
This proposal has been drafted by Digital Syndicate; a partnership between Huth S0lo and Eddie Diaz, also known as the Cardano Budz team.  Both team members have significant Information Technology backgrounds, working at the highest levels of network and systems design.  Both are active Cardano Community members, each running stakepools on mainnet and testnet.  Both have participated in plutus pioneers v2.
 
Funding will be used for web development, and back end automation development.
 
The planned timeline for developing this platform is as follows:
 
0-30 days Initial stand up of web page.
31-90 days Creation of playbook to be used for business cardano posture, development of back end automation.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


This proposal seeks seed funding for phase one development of an augmented reality (AR) mobile game App the core objective of which is the capture, breed and trade digital bison. Called BISONTOKEN, these NFT-empowered digital 3D animated bison shall, in time, demonstrate the ""life-like"" characteristics of real bison, generating adrenaline-pumping game play.
We define ""living"" smart contracts in the context of these NFTs as being able to respond to external economic and environmental conditions by being able to programmatically and periodically modify the terms written into the contract's metadata. In the context of our BISONTOKEN game pieces (virtual bison) this initially manifests in the programmable ""health"" of the animal as it ""matures,"" its reproductive capacity and its environmental responsiveness. The same programmable characteristics could subsequently be applied to other virtual ""living"" organisms or economic activities.
Playable on both iOS and Android platforms for smartphones and tablets, this demonstrator will utilize SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) technology initially to display life-sized, three-dimensional bison. The creation of these digital bison will enable the developers to both showcase future game play and, importantly, begin testing periodic metadata updates. The developers see this as the first in a series of progressive steps to bring ""artificial intelligence"" to these digital avatars via future interaction with SingularityNET nodes.
Because of its mobile (out-of-doors) game format, the developers also see the project as an important way to encourage players to be more active physically, in contrast to more sedentary desktop-oriented games. The goal is to introduce players and the general gaming audiences to the benefits of the Cardano blockchain and its ""living"" smart contract metadata capabilities.

Cardano IPR (Intellectual Property Registry) 
 
IPR is an important step in the adoption and propagation of NFT Business Model use-case per the Cardano Community Challenge.
 
The aim of Cardano IPR is to provide a fast, cheap, and effective way to register IP (patents, trademarks, copyright, licensing etc.) utilizing NFT tokenized smart contracts.  The registry applicant will be able to register their work with on-chain metrics to provide effective proof of ownership. 
IPR team proposes that NFT technology can be utilized to mint NFT Tokens with metadata in an on-chain registry that can clearly provide time and date stamped proof of ownership, to assist with legal settlement and dispute resolution, as well as providing innovators of decentralized Cardano projects with proof of ownership thru tokenized assets held in owners Cardano wallets.
We recognize that creators, inventors, and artists struggling with roadblocks, legal registry fees and the bureaucratic process of registering IP are in need of a fast, logical and inexpensive way to immutably register their works. 
 
Phase 1: Q1 & Q2 2022
Building a decentralized platform to allow users to register their works with ADA fees per registration, a Cardano IPR token with attached meta-data providing immutable, time-stamped proof of IP ownership thru the use of NFT tokens minted to Cardano wallets.  
Phase 2: Q3 & Q4 2022
Developing select features as needed to enable support of registration fee submission thru not only ADA but other native assets such as Djed.  Exploration of the potential of dispute settlement thru on chain governance.  Expanding on licensure, and the regulatory abilities of IP owners to license and sell the rights to their IP works as applicable.
Phase 3: 2023 & Beyond
Further Development and exploration of on-chain governance and community voting to give IP owners a voice concerning the registration of their works and other potential use cases.  Exploring the ability to use on-chain governance to issue grants to creators, artists, and innovators to assist in funding proposals in the Cardano ecosystem.
 
Success will be measured @ 3months as a functioning limited use prototype on Cardano testnet.
Success will be measured @ 6 months as a functioning alpha for public use.
Success will be measured @ 12 months as functioning product available for public use with limited use case features.
Success will be measured @ 24 months as a functioning product available for public use with expansions regarding licensure, on chain governance, grant proposal, community voting and funding.

Display the NFT collection for sale on flat-panel screens across the walls. Partner with a few notable artists in the Cardano NFT ecosystem, and feature them, taking a commission on sales, and profits on flipping collectible NFTs. The Ephemera Crypto NFT Gallery would be half fine-art gallery and half trading card shop for high net worth collectors.
Act as an educational initiative, providing exposure and education to people whom have no experience with cryptocurrency or NFTs. Get people set up with mobile wallets,
Initially plan to remain open for 6 months, or a year, to be extended if the gallery is a success. I imagine that if Ephemera Crypto were a success, scaling would be extremely easy.

Vast number of Chinese wallets cannot spend or move their crypto in time due to crackdown. It is dormant money. By creating a Chinese targeted Cardano NFT mobile game, it creates a way for them to spend it.
Background
Asia has more crypto ownership than all other continents combined.
The recent crackdown in cryptocurrencies in countries like China and Iran, has forced miners to look elsewhere. Although many institutional monies have moved out, there are still many individual holders who remain in China and cannot cash out their money.
The Gap
3 out of 5 top app spending countries are from Asia, with China leading with $30bn USD in 2017, double the figure of the 2nd place - the US. on $15bn. It is projected in 2022 that Chinese spending will reach $60bn, America $29bn and Japan $20bn.
The Chinese crackdown is aimed at official bodies and shops that are based or providing a service in China. Those establishments cannot conduct any business activities in relation to cryptocurrency. This does not limit any public member who already hold a virtual wallet that operates outside of Chinese soil functioning.
This means funds currently sitting in those oversea wallets held by Chinese public cannot be cashed out, but can still be used as it is not illegal to hold, and government cannot stop transactions happening outside of China.
A big part of the project's target audience is aimed at those public, offering a way to spend the stuck capital. As far as Chinese Government's concern, this project is just providing a gaming platform.
Adoption
Currently there are 8.9 million of mobile apps, and China constitutes 40% of app spending. By developing a play to earn, free to play NFT game that suits the Asian appetite, we can tap into the dormant funds and inspire the adoption of Cardano.
Vision
Initially, a website will be developed with the sale of limited founding NFTs for Ada. There will be no marketplace development for the project, but people who bought from us will be able to sell it on a marketplace - CNFT.
The money accumulated from the sale of founding NFTs will be used to develop the next stage of the project - the first phase of the game, which will be coded with Rust langauge. As development progresses, there will be more rounds of funding NFTs for sale. When the game is mature enough, it will be duplicated onto the mobile platform. This will open new revenue streams to fund the game development on a larger scale.
The game will be dubbed as a major Cardano NFT game, sparking the interest of people.

Stage 1: We have developed a tool that allows users to upload their asset on two blockchain systems:
 Firstly, customers can upload a certain file, we will store it on IPFS system. IPFS is a Blockchain network for file storage, each content of a file will produce a corresponding unique hash code.
 Then, customers can add metadata to their assets such as: Description; Copyright…
 Finally, customers can update to the Cardano blockchain, we will exploit assets into NFT with the amount desired by the customers, and then send the assets back to the customer's wallet.
Since we are not able to connect to plugin wallet on the browser at the moment, we will exploit NFT on our wallet and then send it back to the customers. In the future, when there is a smart contract on the Cardano Blockchain network, we will exploit directly on the browser's plugin wallet.
Stage 2: After many customers have turned their assets into NFTs on Cardano, we will continue to develop an exchange that allows these NFTs to be bought and sold. At that time, when you visit our website, we can connect to your wallet and see what assets in that wallet? And what assets are you going to sell? What is the selling price to put on the exchange and advertise to everyone. We will collect a amount of fees on each transaction
Stage 3: We will develop Functions that allow manufacturers to put their products on the Cardano system in the form of NFT to trace the origin. For examples: An enterprise can generate an NFT code for each pig to be sold; That enterprise sells the pig to another enterprise, that enterprise will divide the pig into pieces and we'll generate new NFT codes for each piece of meat that are linked to the initial pig's NFT code. From there, buyers at each supermarket will check the meat they intend to buy through which companies, how it is raised and where it is currently being sold.

Real estate is an asset class that continues to prove itself as one of the most consequential investments and therefore agreements an individual will ever enter into in their lifetime.
Lending protocols are reliant on centralized, faith-based systems of due diligence when qualifying a buyer for a transaction. This can lead to inefficient outcomes when a buyer pulls out of a transaction after they have been qualified for a purchase due to unforeseen financial circumstances. The Seller is reliant on these same faith-based systems to rest assured their property sale is moving forward, compounded with the outdated, centralized methods used to store and verify their property records and ownership rights.
Artifact is a solution that gives Sellers in a real estate transaction a method of easily verifying their records and rights to a potential Buyer via a ""bundle of rights"" NFT while giving lending protocols a way to verify in real time that the Buyer's meets the minimum risk profile to purchase seller's property via ""proof of funds"" NFT.
With the ultimate goal of providing decentralized methods and real-time solutions to buyers and sellers of a real estate transaction, Artifact aims to be 'square 1' in the NFT real estate revolution. With adoption and interest accelerating with every market cycle, NFTs promise to disrupt the real estate industry, but before peer to peer, transparent and law compliant real estate transactions can take place using blockchain technology, a solution like Artifact must be developed to represent the transaction data and real property records/rights as an NFT.
 
use cases include:

create efficiencies by verifying and updating buyer's qualifications to purchase property in real time.
increase consumer/marketplace competency by encrypting fundamental property rights (variations of the legal definitions of ""possession, control, exclusion, enjoyment, and disposition""
increase consumer/marketplace fidelity by encrypting the documents that connect the property owner to the property itself: deed, liens, chain of title, mortgage records, etc. 
  create transparency and increase identity by offering a decentralized method of publicly recording and verifying property owner's records/rights to reduce marketplace fraud
  create efficiency for the future purpose of offering decentralized marketplace functions powered by NFTs for buying/selling/exchanging real property using smart contracts offering consumers more control over their property

How Artifact NFTs operate:
Phase 1: Buyer Side) Aligns seamlessly with traditional lending as well as DeFi lending protocols to mint ""proof of funds"" Artifact NFTs for Buyers in a real estate transaction. This product will increase transaction efficiency and transparency by using blockchain technology to verify and update financial due diligence in real time all without breaching personal privacy of the buyer. The Token won't need to harbor personal data to update and verify that the buyer meets the lender's minimum risk profile in real time because the ""proof of funds"" NFT will only broadcast the signal of the state of the relationship between buyer and lender.
 
""proof of funds"" Artifact NFT process:

buyer identifies property to buy
buyer works with lender to submit documents defining lender's due diligence (i.e. proof of buyer's income, proof of buyer's assets, proof of buyer's credit history, proof of buyer's identity)
lender encrypts buyer data using Artifact and issues buyer ""proof of funds"" Artifact NFT that serves as a real time ""green light"" indicating a qualified state, helping qualified buyers compete in hyper competitive markets and helping sellers verify the most assured offers for their property.
buyer enters into contract with seller contingent on buyer's NFT remaining in qualification state
Transaction closes

 
Phase 1 (Buyer Side) Tech Development Goals:
milestone 1- Develop lender client facing application where ""proof of funds"" Artifact NFTs are minted
milestone 2- Develop smart contract capabilities that transparently verify status of buyer's financial ability to close deal
milestone 3- Develop public and private keys for updating lender due diligence records.
milestone 4- Audit security of smart contract and fluidity of data streams.
milestone 5- Commercially launch lender client facing application
 
Phase 1 (Buyer Side) Operational Goals:
milestone 1- Voters elect to successfully fund Artifact from catalyst fund 6
milestone 2- Sign deal with commercial and residential mortgage lenders
milestone 3- Verify funds for 10,000 transactions by end of Q1 after launch
milestone 4- Raise subsequent funds for further product development and marketing
milestone 5- Verify funds for 100,000 transactions by end of Q1 after launch
milestone 6- Sign deal with commercial and residential mortgage lenders in every state of U.S. 
 
++Phase 2: Seller Side)++Aligns seamlessly with real estate escrow companies on the acquisition/disposition, origination, refinancing and entitlement of real property to encourage adoption by allowing the buyers and sellers to elect to encrypt, and therefore, represent their property records and rights onto the Cardano blockchain with ""bundle of rights"" Artifact NFT. This NFT will map the ownership structure in the real world onto the blockchain that will not only securely prove the property owner's entitlements but also give them a financial instrument that can be securitized, traded, tokenized or simply held to enhance appreciation of their asset while increasing resale value. Property owners can elect to mint their property's NFT at acquisition of property through title company client portal, or elect to mint at any time during ownership via title company client portal.
 
How are ""bundle of rights"" Artifact NFTs represented in the county clerk or public records office?
It is increasingly well known how NFT's are technically represented on the blockchain, but it's very obscure how they might technically be represented in legacy governance/market systems.
We are designing the ""bridge"" between the world of smart contracts/ledgers and the world of papers/files using consensual liens.
Upon electing/consenting to mint an NFT for your real property, the NFT would be represented as a ""consensual lien."" 
On the blockchain, the ""bundle of rights"" Artifact NFT represents all legal abstractions of the unit of real property that connects the chain of title, financing records, ownership rights and current deed with the current ownership structure of that property.
In the local county clerk's office where property records are stored and verified, a consensual lien agreement will represent the NFT, meaning that the property cannot be sold or transferred to any other owner without the consensus of the lienholder(s) and/or the satisfaction of the terms of the lien (This right is fully realized when the property is unencumbered)
 
Phase 2 (Seller Side) Tech Development Goals:
milestone 1- Develop escrow client facing application where ""bundle of rights"" Artifact NFTs are minted
milestone 2- integrate ""bundle of rights"" Artifact NFTs into a consumer facing wallet solution where ""bundle of rights"" Artifact NFTs will be stored
milestone 3- Build out user interface and polish front end development
milestone 4- Test backend development and audit security of consumer facing NFT custody system
milestone 5- Commercially launch escrow client facing application and consumer facing wallet integration
 
Phase 2 (Seller Side) Operational Goals:
milestone 1- Voters elect to successfully fund Artifact from catalyst fund 6
milestone 2- Sign deal with our title company client that provides Artifact NFT minting to title offices in 21 states
milestone 3- Mint 3,000 Artifact NFTs by end of first quarter from launch
milestone 4- Raise subsequent funds for further product development and marketing
milestone 5- Mint 10,000+ Artifact NFTs by end of second quarter from launch
milestone 6- Sign deals with more title company clients that provide Artifact NFT minting to title offices in all 50 states
*Relationship is in place with large nationally certified title company who is ready to become our first client for phase 2.
 
Three Month Goalpost:
Complete research, publish White Paper with code used to define NFT minting process and smart contract utilities for Phase 1 (Buyer Side)
Six Month Goalpost:
Launch Phase 1 (Buyer Side)
One Year Goalpost:
Reach Milestone 6 of Phase 1 (Buyer Side) and launch Phase 2 (Seller Side)
 
Allocation of Funds:
Blockchain, Technical Development Advisor-$60/hr (5 hrs a week, one hour each weekday, $300/week, $3600 total) 
Plutus Pioneer, Workflow Consultant- $60/hr (5hrs a week, one hour each weekday, $300/week, $3600 total)
Blockchain Developer- $33.33/hr 25hrs a week, $3,333/month for 2 months
Fullstack Developer- $20.85/hr, 20hrs a week, $1,666/month for 2 months
Marketing/Float- $2,800 (advertising to meet with traditional lending as well as DeFi lending companies to gain business relationship)
 
Conclusion: When the methods of verifying Buyer qualifications and representing Lender due diligence are decentralized and rolled-up via NFT coupled with decentralized methods that verify Seller property records and rights are rolled up via NFT, a real estate marketplace powered by NFTs can function and be exposed to the innate creativity and value inherent in healthy market ecosystems like Cardano.

Blockchain Power, LLC is the Delaware (United States) limited liability company behind the NFT with the goal of offsetting 100% of the power used in blockchain creation and management. The two founders have developed several gigawatts of solar projects globally and have 12 years experience with solar development and funding.  Greg S.K. Ness created many of the contracts currently used by financial institutions, utilities and developers related to securing land rights, providing interconnection, purchasing and selling power and securing capital that are currently in the market.  Jon Downey currently serves as the CEO of one of the largest solar energy development companies in North America and has successfully led numerous capital raises in the renewable energy industry. 
Proposer LinkedIN Profile:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregness2021/
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jondowney1/
We are proposing a specific and recurring use case with NFTs to solve for the constraints to renewable energy development. The constraints are project realization uncertainty and pricing hurdles caused by the following: 1) the high costs to interconnect a renewable energy project to the utility grid; and 2) the lack of regulatory transparency.
Our non-art NFT based model will drive even greater demand for NFTs, increase adoption of Cardano, amplify use of the network, and show the public what's possible with NFTs.
Regarding Point 1 (the high costs to interconnect to the grid) - in many districts/states/territories, renewable energy project developers and owners must pay to build facilities and upgrade grid infrastructure in the areas they will be operating their renewable energy project. These costs are often the most significant expense outside of the construction of the power facility itself and cannot be controlled by the developer/operator. Pricing is typically set by grid operators or study boards with limited or opaque transparency in terms of their model and governance.
Additionally, and addressing Point 2, the regulatory authorities and government bodies in many states/countries/regions have been reluctant or have refused to provide transparency with respect to energy pricing models and interconnection procedures used by utility grid operators/owners. This has led to lower pricing for renewable power since it is hard to determine accurate market pricing for the power generated by the renewable energy facility.
Likewise, as government leaders are voted in and out of office, the shifting priorities within government administrations and between different levels of government create uncertainty during the years-long process of developing renewable energy facilities both in the United States and globally that increases both costs (due to capital risk premiums) and attrition rate. For example, Candidate A may have a strong interest in fossil fuels and create legislation that further allows the grid owners and operators to work in the shadows and set arbitrary pricing, while his/her predecessor may have done the opposite. In other words, two steps forward, one step back.
Further, in many regimes, any government support from a favorable regime only comes after the facility is operating which necessitates earlier rounds of expensive capital to bridge the time between development/construction start date and the commercial operation of the project.
The problem's financial cost is vast. 
The calculations below assume a total offset need of 170 terawatt hours tWh with all of the energy production coming through solar and solar+storage at an average efficiency rating of 22% and average cost of $1.00/kw.  For those outside of the energy space, a terawatt-hour (TWh) is one trillion Wh, or 1,000 GWh
Thus, according to these calculations, we would need 88GW of capacity at a cost of $88B to offset all energy usage. However, this analysis supposes that we are paying for 100% of the cost of the power facility. Instead, we will often only be granting/loaning the amount of capital necessary to make renewable energy facilities economic on an expedited schedule (by offsetting, for example, high Interconnection costs or equipment price spikes). Under this scenario, we anticipate funding only 10%-20% of the aggregate renewable energy facility development cost while relying on traditional funding mechanisms to provide the balance of the capital stack. With this strategy, we would need to deploy between $8.8B and $17.6B.
Going deeper regarding what's currently available in the market, there are generally two commonly used mechanisms to encourage renewable energy development globally – government tax credits/direct funding and Renewable Energy Credits (REC's/SREC's/carbon credits). While helpful, these tools are significantly constrained by their very structure as explored below.
Regarding Renewable energy and carbon credits (often referred to as ""RECs""), they are often purchased by power generators and large corporations to offset their carbon-based energy production/usage (not for a profit motive). However, RECs and carbon credits have two major problems. First, is the timing of cash receipts which occurs as the power is produced, which, similar to tax credits, necessitates expensive bridge capital. Second, there are the inefficiencies of the market itself given relatively illiquid markets in many places which leads to substantial pricing variances between similarly situated renewable energy projects. Additionally, these markets tend to be relatively inaccessible to small investors looking to offset their own carbon footprint (indeed, how many of you reading this would know where to go to buy a REC in Europe or the United States?).
We believe that proof-of-stake blockchain technology is the best tool to use to solve the energy issues created by increased blockchain deployment, regulatory hurdles and fossil fuel centric political agendas. The ecosystem created by a solar energy NFT will directly make more renewable energy projects viable by injecting capital at early stages of the renewable energy project development life cycle and by offsetting high interconnection and equipment costs.
In addition, the ecosystem:
a. Provides a means for blockchain technology to directly offset CO2 emissions through USD or stable-coin currency transfers to renewable energy projects; and
b. Provides a means (NFT Badge) for companies and sustainability funds to readily show evidence of their support for CO2 offsetting renewable energy projects to all stakeholders.
Process:
1. ADA owners purchase the NFT at the level of their support which can be displayed on all social media or traditional media platforms.
2. Blockchain Power provides grants and low interest loans with the capital generated through NFT sales to developers and potential owners of solar energy projects globally.
3. If loans are provided, repayment of the loans provides additional capital to be re-deployed to additional projects.
4. The Blockchain Power team, using its expertise in global renewable energy project development will work with regulated utilities regarding payment of the upgrades, and collaborate with stakeholders on making sure the utilities use the capital for the required infrastructure upgrades.
In the future, we also have a strong interest in creating a solar token based off the Cardano blockchain that we call the ""DEPWR"" Token, and in such event, we'd use the structure below:
If and when we create the DEPWR token, with assistance from the community and others, the process would be:
1. Blockchain Power sells DEPWR token;
2. DEPWR token owners purchase the DEPWR NFT at the level of their support which can be displayed on all media (we can use https://www.cnft.io/ or other platforms as necessary). 
3. Tokens used to purchase NFT's are resold to market or added to reserves for other solar projects
4. Blockchain Power provides grants and loans with the capital generated through token sales to developers and owners of renewable energy projects (similar to Phase I);
5. If loans are provided, repayment of the loans provides additional capital to be re-deployed to projects (similar to Phase I).
For many funds and investors in the blockchain space (as well as outside of it), an easy means to communicate their support for renewable energy to offset their carbon footprint is a critical and missing piece. The solar NFT also solves this problem. By using ADA to purchase the solar NFT, supporters will be able to display their support on websites and marketing materials globally. It is the badge that proves your commitment to carbon-free energy production. Further, it can be easily validated by auditors through the blockchain itself.
The initial goal of the Blockchain Power ecosystem is to provide a safe, transparent and convenient source of liquidity to bring renewable power projects to fruition and to provide supporters of such enhanced renewable energy asset deployment and carbon reduction with a means to quickly show stakeholders and the general public the scale of their support. We can drastically hasten the adoption of renewable energy through our investments – greening the entire global grid and more than offsetting any negative CO2 impacts from non-renewable crypto mining.
An interesting recent article on some of the problems related to the United States power grid can be read here:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/29/power-grid-problems/
One questions that might come up is how do you guys know where to target grid upgrades?
One quick way is as follows:
We can use a Power Flow software (PSSE, PowerWorld, etc.) to study the utility's grid and how the elements (substations, transmission lines, etc.) are impacted by the addition of the new solar energy generation. This approach can be used for a statewide or regional electricity ""injection"" analysis (higher level) or a specific point of interconnection Injection Analysis. Or we can receive proposals from communities and developers and help run the analysis as needed. 
Critics of the idea that renewable power can be used to ""mine"" crypto currencies because of time-of-use versus time-of-production inconsistencies (i.e., you can't produce solar power at night so any mining at night must be stopped to have a ""green"" coin), while technically correct, miss the larger picture – that renewable energy deployment within the current framework and its global adoption is still in the emerging stages. As such, the conversation around achieving a sustainable energy grid and matching a specific electron produced to its end use and calling it green or not makes no sense at this point. Our goal should be fully offsetting all energy used in blockchain production with renewable resources – regardless of when or where those electrons are produced.
Success is measured by the amount of NFT sales to users. As the community of users grows, greater awareness for Blockchain Power's mission and increase of capital for new development projects will result.
• During the development stage, Blockchain Power anticipates allotting six months for development of its entire ecosystem, including the NFT and possibly the DEPWR token.
• Once the ecosystem is operational, Blockchain aims to acquire at least ten corporate NFT purchasers and 100 individual purchasers.
• After a year of being operational, Blockchain aims to acquire a minimum of twenty corporate NFT purchasers and 500 individual purchasers.
-Depending on the success, we would deploy the proceeds directly to at least two high impact utility upgrades in communities that would otherwise have more solar energy (or sometimes any) solar energy providing power to the utility, individuals and businesses. 
We've already consulted with attorneys on any needed legal structuring, and have approached approached several energy developers and asset owners about this idea and have received substantial amounts of excitement.  As such, we would have a public launch date of 12-15-21.
The requested budget is as follows:
5,000 ADA equivalent for initial marketing of the platform, this will involve further outreach to asset owners, corporate sustainability directors and the wider blockchain community.
5,000 ADA equivalent for legal expenses incurred for corporate and tax structuring.
*10,000 ADA equivalent for consulting services related to minting the NFTs and making full use of the Smart Contracts deployment.  This is an area where I can use some additional technical assistance from the Cardano community. 
It is important to note that we've already spent approximately 20,000 ADA of our own to initiate this project.  Additionally, we have familiarized ourselves with the transmission issues that are problematic (but obviously a great deal more study is needed).  For instance, A solar congestion analysis is currently underway to identify transmission congestion patterns in the SPP and MISO energy market for the 2026 study year in the United States. The utilizes models developed using PROMOD TAM™ which is licensed from Ventyx (ABB)™.  Using an hourly commitment and dispatch algorithm, various scenarios and study years are analyzed to provide forward looking LMPs, basis differentials to relevant trading hubs, generation dispatch, transmission flow and congestion. Hourly solutions are evaluated to determine the most economic system solution given generation, transmission and operational limitations. For this analysis, the SCED analysis includes an 8,760- hour evaluation of the 2026 study year.  2026 was chosen because that's how ridiculously long it takes for the utilities to respond and process applications.

Another good part about this project is; its huge scalability as well as flexibility in terms of accommodating different customer segments that are related to each other in some way. We can scale it to other African countries like South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and others who would show interest. The project can also be elasticated to an extent to give options for architectural designers to put up their works for sale as NFT enabling them to earn royalties off of a resale of their work. This by itself solves the hassle of freelancing urban architects to find clients and get paid appropriately.
Moreover, there is a good potential in the platform to attach domestic water and electricity supply services to main NFTs(Real estate and land ownership), keeping in mind that people are most likely to use these.
The house tokens and land tokens will keep records of crucial data of the physical asset including those that are related to its value in the market, location, and links to token metadata will be stored in decentralized storage. The tokes will be created and will be available to the public in the digital marketplace. The marketplace will enable the trading of tokens as well as view details of the tokens. When a property is registered the corresponding legal documents are validated and their copies are attached to the token (Token metadata).
We would like to be on the right side in fighting corruption in the land and real estate market by providing traceability of economic activities in the sector, creating and using NFTs on the Cardano blockchain, the blockchain by far more secure for NFTs as the result of advanced design and technicalities.
The major features of this niche NFT-Marketplace include:

Generate Assets history and QR code for owners (printable).
Showcase the assets with the corresponding history.
Token details: like the location, infrastructure in the area and in the property, built date, construction contractor(if any), owner information, the real estate company information (when applicable), telephone, water, and electricity services(if available)
Tsoken sales (payment is the ADA equivalent of the value in fiat currency, while taxes are calculated in fiat)
Search Token by QR code 
Amount of properties a Real estate business owns/sold/built
ADA will be the primary currency for payment on our platform
Process tax, and related payment in local currency 
Generate receipt in local currency
The seller shows the receipt to the National income tax office and pays the determined amount

 
Revenue model

Transaction fee from the purchases
Annual or monthly subscription fee
Registration fee
users would have to send the scanned file the legal documents of the property along with required information about the property and it gets validated by a professional. Once validated, the token will be created in the blockchain land listed in our marketplace.

Value Proposition:

To Cardano: ADA usage and the Cardano blockchain adoption
To Users: Avoids expensive middlemen, Avoids Price inflation caused by stacks of middlemen, Easy access legal documents, Untamparable Proof of Ownership, Legality proof both for owners and buyers, Land Administration Authority will take full monitoring access on the sale and gift, and part of the plan is to pursue the business model in the following repeatable and interoperable cycles.

 
1. Customer Development and Team dynamics ( Three months)
First thing first, we establish regular communication with private real estate owners and Addis Ababa city mayor office independently but parallelly, to understand the full dynamics of their constraints, the details in their problem set, cultivate their understanding about what a blockchain-powered application can do(more specifically non-fungible tokens), and understand how they want our solution to fill the gaps in their business by showing the most minified product of solution to give them enough hint about what to expect.
Alongside, building efficient team dynamics. We would hire experts needed to build the platform fully engineered as well as sustaining our project as a thriving business.
Having those two intact, once we get a yes node from one of the prospects(a real estate company and/or the land administration office), we will proceed to develop the solution considering their preferences and security of tokens; next step.
 
2. Product development (Six months)
Still keeping our communication with our direct customers, we will go on building the platform in their preferred way and ensuring end-user convenience without violating crucial values like security and visibility of the traceability of tokens.
As developing the product's features progresses through milestones, we keep the customer development process and taking feedbacks.
The product will be carefully built with capabilities of accomodating the fairly complex behavior of land administration.
 
3.  Adoption (Four months)
We make strategic partnerships with entities including prospective clients to adopt and promote our services along with their own services. We would also give an extended free trial period to use our platform and promote it appended to their own regular promotion.
Using the appropriate marketing channel, we spread the news about the value/service we provide to our customer segments.
 
4. Scaling (Four months)
At this stage, we would raise investment funds from promising local investment organizations/groups such as this to support expenses for scaling our service. Scaling up will require us more budget for expanding technical utilities like servers, human resources for the new scope of the project, marketing expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses.
 
5. Sustaining and continuous product improvement (Continous work)
Sustaining the project as a full profit organization thriving in the space providing values to the stakeholders in the sector and the general economic aspect of the East-African region.
We would mix up the 5 stages a little bit, as they go that way by their nature.
The Opportunities:

Perfect timing: It will give us the first comer advantage, Cardano's latest deal with the Ethiopian gov't paved the way to some extent, and the gov't is calling upon local innovative solutions for local issues
Immense demand: The sector is problematic and the gov't doesn't know what to do with the middlemen except appreciating platforms that would avoid them, investors commit corruption with local land administrative officers taking advantage of gaps in the non-blockchain digital solutions( mainly the mutable states), hence the government highly appreciates blockchain solution.
Accessibility of stakeholders: We can access the potential users through the land administration office's advertisement and if (or when ) the administrative office decides to use our platform as a storage of the assets in a tokenized manner
Supportive Environment: Tech solutions are highly appreciated in Ethiopia and everything is going digital.

Risks and Challenges:

One challenge is that there could be slower adoption to payment in ADA but the recent announcement that the Ethiopian government signed a contract with Cardano to build blockchain-based digital identification of 5 million students and teachers would pave the way for us to some extent.
Another challenge is finding a good Plutus smart contract developer and NFT marketplace developer on a budget. Although it's not as difficult if we get help from the Cardano community.
Risks in the space are quite a few and at the minimum level, and there is room to pivot if necessary.

Success Measurements:

Making key partnership
meeting project milestones
Meeting client expectation
Good user experience
Return on investment a year after Adoption stage
Self-sustaining
early-stage adoption from the land administration office of Addis Ababa, private real estate owners, and end-users.
Customers actually gaining the proposed value
The project becomes self-sufficient after securing two clients.
Enabling services for water and electricity based on clients openness
Start scaling up to the international market after 18 months of successful adoption of the local market

 
Budget plan:
Most of the budget will go to salaries of experts helping to realize the project, here is the plan:
Three months budget:

Quality Assurance officer: $1,500 for 3 months (par-timer)
Legal consultant: $1,500 for 3 months (it may not necessarily be sequential months).
Business consultant: $1,500 for 3 months (it may not necessarily be sequential months).

 
Six months budget:

Plutus Smart Contract Developer: $16,000 for 4 months.
DevOps Engineer: $4,000 for 4 months
Back-end Engineer: $4,000 for 4 months
Front-end Engineer: $4,000 for 4 months

12 months budget:

Customer service officers: $6,000 for 12 months
Project Manager: $24,000 for 12 months
Cloud services:  AWS Graviton2-based EC2 instances; p2.xlage($0.9/hr) = $7884  for 12 months
Internet connection: $2,000 for 12 months
Marketing: $3,000 for 12 months
Accountant: $6,000 for 12 months
Office rent: $2000 for 12 months (Temporary co-working space rent, until we start generating income)
Miscellaneous expenses for some minor affairs in relation to this project: $2,126 for 12 months.

The total budget to fully the project is 79,510 USD.
We ask for a 45,410 USD funds from Cardano to be able to develop the product and the customers, get licensed in local authority, and secure one or two clients.
We have plans to acquire the remaining 34,400 USD later on, at the adoption and scaling stages from other options like Venture Capitals, and different investment groups.

This proposal is derived from my daily observation of my friends in the construction/real estate sector, my community issues with buying/selling assets like houses and lands, victim complaint programs on news channels, and my own experience. There will be great value in solving this critical problem.
 
P.S. While writing my proposal, I kept in mind that fashioning this project to become a win-win for our clients and the end-users (clients of our clients), and for Cardano simultaneously, the key things that would define the project's success in short and long terms, milestones, estimating a budget for each milestone, which experts to hire and where to find them, how to find and approach prospective clients and understanding their point of view, and way to run the project as a self-sustaining business.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Cardano has branded itself to be a sustainable, scalable and interoperable blockchain. To continue down this path of being the ""most environmentally sustainable"" cryptocurrency, Cardano should further align its values and goals to the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). UN has 169 associated targets and over 5000 active actions with various sectors to build a sustainable future. UN has set a 2030 Agenda, called Catalyst 2030, that has over 39,000 full-time employees in 71 countries serving over 180 countries and has reached over 4 billion people worldwide. By aligning Cardano's values with the SDGs, Cardano will be able to connect with a vast number of corporations that are actively supporting SDGs which can in turn increase mass adoption rate towards Cardano. To bring Cardano's vision of success a reality, WottleNFT aims to do just that.
WottleNFT strives to be the first Sustainable NFT Auction Site that aims to build an interconnected ecosystem between Cardano NFTs and Social Enterprises. The reason why Cardano should work with Social Enterprises is because they are the driving forces behind SDGs. In 2020, there are more than 600 member institutions and 900 individuals working in more than 190 countries that are covering all 17 UN SDGs. The impact of collaborations with social enterprises is also shifting philanthropies by breaking down traditional silos that are interconnected, such as education, health or nutrition. If Cardano were to assist Social Enterprises worldwide, it can not only accelerate UN's progress towards achieving the 2030 SDGs goals, but will also be able to change the hearts and minds of funders to a more holistic and systemic approach towards fundings.
Tim Hanstad, a former social entrepreneur and current CEO of the philanthropic Chandler Foundation shares that ""You can't effectively educate a systemically malnourished child, and by tapping into networks such as Catalyst 2030, philanthropic organisations can more effectively evaluate need and apply their respective funding strategies to the problem as a whole. This way of working is not without its challenges, but we are seeing this is increasingly accepted as the way to go in the future.""
Social Entrepreneurs are fuelled by a sense of urgency and a passion to deliver an impact. There is only have nine years left to achieve the SDGs. Only by working together can we stand a chance of making a difference to the lives that matters most.
How does WottleNFT work?
The business model of WottleNFT works similar to that of a social enterprise, with a twist. On top of royalties, a portion of the auction fees that WottleNFT collects, are channeled towards social enterprises. After an NFT auction has ended, the highest bidder will get to choose one of the 17 SDG goal that he/she supports. Afterwhich, he/she will choose a social enterprise that supports that underlying SDG goal. Once chosen, the smart contract will automate the auction transaction and channels the fees towards the chosen social enterprise. Since these donations came from the highest bidder, his/her efforts will not go unnoticed. Each profile on WottleNFT will have a transparent track-record of his/her contributions to Social Enterprises worldwide. Doing so, WottleNFT is not an ordinary NFT Auction Site, but a gateway to connect Social Enterprises with the Cardano Community.

💸 Market perspectives
Globally, 500 million smallholders produce more than 80% of the food production and contribute directly to feed 2 billion consumers. Agriculture accounts for 30% of the global workforce and for 70% of water use [1]. The agricultural and food market is valued at more than 8 Trillion USD worldwide and 1 Trillion only in the US [2]. This sector is highly centralized, in the US 4 dominant trading firms control more than 89% of the grain sector [3] where in France, 4 central markets share 91% of food market turnover. 2019 data showed that the agro-food supply chain (ASCs) produce 75% of food systems GHG where 26% of waste is generated by food service and 13% from retails [4] . ASCs lead to intensive food production that have severe consequences on the food autonomy and resilience. Smallholders that directly contribute to food autonomy and resilience, essential to preserve ecosystems, are collapsing. France and Germany report a lack of 200 000 smallholders workers (Deloitte) where ⅓ disappeared from 2000 to 2016 and another ¼ will disappear in 2030 (CRATER) .
COVID-19 pandemic increase the need for local and transparent food, which can be empowered by blockchain [5]. Blockchain traceability solution will reach 886 million in 2025 with IBM Food Trust partner, and iTradeNetwork (Hyperledger), Agriledger and AgUnity that compete to link farmers and industrial. However all actual blockchain solution are permissioned and highly centralized thus tends to raise the technological barrier for farmers and increase inequality between large farmers and smallholders.Thus we need to develop a new solution that can decentralized agriculture and raise mass adoption of farmers for the blockchain.
🍅 Product
A public and decentralized Public blockchain technologies can offer transparent traceability , public data about freshness and quality labeling but can also protect and reward smallholders for their productions and contribution to a safer and secure food system.
Digital Twin (DT) is a representation of a physical product that mirrors its states, behavior, position across its lifecycle. DT for Farm products can store products' details ( shape, weight, taste, variety) current production state (seeding,growing,harvesting), freshness, and transaction (importer, stockage, reseller). [6] [7] DT can help provide best-before-date and guaranteed shelf life that can directly reduce food waste [8] and helps farmers to collect data and make better product management and sales decisions.
Our product is a free access platform with comprehensive tutorial to create a robust NFT for farmers that include the following features:
NFT simplified design


 We let farmers make and store NFT in their wallet and give instructions to do so


The platform offer easy and comprehensive step to build an NFT with product data (name, type, geography, living/mineral source, product part), pictures and description through a simplified form translated. To do so we can integrate with existing api


The platform offer management function for the farmer to manage is NFT portfolio.


Universal standards


Data input from the farmer are register in the Global Product Classification (GPC) standards. GPC partnered with UN/CEFQCT, ISO TC 154, OASIS and W3C, is translated in 16 languages and the actual adopted consensus. [9]


This standard will helps for consumer and Ago-food supply chain adoption


Data will be accessible and computer to perform analysis.


Technical Embeed


Product and digital transaction can be stored onchain on Cardano


Digital twin NFT metadata can interact with farmers UI, ERP and IOT to mirror the actual state of the product


Metadata also store product traceability and certification information.


Then NFT should show the actionable insight:


Prove provenance and product history


Capacity to easily interact with farmers, consumers, cooperatives, suppliers , contractors, certification and inspection in a network dynamic.


Update status (status, content, owner) respect with oracle


🎯 Acquisition
We need to prove to the farmer that this solution is an easy and costless process that can have multiple advantages compared to other Blockachain traceability solution:


NFT will help them streamline the supply chain and audit trail. It will raises awareness for their consumersand helps the mproof the freshness and quality of the products.


NFT removes the needs for third parties, then rapidly farmers will be able to sell their products directly to the consumer, commercant and industrial using ADA or any currencies.


By register their product on the blockchain, proving their farmers status they can attract banks and investors more easily. Government, NGO and research can also help to detect and rewards farmers and cooperative more easily and perform analysis on food resilience and soil regeneration.


By proving their daily production and traceability it will be easier for certification center to give their production fair or organic labels.


Others services can be build on top of this NFT products such auditing, insurance, marketing, NFT swapping and cooperative integration.


🧐 Monopoly
The platform is open source and made for farmer to increase Cardano NFT mass adoption. NFTs will be build on the Cardano blockchain, GPC standards and design to evolve with farmers and IOT inputs.
We will provide research effort to design the NFT and create a user-friendly platform that help farmers to build and store their NFT. Thus we will develop a bigger ecosystem to of application and services to support their work.
This platform will be a first step for consumers, farmers, cooperative, government and NGO to collaborate in an universal NFT framework for farm products and build a decentralized agriculture beneficial for the entire society.
💰 Show us the money
This project needs a Cardano associate developer and an agro-industrial researcher both granted $5k for the following deliverables:


An open source platform prototype to create DT-NFT farm products with Github, tutorial, comprehensive data structure, show case and applications.


An exploratory research paper on DT-NFT farm products with dedicated effort made to develop an open source platform that creates comprehensive NFT stored on the blockchain.


As a written agreement, the proposal fund receiver is engaged to deliver funds to the main contributors of projects deliverable. Community followers are warmly welcome to help for the project development.
🚗 Getting on the road
For the next 3 months create the first functionality of the NFT maker and work on the first part of the research paper.
For the next 6 months the research paper will be completed and submitted, we will improve the platform functionality to integrate iOT and farmers input and associatie with farmers for a beta testing. We will also attract funded to keep on progressing and offer more services.
For the next 9 months the platform will be fully operational and farmers will be able to generate and manage their own tokens and interact with several services of traceability and transaction.
Defining success
Our mission is to open NFT to farmers for them to become a maker with the same level of technical, legal and bargaining power as agro-food industrial and decentralized agriculture.
By creating an online platform for farmers to become NFT maker we hope it will protect their ownership, products and prices, improve the supply chain freshness and access credit from collateral. Production will become responsive to local needs and supply chains will be structured around value creation.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Obtaining and exchanging intellectual property (IP) in the form of patents is a complex process. In this proposal I intend to define a system by which NFTs are used to aid in the process of both the establishment and management of IP.
**As a note, I have reworked this proposal to match more closely in line with the discussions through the comments that follow in order to tie the information together.
I believe it is also important here to establish how NFTs are involved in the management of IP. First and foremost, the NFT is not going to be the IP itself, rather the NFTs are tools to be used in the process of creation and management of IP. In examples below I show the NFTs being used for Identity Verification, Access Permissions, and Proof of Purchase.
An NFT based system for IP requires several important considerations:
- Original works and patents that exist on current systems still need to be referenced against as part of the validation process for if an NFT should be created during a submission review process
- NFTs for newly awarded patents need to be obtainable alongside traditional processes to help onboard creators into a DeFi system
- Existing patent holders need an avenue to obtain NFTs for their existing IP
- Systems must be created to store, manage, and exchange IP in a DeFi space
Obtaining NFTs for New and Existing Patents in a DeFi space:
The review process for obtaining a patent is expensive and time consuming. In order to ease the process, NFTs can be used alongside a peer review system that exists in the DeFi space. Here I'll discuss how a peer review process might work using NFTs as a core element.
In order for any IP to be officially recognized it needs to pass through many hands that confirm its claim. This process can be simplified by having the review process spread amongst peers around the world. The process would be split into segments that can be worked on by anyone with proper credentials. Each section worked on would also need a separate reviewer to ensure accuracy of work performed.
People working on the project would receive commission for their contributions to make the time they spend doing so worthwhile. A fair fee structure would need to be created and maintained as part of this, likely leading to the creation of a side chain for purposes of governance.
For the review process to occur, a platform must be created where all those involved in the peer review process are properly identified and brought together. They will need the ability to interact with the group or individuals who are attempting to patent their IP and work with them on edits, revisions, and changes.
NFTs are used here as the credentials of those peers handling the IP process. One part would be an NFT acting as the identity of the university, law firm, patent company, or other qualifying entity that the individual is representing. The other would be the personal NFT of the reviewer signing off on the documentation. Using NFTs in this way ensures that those working on the process are from reputable sources and have the ability to do so.
Once the process concludes and a patent is to be awarded an IP NFT would be minted and given to the originator. The IP documentation involved would next be placed on a server space and encrypted in such a way that the NFT minted for the IP acts as access permissions for that file. Access to that server space would be given to the individual or company that filled for the IP, using their Identity NFT. This way, the person or company can access the server for future management and exchange of the IP and they have an IP NFT for use when they are on the server to access the contents of the IP file itself.
Management and Exchange of IP using NFTs:
Let's imagine a sort of scenario where two companies plan to work out a very secure and private deal. Both companies arrive at a bank, show their credentials to the front desk, and are let into a back security deposit box room. In the center of the room sits a locked box on a table. They both sit at the table start by talking about the terms of the deal and setting up the paperwork. After they both agree to the terms, the buyer is lent the key to the box to verify the contents are what was expected. The box is closed, the key returned, and payment happens. Once payment is complete, the buyer is left with the key, and the seller leaves to go about their day.
So in this scenario we need to break down where all of our DeFi components fit. First and foremost is access to the room in which the deal takes place. In order to be let into the room both companies had to prove they were who they said they were. This is the first job of a NFT on the network. Both companies need access to a shared space where they can make the deal and they need to be sure that who shows up to the deal is who is expected. Identity NFTs can be used to ensure both parties are who they claim to be.
Second is the room itself. The room is where the transaction will happen. It is important as this location is where both companies want to meet to work on their deal. Think of it as a specific place on a server that each has access to. By using their NFT to verify entry, the handshake happens and both are connected at the specified address.
Next is the paperwork. Both companies would exchange documents and information on the server space. These documents would only be editable by the parties that upload them to the server, meaning their permissions are tied to the NFT used to access the server space. This keeps both parties honest in their dealings and ensures that nothing gets changed before or after any agreement is struck.
When an agreement is reached, both parties set up their previously discussed amounts to be paid. In comes the smart contract which will be designed to only execute once both parties place all the previously agreed upon items up for exchange.
After that we have to discuss the locked box itself. Think of it in terms of an encrypted file sitting at that server address. In order to access the encrypted file, the IP NFT acting as its key must be present in the accessing party's wallet. This ensures that only the owner of the IP NFT has access to the original files.
Additionally with IP involved it would be good if prior to the final execution of the smart contract exchange the buyer had a chance to inspect the locked box to make sure they were indeed getting what they intended. For this purpose I would propose a set of lending smart contracts. The lending process would allow for the IP NFT to be traded via a timed smart contract. This would allow for the buyer to inspect the IP files before agreeing to finalize the deal. The timed smart contract ensures that the NFT is still in control of the seller even if the buyer decides to back out.
Finally, the NFT is returned to the seller if it was lent out via the timed smart contract, regardless of if the buyer is still buying. This ensures confidence on the seller's end. The smart contract for the IP exchange is then agreed upon by both parties and fully executed. The seller gets their funds, the buyer gets their IP NFT, and the exchange is a success.
The buyer with the IP NFT now has control of the IP access and the sale of the IP to future buyers. Either party can access the server space again, but only the IP NFT holder would have access to the IP files.
As the process completes there are several other things that would help traditional finance to feel more comfortable. The smart contract that completes the sale can also update a ledger held at the permanent server address. This ledger could have more information about the deal between companies because it would only record exchange transactions that occur at that server address. Meaning that only companies that owned the IP would have access to see it and it could be much more complex than typical block chain data. Think of it as a public receipt file that permanently sits in that server location and nowhere else.
Another thing that can be done is that upon the smart contract executing, two NFT receipt images bearing the addresses of transactions, as well as other basic company info or watermarks, can be minted. This provides records for both parties involved if they so desire.
Creating a Unified Searchable Patent System:
The process of having searchable patents on DeFi is quite another story and it requires the patent owner to have a public safe accessible version of the patent information, which would need to be a copy and not the original documents. The IP NFT in that case would provide the ability to edit/upload the documents at a separate server address, one that is meant to be picked up by a search index and used on a DeFi internet space for public purposes.
Closing Thoughts and Remarks:
I believe that by using NFTs to redesign the patenting process we will lower the barriers of entry for the many industrious and keen minded individuals from all walks of life around the world. The purpose of this proposal is to act as a stepping off point for the community to build from. The scale and complexity of this system requires a level of expertise far beyond my own, but as Cardano is building a true world community I wanted to share what I could to inspire those looking to innovate and build something great.
Budget and Timeline:
As seen above, the full design and scale of using NFTs in the patenting process requires a lot of components that will need to be broken off into separate projects in order to see success. Many of these components may arise from other projects currently in development, but it will take some time to build the groundwork. With this proposal as more of a call to action for the developers in the community than anything else, I have fairly requested only 1 USD (the smallest non zero amount). In my mind, funding should be requested by each team working on the separate elements as it is hard to quantify what would be necessary to fund this project as a whole.
The timeline for this project is likewise hard to pin down but there are goals for the short, mid, and long terms that would show things are moving in the right direction:
Short Term:
Idea is circulated in the Catalyst community, inspiring future projects
White Papers showing NFTs being used for Identity Verification Processes, File Access Permissions, and Proof of Purchase are created
Security risks and robustness of NFTs being tied to IP outlined and explored
Mid Term:
Platforms for peer review and NFT exchange proposed and tested
Technical demonstrations of NFTs being used in earlier defined three cases
Partners amongst patent companies, universities, law firms etc. brought in
White papers of NFT lending contracts
Long Term:
Platforms for peer review and NFT exchange fully operational
Storing and access of IP for low barrier public research
Advertisement of NFT patent systems to draw in traditional patent holders
Possible Risks:
The project hinges on many factors that may affect progress:
First, it requires development teams to work on and build aspects of the project either directly or indirectly. If there's no interest in further development of this proposal by the community it will not progress far.
Next, NFTs must be shown capable to perform adequately in each of the three proposed roles and function on peer review and exchange platforms. As the major driving force of the design, the NFTs have to work as intended or the project will stall.
Finally, it will require the partnerships amongst existing IP handling entities in order to see its full potential. Since a lot of IP currently exists in other forms it is very important to bring on existing IP entities. Proving something even qualifies as new IP requires access to and knowledge of current IP. Without partnerships in the space it will be very hard to make progress at scale.

******* THE PROBLEM AND OUR SOLUTION ********
Most African countries have a traditional commodity market, where stakeholders have to be present in-person to make exchanges. Farmers and producers get unfair prices for their products. Lack of transparency and interception of brokers makes the price of commodities expensive for the consumers. Blockchain-powered commodity Exchange can be a transparent solution for every stakeholder in the exchange market. Ennarea will serve as a marketplace for producers and consumers and eliminate third-party intervention in the market.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Build an NFT marketplace that will act as a real estate market for buying, selling and investing in real estate. Tokenized properties will be bought and sold via smart contracts drastically reducing transaction costs and timelines. 
The first version of the marketplace (what we are requesting funding for) will be geared toward real estate investments, our flip tokens. Through the network we will be able to crowdsource the funding needed to renovate the tokenized property via our partnership with a qualified contracting team. This first iteration of the network will be easiest to implement because there are far less bridges to cross. The property ownership never actually transfers to the investors, no lending is involved, and the typical ADA wallet will suffice - the features planned for our network user wallet in the long term are not required for this. This initial functionality will simplify real estate investing, open real estate investing to investors with minimal capital/experience & reduce fees/responsibilities. We will establish a solid base of users by providing a simplified way to invest in profitable real estate projects, while introducing the idea of buying real estate with ADA. While the network operates as an investing platform, our development team will be working on the integration and implementation of the functionalities required to actually buy and sell (transfer legitimate ownership) tokenized properties on the platform. 
As our number of partnerships increase, adoption and development will continue to grow. We will then deploy the later versions of the marketplace, wallet, and property token that will allow for smart contract home purchases and sales on The Network. At that point we will have 5-7 well trained real estate agents working within successful brokerages across at least 7 states, generating buyers, sellers, investors, and properties to continue populating the network.

Big picture summary: A marketplace where properties can be bought almost instantly and sold in a fraction of the time it currently takes. Opposed to the current MLS structure where only real estate agents have access, The Chosen Homes Network is open to everyone that creates an account and verifies their identity. Along with gaining access to the marketplace, creating an account also creates a digital wallet for that user. This wallet securely stores a user's funds, equity and properties all in one place. This wallet allows users to send funds to buy a property and invest in flips, as well as receive funds for selling or receive their profits from a flip they've invested in. This will drastically reduce real estate transaction fees, saving both the buyer and seller money on every transaction. Transitioning real estate transactions to the blockchain will not only increase speed and efficiency but every property added to the network has its transfer and lien history coded into it, which is then automatically updated upon every future transfer. This establishes a new standard for accuracy and transparency of property ownership documentation. The fuel to the engine that is The Chosen Homes Network is its ADA staking pool. The ADA staked in the pool provides a consistent flow of currency that will allow The Chosen Homes Network treasury to back the value of the tokenized properties allowing for the instantaneous transfers. The treasury is able to act as the required party in any transaction, being the immediate buyer of a property being sold and providing a marketplace of available properties for users to purchase. This treasury/pool also allows us to completely restructure the lending side of homeownership by selling tokenized properties via smart contracts coded with terms of monthly repayment to the pool, radically reducing the financial obligation of homeownership and interest paid to own a home. This lending restructure routes the money that would otherwise be bank and mortgage lender profit. Instead each monthly payment is disbursed to the homeowner themselves, as they hold their equity in their Network User wallet, and to the treasury/pool that also provides consistent long term rewards to its delegators and uses 100% of its margin for charity.

Purpose of Proposal/Addressing the Challenge Question

This is going to be a learning journey wherein we will challenge local developers to solve a problem of group intellectual identity and ownership with an end goal of providing a verifiable certification on the Cardano blockchain.

Main Deliverable:

Create an NFT platform where local communities are given visibility in the global market in a way that allows them to claim rights as a community to their intellectual property.
Specific example: We will work with local communities to document fabric weaving pattern and design specific practices on the Cardano blockchain in such a way that designers like Louis Vitton will have a specific way to legally and fairly lease the rights to that pattern and print the designs on their merchandise. This is the long term vision. First, we need to address the problem of identity and ownership, especially in this context where it is a cultural identity belonging to many people and also holding similarities amongst geographically similar areas.

 ----------IMPACT-----------
How does the proposal fit into this challenge?

 Solving this problem of arts, crafts IP ownership will give these groups a starting point to reclaim their rights to intellectual property in the form of creative arts where historically such things are often unfairly appropriated and drive business use case on Cardano.

How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?
This will be a win win in preserving culture, cement NFTs IP use case and  has the potential to create businesses with recurring NFT use requirements which increase utilization of the Cardano blockchain.
----------FEASIBILITY--------
Reference & Past Successes:

The Cardano protocol is becoming the go-to place for diverse NFT use case due to it's metadata capabilities and eUTxO model
This project will start in Ghana where WADA has a rapidly growing presence.
WADA continues to hold both virtual and in-person events  for mentoring and onboarding new developers and entrepreneurs from Africa and diaspora. https://twitter.com/jaycidiq/status/1432106218923888640

Budget 3 month $17K

Event Logistics (online platform, event registration, physical space rental) $4K
Events Publicity, Organization, Travel & Attendee incentives: $5K
Market Research $3K
Outreach Coordination & Team costs $5K

Roadmap
Launch Date: Q1 2022

Consultation & Documentation of Selected Indigenous Crafts in Ghana (focus of this proposal) -> Digitize with 3D artists and animators -> Certify with Cardano Native Token (Dev & legal team) -> Showcase on B2B/B2C web app (eg. sale of Kente fabric to Western buyer, Kente accredited as traditionally made and money goes back to the indigenous peoples via WADA community centers)

Risk Management

This will ultimately be a complex multi country endeavor and interactions with a wide range of cultures and communities within West and Central Africa with attendant complex logistics and implementation issues
To minimize risks, we will start in one country and one community and scale up based on our learnings.

What is PlayerMint?
A way to make gaming a more rewarding experience through the use of fungible and non-fungible tokens. On the fungible side PlayerMint creates prize pools of a token called PMX. These prize pools get distributed out to gamers based on their in-game performance on popular titles like Fortnite, CS:GO, and Splitgate every 5 days or epoch. PMX is strictly earned via gameplay performance and there is no requirement for the user to spend money in order to interact with the system. This means there is no potential for monetary loss regarding gameplay performance.
 
On the non-fungible side PlayerMint features its own NFT marketplace. This is the gamers spot to mint their own crypto-assets to be traded and transacted on the open marketplace all through the token they earn via gameplay performance. This creates a token system economy fueled by gameplay and creativity all on top of Cardano.
 
What are Community Access NFTs?
In short, a way to enable exclusive access within a community through digital scarcity that can be earned, given, bought, and traded. Imagine your favorite content creator minted their own set of NFTs that not only had strong visual appeal but also offered unique benefits. For example you got to be a part of their next video, earned a role in their Discord with special permissions, and got a VIP badge on their Twitch. Community Access NFTs provide deeper engagement in a way that creates a positive relationship between creator and fan. The creator of course makes money through enabling this engagement and the fan can sell the NFT if they no longer want the access it provides them.
 
A prominent example of Community Access NFTs is what Gary Vaynerchuck is doing with VeeFriends. VeeFriends is an NFT project that grants its holder benefits in the form of access to Gary and what he's up to. Every single VeeFriend acts as a ticket to VeeCon, a business based conference, for 3 years. Specific VeeFriends offer additional benefits like the ""Video Game Vulture"" that enable its holders to play video games with Gary in person.
 
In the past week 162 VeeFriends have been sold at an average price of $64.9k leading to a sales volume of $10.52m (at time of writing). All these sales benefit Gary, but they mostly benefit the token holders.
 
Bringing Gamers to Cardano
Many creators and gamers are very crypto curious or have already joined the movement. One of the largest esports org founders, Banks of FaZe Clan, is already sporting a CryptoPunk as his Twitter profile picture. This isn't surprising as gamers are digital natives. They understand the value of digital items and are already buying cosmetics for their in-game characters and subscriptions for emotes on their favorite creators' Twitch channels. The jump to a token earned from gameplay performance and NFTs that provide further community access is an easy one for gamers and creators alike.
 
Launch Status
The PlayerMint project is currently being developed with lots of progress being made on its design. Because PlayerMint has not launched yet this proposal describes the team's objectives, key metrics, roadmap, and budget for before and after the launch of the product. A full product launch is expected around December of 2021.
 
Pre-Launch
Objectives

Education for creators and gamers on the basics of blockchain and quality NFT projects. This education will focus on using games as an analogy for how the technology works. For example explaining Bitcoin mining through Minecraft.
Once creators are educated the PlayerMint team will offer free consultation on constructing a quality community access NFT strategy. This will involve tokenomics, utility, and marketing so that the creator is ready to mint on PlayerMint once the product is live. 
The PlayerMint team will maintain a list of all creators ready to launch their community access NFT strategies as well as keep in close contact with them.

 
Key Metrics

The number of creators and gamers educated about blockchain/NFTs.
Total onboarded creators audience size.
The number of community access NFT strategies created.

 
Roadmap and Budget
$13k of the total requested funds will go towards the development of the NFT mint and marketplace on PlayerMint. This development is currently taking place and the requested funds would go towards its completion.
Roadmap - Effective Immediately: 
1. Creation of educational materials for creators and gamers
2. Distribution of educational materials
3. Strategize with creators for post-launch
4. Maintain contact with creators
 
Post-Launch
Objectives

Execute all community access NFT strategies made by creators under the consultation of PlayerMint. Ensure the creators are able to do an equitable NFT launch that creates excitement in their community that can be maintained for the long term.
Market and maintain the community access NFT strategies by focusing on helping the creator interact with their community, sell their NFTs, and increase overall engagement. 

 
Key Metrics (3 / 6 / 12 Months)


The revenue generated by creators: $40k / $100k / $1m


The number of creators and gamers onboarded to Cardano: 10k / 50k / 125k


The number of NFTs minted by creators: 5k / 12k / 50k


The volume of secondary market sales: $10k / $65k / $2m


 
Roadmap and Budget
$2k of the total requested funds will go towards enabling the PlayerMint team to help market community access NFT strategies. This marketing will be done in full collaboration with the creators in order to create mutual benefit between all parties involved. Any and all marketing materials associated with a community access NFT strategy will be approved by the strategies creator.
Roadmap - Effective at Product Launch: 
1. Begin execution of community access NFT strategies
2. Market community access NFT strategies with creators
3. Maintain contact and support for creators
4. Attract more creators
5. Repeat

Revenue Model
The PlayerMint revenue model has been constructed with the sustainability and longevity of the project in mind. PlayerMint mints PMX every 5 days. This means the years supply of tokens are minted in 73 separate epochs. Each epoch 80% of the minted tokens will fund the prize pool for gamers to get paid to play. The other 20% of the minted tokens will be distributed to the PlayerMint Team. For the NFT side of things the creator will obtain 98% of all initial market sales along with any royalties they set for secondary market sales. PlayerMint will take 2% of all NFT sales, both initial and secondary. Once the supply cap of PMX is hit this 2% of NFT sales will go towards funding prize pools for gamers to get paid to play. This revenue model aligns incentives between the PlayerMint Team and community. In order for the Team to have sustainable revenue the community must be receiving meaningful payouts of PMX and see reason to mint and trade NFTs.
 
Mint Condition Example
Thanks for reading the PlayerMint team's proposal! To finish things off here is a fictional example of what community access NFTs could accomplish for a gaming content creator:
 
Lovelace is a Youtube streamer with a total community size of 25k. She averages about 1k concurrent viewers per stream and gets quality engagement from her chat. Lovelace decides that it is time to quit her 9 to 5 and go full time on her passions in gaming and content creation. She needs to be making more money to do this but wants to avoid an increase in ads. Instead she turns to PlayerMint. Lovelace starts getting paid to play and encourages her community to do the same. After a month of this Lovelace starts minting her own community access NFTs that offer benefits like playing with her on stream and getting 1 free piece of merch every month. Lovelace is now financially stable from PMX payouts from gameplay performance and royalties from secondary market NFT sales that scale with her community size.

PLATFORM PROPOSAL:
Imagine a platform that connects these people to supporters who come together to create a microcommunity where economics are shared amongst all community members. For example, an individual in Africa wants to purchase a weapon for a game which can be used to earn money in that game. Or a person in Thailand wants to purchase land in a metalworld to develop a resort. They can post their projects on the platform. Other community members can provide tokens to support the projects via smart contracts. The individuals and supporters then form their own DAO which will own the NFT asset in the metaverse. They choose what to do and how to monetize the asset.
This platform gives people a way to earn a living in the metaverse and their work can be done any time of the day, anywhere in the world.  No real world physical limitations.  It also allows supporters to fund interesting and promising projects. 
These microDAOs are then part of the larger platform DAO with voting rights.
The key is that each microDAO must own the NFT asset and all assets derived from the microDAO (for example, if a weapon is earned or a building is built, then the microDAO will own it). Members have voting rights and decide how to monetize the asset. They can also transfer their interest in the microDAO. These tokens are asset backed by the NFT asset of the microDAO.
An example of the economics for each microDAO would be:
1. Step 1: Supporters receive 52.5% of the revenue from the NFT until they receive their initial funding. 40% goes to the individual/team. 5% goes to the microDAO to be spent on various microDAO initiatives. 2.5% to the platform. Members of the microDAO would vote based on splits except the platform has not vote. 
2. Step 2: after Step 1 is achieved (supporters receive their initial funding), supporters receive 20% of income, individual/team receive 70% of income, 5% to the microDAO and 5% to the platform.
All members get to vote in the greater platform DAO.
Other revenue opportunities can be staking and yield farming. For example, the microDAO to use their excess reserves to stake or farm.
Badges will be used for each microDAO based on revenue metrics. Each member will have badges that reflect the productivity of their projects in a particular microDAO and the number of prjects they are a part of. Badges can be used for various other purposes as well. To be fully developed.
 The economics may need to be worked out more and more fully developed. We may want to allow each microDAO to eventually vote on their own economics after a while so long as the platform DAO keeps its share.
This platform opens up metaverse capitalization and monetization opportunities for people all over the world.
TIMELINE (in sequential order):
2 months to find cofounders
3 months to refine economics and determine technical feasibility, especially for metaverses on other blockchains.  Also to further develop the idea. 
3 to 6 months to develop and test the platform and market and establish partnerships. 
12 months to launch
BUDGET (rough estimate):
Founders - sweat equity
Developers - USD$100,000
Marketing and Partnerships- $75,000

Summary
NFTs give physical properties (scarcity, verifiable property rights) to digital goods
Digital art has seen a large increase in value by leveraging NFTs
We speculate that other forms of digital assets may benefit by leveraging NFTs
Conceptually, 3D printers are a bridge between the digital and physical word
3D print assets that cross this bridge still maintain a portion of their digital properties (one digital file can create unlimited physical models, it is not easy to verify who owns the rights to these assets)
Using Cardano minted NFTs to create scarcity and verifiable property rights for 3D print assets will generate a massive amount of value for the 3D printing community and Cardano community.
Specifically, 3 areas of value include: Pay-Per-Print monetization for functional models, physical scarcity control for art related models, and digital scarcity control for collectable models
To achieve these value proposals we propose an application suite consisting of 3 different utilities.
The first utility is a slicing software that can communicate and verify NFT mesh files against the Cardano blockchain
The second utility is a web based solution for turning 3D mesh files into Cardano minted NFTs
The third utility is a web based solution for trading Cardano minted NFT mesh files
To drive adoption we propose a Youtube video campaign aimed at releasing entertaining and clickable videos that demonstrate how to utilize the application through example.
 
In Depth
The fundamental function of an NFT is to create verifiable property rights of digital assets, while also making it possible to control the digital supply of said assets. Currently NFT technology is mainly being used to create digital art marketplaces. NFTs allow artists to leverage the physical properties of art (scarcity, verifiable property rights) while simultaneously leveraging properties of digital art (network effect, distribution, ease of use).
Using digital art as a model for success, we speculate that other forms of digital assets may see a large increase in value by utilizing NFTs to leverage scarcity and verifiable property rights. One asset class that could benefit from the addition of these physical properties is 3D print files. The global 3D printing market size was valued at USD 13.78 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.0% from 2021 to 2028.
Conceptually speaking, 3D printers are a bridge between the digital world and the physical world. Digital assets that cross this bridge become physical, but still maintain a portion of their digital properties. Hypothetically, a person could 3D print an unlimited supply of physical goods with one digital file. Furthermore there is no way to easily verify who owns the rights to these assets. By controlling these properties, through the use of Cardano minted NFTs and an intermediary application, we believe it is possible to create a massive amount of value for the 3D modeling/printing community, consumers of 3D printed goods, NFT traders and the Cardano community as a whole.
Specifically, one area of value that can be created is a ""Pay-Per-Print"" monetization scheme. 3D modelers who create functional prints (non-art use-cases) will be able to monetize their products in ways that have never been possible. Currently, selling 3D print files online is akin to selling a majority of the intellectual property for that asset (unlimited models can be printed from one file). Utilizing our printing application, creators would be able to monetize their digital IPs in the form of royalties, much like musicians earn royalties on streaming. Furthermore Pay-Per-Print files cannot be stolen or unlawfully redistributed as easily.
We believe Pay-Per-Print is our biggest value proposition. As previously stated, the 3D printing market is expected to grow to approximately 50 billion by 2028 (21% CAGR). This figure takes into account the sales of 3D printing equipment but fails to recognize the potential value of the assets being printed. 3D printers can now print houses, metal objects, aerospace quality thermoplastics, as well as injection moulded quality consumer grade plastics and various other types of plastics. 3D printing is evolving from a consumer grade hobby to having the potential to change the way we manufacture goods for decades to come. It is our belief that our project has the potential to onboard millions of users into the Cardano ecosystem with Pay-Per-Print. That being said, there are still other areas of value that our project can realize.
Another area of value that is created is the ability to cap the physical supply of 3D printed assets. This feature is extremely useful for 3D modelers who create art. Capping physical supply has the potential to increase the price of their assets if the artist is good enough to drive demand for their work. Furthermore, our application will offer the ability to issue model specific QR codes that make it possible for art consumers to verify authenticity against the blockchain if they plan to resell the model.
The last area of value that is created is the ability to cap the digital supply of 3D printed assets. This feature is useful for NFT traders and would create a secondary market that would benefit both the traders and grant more prestige to the artists. This effect can be seen on successful NFT exchanges like Rarible and Opeansea where select art pieces have sold for millions of dollars.
While value propositions and speculation are necessary for successful innovation, a detailed project plan is perhaps even more important. Getting into the specifics on how we plan to solve our defined problem statement, we propose an application suite consisting of 3 different utilities.
The first utility we propose will make it possible to achieve Pay-Per-Print. Before explaining how it's possible to control the physical supply of 3D printed assets it is first useful to know how 3D digital assets are turned into physical assets. The first step in the process starts with the 3D modeler. A 3D modeler uses a 3D design software to create a ""mesh"" of the object they want to print. This mesh consists of geometric data and nothing more. Once the mesh is complete, the modeler is able to export this file. This file is not yet 3D printable as it only consists of geometric data. In order to print this file a 3D printer needs more information on how to print the mesh. The 3D printer needs to know things like how hot to print the plastic, how fast to print the plastic, the area on the print bed where the model should be printed, fan speed, and a whole host of other parameters. This is where ""slicer software"" comes into play. A slicer software adds the necessary information to 3D mesh files that makes them 3D printable. Once this information is added to the file, the slicer communicates directly with the 3D printer via wifi to print the model.
By creating a slicing software that can communicate and verify NFT mesh files against the Cardano blockchain we will be able to control the physical supply of 3D print assets. This leads us to our second utility. A web based solution for turning 3D mesh files into Cardano minted NFTs. This utility is fairly straightforward although there are theoretically many different implementation schemes that can be achieved. This utility should be made considerably easier with the release of smart contracts in September.
The last utility we propose is an NFT marketplace. This utility will add a considerable amount of convenience to the whole experience of the platform. Similar to adding a solution for quickly minting Cardano NFTs, we believe it is important to have a way to quickly trade them. This utility should be made considerably easier with the release of smart contracts in September.
Concluding our proposed scope of this project, we plan to launch a Youtube marketing campaign. Having over 6 years experience in 3D modeling/printing as well as driving over $250,000 in revenue from a Youtube channel, our team is extremely experienced in driving traffic. We plan to release entertaining and clickable videos that demonstrate how to utilize our application through example. These videos will take you on a journey into the life of a creator as they aim to make things that you never knew were possible, utilizing tools you never knew existed.

Problem
There is a disconnect between the physical and digital world. Mobile phone credentials are still weak in some areas and phones range in technical problems for the user. Some people may not have a reliable phone or internet connection. Atala PRISM needs a simple and easy-to-use solution to help authenticate digital identity (DID) and authorize payment on-and-offline.
 
Solution
Biometric smart cards are easy-to-use and easily distributed en masse. Mobile payments and digital IDs are currently operational with-or-without smartphones or connectivity. Card-to-card transactions and card-to-phone transaction can be made on our first generation wallet with minimal fees on the Cardano blockchain.  (See the ESC ATALA PRISM PITCH DECK attached below.) 
 
General
Most adults carry some form of ID, credit card, driver's license, insurance, or government-issued card. A biometric smart card is a tamper-resistant portable storage device that can only be unlocked by the owner's biometrics (fingerprint). This provides an end-to-end authentication to ""guarantee the integrity of the platform.""  The owner of the card retains full control of their personal biometric data, identity, and access management. It can store licenses, credentials, certificates, health records, prescriptions, contracts, titles, voting, and other human activities. This technology is being rolled-out this year by a few banks and processors to reduce identity theft and other fraudulent behavior. This is a 3FA (3 factor authorization) biometric smart card; something I have (the physical card), something I know (pin code), and something I am (my fingerprint).
 
Example
If a person (Alice) wanted to get a prescription from the pharmacy, the pharmacist (Bob) could scan her card (QR code or NFC) and then Atala PRISM could help retrieve Alice's medical records and prescriptions. This would help Bob verify the right person, right prescription, and the right dose. Likewise, Bob could use his DID to access the pharmacy's controlled-substances room, check her insurance coverage, verify her doctor's orders and credentials, and process the point of sale transaction with her smart card. She is the only person that the smart card recognizes and the only one that can authorize a payment. 
 
Plan (timeline estimates)
The engineers will need to test and reload (1-3 months) the existing product's system on chip (SoC), cryptographic key tools, crypto card-to-card, card-to-phone transactions, DID integration, and firmware optimization (3 months). The overall architecture of card-to-card transactions will need to be reviewed (1-3 months) for the Cardano infrastructure. If they pass the hardware and software integration, then we can quickly prototype (3 months) the larger touch screen, larger battery, and metal finish. The business development team will be engaged (3-9 months) in connecting high value partnerships to commit to our vision. We estimate all the hardware modifications, testing, and software application can be done within $1,000,000 USD. A full redesign would take about about 12 months to go to full production of next generation (2.0) cards. (See the ESC Lean Business Plan attached below.)
 
Budget
There are a few main categories for this startup listed below. We are requesting $100,000 to help test DID integration (3 months), examine feasibility, and send prototypes to our partners for further development. The funds will be spent on engineering and startup business operations. 

R&D: (3-9 months) MVP, prototypes, firmware, middleware, embedded systems, wireless networking, encryption, back-end infrastructure, servers, services, Atala PRISM integration, mobile wallet application. 
PR and Marketing: (3-12 months) Word-of-mouth, influencers, crowd-funding campaigns, press releases, blogs, article pitches for journalists, interviews and appearances for company executives, television programs, news, outreach events for media and the public, startup promotion via social media, market research, data aggregation. 
Legal: (3-6 months) Mission, end-goal, investors, business structure, entity setup, token economics, crowd-sales, incentives, risk control, jurisdiction selection, registration, partners, employees, independent contractors, vendors, service providers, loans, lenders, co-working space, brand, IP, trademarks, copyright, patents, bank account, regulations, liabilities, insurance, accounting system, contracts (smart), advisors, exit strategy. 
IT: (1 month) Servers, software licenses, domain names, security, IT management, product SEO, tokens. 
Operational costs: (3, 6-9 months) Accounting, sales, finance, compliance, bill pay, issuing and collecting invoices, expense claims, refunds and credits, salaries, burn rate, incentives, rules and processes, fundraising, corporate development, business strategy, B2B, branding. 
Salaries: Contract, shared incentive structure, vesting schedule, token distribution, rewards.

 
Background
A member of our meetup group showed me this smart card in 2017-18. I reviewed the card (Bitcoin / Ethereum wallet) and thought it was a good candidate for the Cardano ecosystem. I thought it had potential as an Atala DID and payment wallet after some technical revisions. I asked the engineering team (former AT&T/NCR and Citibank ATM engineers) if I could white label the product and change some specifications to meet my (tough gear) specifications. They agreed to help me revise and rollout the next generation of metal biometric crypto cards. They design and manufacture tamper-proof embedded hardware security chips for mission-critical IoT devices. They own the IP for the ARTIC 1.0 chip design that protects the card platform and firmware on a system-level. The system on chip (SoC) cannot be hacked by web-level software attacks.
The hardware team (Ethernom) is currently contracting with SEA governments on other IoT products related to anonymous R0 COVID case tracking and other medical supply chain products. Our mission is to integrate IoT products like their ID/wallet with healthcare apps and enterprise supply chains.

Expanded Problem Statement
Millions of people pay billions of dollars for housing each year across Africa. However due to the informal nature of both the local affordable housing sector and its customers, those consistently making payments are largely unknown. Despite contributing the largest proportion of their income to reliably pay for housing, not being able to prove this history prevents the majority of Africans from establishing reputations of trust used to gain access to other financial services. The informal nature also creates lack of transparency and data required to codify and legitimise this direct route of housing finance to attract funds from other sources.
A Collaborative Approach
The Affordable Housing Company (Nigeria) and Casa Real (Mozambique) have partnered to help provide a solution to this problem, so that different perspectives from across the continent are taken into consideration. While we are both already delivering innovative solutions to allow more Africans currently excluded from the formal financial system, to access affordable housing through programs like lease-to-own, we would also like our customers (and those of our competitors) to benefit from the trust they establish through reliably paying for their housing.
Why Decentralised?
The unfortunate reality of economies in most African countries, means that long term stability is not certain. So while many landlords, housing or informal financing businesses may already be recording information about their customer's payment history, getting access to this information months or years into the future may be difficult if the customer moves or there are changes to the business or it ceases to exist. By recording payments on the Cardano blockchain that are associated with a customer's decentralised identity, the customer retains ownership of this information and can continue to access it in the future, regardless of whether the business they made the payments to is still operating.
Expanded Solution Description
Our proposed identity and payment tracking solution will be broken into two components, as follows:
Customer Facing - Mobile App
Mobile applications are accessible to most Africans and therefore a better option than providing access via a web browser. The following functionality will be implemented for the customer mobile app.

Customers create a decentralised identifier (DID) through Atala PRISM.
Customers enter their identity and contact information and submit an application to be considered for access to an affordable house through the lease-to-own program. NOTE: This information is not stored on the blockchain.
Customers can track the status of their application.
Successful applicants can access their account information, such as payment history, amount outstanding, etc.

Business Facing - Web App
The following functionality will be implemented for the customer account management application.

Businesses create a decentralised identifier (DID) through Atala PRISM.
Businesses review customer applications, submitted via the mobile app.
Businesses update the status of customer applications after assessing their eligibility.
Businesses issue a verifiable credential (a decentralised identity artefact) through Atala PRISM to successful applicants, after verifying the customer's identity using methods specific to their region (e.g. physical identity cards).
Businesses record payments received by customers, which are written to the blockchain against the customer's DID and updated in the mobile app.

Future Extensions
As adoption of the capabilities made available through this solution grows, additional features could be introduced to further improve the customer experience. Some examples are:

Decentralised identities introduced through trusted housing development partners are able to be used by traditional funding institutions and on emerging decentralised finance platforms, such as Empowa.
Customer identities can be verified by other trusted institutions, such as local government agencies. As agencies see adoption for Decentralised Identity solutions, they may be driven to support this through the issuance of verifiable credentials.
Evolve from tracking cash payments, to support for making payments using cryptocurrencies, such as ADA.

Application Ownership
This application will be developed as open source source software to allow other similar housing providers across Africa to leverage its capabilities for their customers.
Project Timeframes & Budget
The estimated time to completion for this project is 3 months from Atala PRISM availability. The following budget breakdown is included to support the requested funding amount.
Project Manager - 10 days: $5000
Backend/Blockchain Developer - 20 days: $15,000
Frontend/Mobile Developer - 40 days/week: $20,000

""Plasia adds value where value has traditionally been lost for students"" – building on top of the Cardano blockchain a (personal) data management and data sharing platform with integrated DID that (1) empowers students with data such as; master hours (time spent in class + time spent outside of class mastering skills, subjects, interests) and academic records such as transcripts that are accessible and validated. This data in turn births a valuable network of students who gain insight into strengths and weaknesses as well as career interests and areas of study. (2) Uses AI to connect users based on interests, skills, master hours and other records. (3) With this valuable mentorship network users explore careers that interest them based on data. Quantified data that is equitable and easily analyzable closes gaps that hinder student performance.
Roadmap
We are currently ready to onboard students at 5 Chicagoland schools and 5 local business from various industries. In conjunction, we are working with the city of Aurora, the second largest city in Illinois. The current Mayor and his staff are concerned with implementing sustainable mentorship, management and workforce development programs that reach traditionally disadvantaged groups. They have been unsuccessful so far because their strategy is focused on programs that rely on members being local in a globalized world.Our team thrives on our ability to network and build genuine relationships. We are positioned to give Cardano, Atala Prism, Learnershape and Plasia significant exposure at the education, business and government levels. The absolute focus of the first year is to help users understand what DIDs are, why they are important and how to use them safely. Furthermore, we must deploy marketing strategies that build interest around the technology. In the early adoption phase it is critical that users are educated on the technology and have a positive experience. Customer service is exceedingly important in building rapport, credibility and future success.
3 Months:
- Work with our lawyer Steve Cade at Foley & Lardner LLP in developing a data agreement focused on consent-based authorization.
- Create exceptional 3D video explaining how the technology works with @Andreaoshea_ (instagram)
- With @Andreaoshea deploy Plasia social media campaign to drive interest and educate future users
- Implement live experiential marketing with our business partner WeSixthirty (https://www.wesixthirty.com/) that records the entire process of deployment

What is Plasia
Plasia is a Chicago based startup founded in 2021 on the premise of paying students to attend school. The focal point of our foundation augments an equitable agency with tangible strategies for students to optimize their learning experience by-way-of skill authentication, data, and career audit tracking.
Plasia Today
Users' experiential interactions produce unique avenues throughout learning, whole-child development, and improve overall institutional safety. Within the traditional 1000 instructional-hours students attend classes, participate in extracurricular activities, and allocate hours for community service for projects that they feel passionate about. On the Plasia platform today, protective factors assist students on their journey by validating academic performance while also curating experiences for socially integrative responsibilities with AI. Key indicators are measured by how a student is building an effective rapport within their community through meaningful relationships, cradle-to-career solutions, peer to peer learning, and character-education development.
User Experience
   Blockchain X AI
Blockchain allows us to protect the integrity of efficient record keeping, information verification, and system accountability. Through verification strategies users' mastery hours can be improved both inside and outside the classroom where students can examine success outcomes. The data provides users a chance to optimize their agency by empowering them through master hours recorded and verified on the blockchain. Then via the Plasia platform students can monetize their data and gain insight about their own interests with help from artificial intelligence. Lastly, Master hours provide valuable data for employers and recruiters that can be sold for profit at the user's discretion.
Learnershape's Unique Artificial Intelligence Technology
 Plasia connected with the team behind Learnershape who is responsible for the exceptional ""Universal Skills Authentification"" proposal in FUND6. We have opened the door for collaboration in the future. Learnershape has developed unique technology that allows organizations to create custom AI-powered learning environments that meet today's dynamically changing industry needs. We at Plasia believe that the AI technology behind Learnershape is extremely valuable to students in the following ways:
Combine classroom learnings and student interests into specialized insights that are backed by data. (pg. 12 of the ebook [https://www.learnershape.com/])
Educational/Workforce planning & optimization

As students explore their interests, guide them toward future skills that connect to other interests and potential careers. Insightful direction powered by AI, mentored by data, and verified by blockchain (pg. 12 of the ebook [https://www.learnershape.com])

Mentorship Recommendations

Interests, skills, and data connect users to other likeminded individuals opening the door to valuable relationships
Competition psychology and in world collaboration facilitate active and long lasting engagement. As the Plasia ecosystem grows and expands new users will experience positive loop utility that far exceeds any entry costs (pg. 12 of the ebook [https://www.learnershape.com/](https://www.learnershape.com/)).

Plasia Token
The Plasia token is a native token built on the Cardano blockchain that brings simplicity into the exchange relationship between users in the Plasia platform. Members can use the native token with community-oriented businesses for purchase and/or bargaining of products with other users. This process inherently enhances financial literacy, cybersecurity, and experiential wisdom. Ideally, users will earn Plasia tokens in the same way schools earn funding; via attendance, test scores, truancy numbers etc. Later, the Plasia token is earned and exchanged in various ways as the ecosystem grows.
The Ask
With this submission we are requesting 50,000 in funding to boost our efforts to encourage Plasia, Cardano Blockchain, ATALA Prism, & Learnershape adoption. The 50k would cover the following:


Lawyer fees to draft data agreement focused on consent-based authorization -approx 10,000USD


Travel expenses as we travel to our partner schools to ensure successful deployment during 9-12 month beta test of Atala Prism/Plasia/Learnershape - approx 3,000USD


Website development for 3D Plasia web based platform that will serve to drive adoption by collecting user data like emails approx 25,000USD


Live Experiential Marketing video that records the entire beta process with designated partner schools and businesses approx 8,000USD


3D animation video marketing highlighting how these entities work together -approx 5,000 USD


Marketing campaign on various social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok) highlighting Plasia, Cardano, Atala Prism, and Learnershape approx 10,000USD


Cost for next 12 months 61,000USD


Cost for Plasia as of 9/8/21 25,000USD


Deployment
The significance of the Plasia platform serves valuable for both educational institutions and students who are creating their social enterprise. Schools that obtain the Plasia platform will remain consistent with their goal of lowering absenteeism, restorative options towards disciplinary behaviors, increase academic achievements, promoting student success, school connectedness, and culturally responsive school climate. Effective implementation is strategically designed by school administrators per their schools' yearly goals which in exchange introduces more students to the platform. As the platform expands in users it strengthens analyzable data and vitalizes the loop utility. Our next step then would be an introduction for community based businesses to join the Plasia platform to provide experiential learning and earning opportunities that benefit students directly.

It is fantastic that Atala PRISM DID solution will be used by the Ethiopian government for their students.
5 million users is amazing. However, having a really popular application that only allows authentication via decentralized ids, and in particular DIDs from Atala PRISM is needed to really bring a massive number of people into the Cardano ecosystem.
The application that I would like to build (ultimately with a team of others) could be considered a game by some, but it isn't really a game. It is a fully interactive 3D world - a metaverse if you will - that can be access from mobile, PC, or headsets (Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, or Augmented Reality). 
There will be real-time communication and an actual in-world economy backed by native token on the Cardano blockchain. It will have a robust scripting language and 3D building tools allowing the residents of this metaverse to build their own places to live, furniture, vehicles … whatever they like. They can then sell these items to other residents and buy items from others. There will be a full in-world economy and actual money can be made by being a part of this world.
Cardano NFTs purchased can be visible in-world. 2D NFTs can be brought in as images and could be placed, for example, in the resident's home they recently constructed. Since residents will be able to build their own 3D objects in the world with easy to use tools, they can actually sell them to other residents. If desired, they can actually setup a policy and mint them as NFTs.
This will ultimately be a large project, but this first part will be the minimum viable product to get started. The funds requested are to pay for my time for about 2 months so I can devote my time to this project. I may try to raise additional funding by creating NFTs that can be used in-world. If nothing else, I'll ask for more funding in the next Project Catalyst to get further functionality created.
The world is not going to be called Oasis, but I had to give a hat tip to Ready Player One. In general, I want to create something similar to SecondLife, but no duplicate or bot accounts can be created as everyone will have to have a DID.
Additionally, this will allow certain regions to be blocked off if the resident is not at least a certain age. And some things may be restricted based off the country the resident lives in the real world. Additionally, since residents can create games through the scripting language inside the world, I'm sure before long gambling games would be created and DIDs would ensure only adults could gamble. In particular, knowing if a resident is over a particular age or lives in a particular country will help tailor the experience for the individual. I want everyone to be able to enjoy the world and I want to make sure people are protected. While real names don't have to be shared, there are particular pieces of identity information that can help safeguard people.

Funding
There is enough work here for at least 2 months. As a result, I can't do this project for anything less than 32,000. This will allow me to devote my time to this project as well as pay for cloud hosting for the MVP.
If this proposal is approved by the community, I'll definitely be submitting another proposal for Fund 7.
 
Sustainability of the project moving forward
In order for this metaverse to become the go to place to connect with others and to build things and to earn an income and to relax, more funding is required to bring on more people. Besides Project Catalyst, NFTs will likely be created to help fund the project and build up excitement for it. Likewise, my stake pool can be staked to in order to help fund this project. Funding will bring on 3D artists and animators, developers, designers and marketers.
Residents can jump in the world for free. There will ultimately be a subscription model where residents will have perks like actually being land owners and getting a stipend of the native token used in-world every week. Additional land (equates to server space) can also be purchased by residents if they want a really large place - or even a private virtual island.
 
What does success look like if this proposal is funded
In 3 months after this proposal is funded, a minimum viable product (MVP) will be available to those who signed up in the private beta. Assuming we are able to integrate with Atala PRISM, we will launch the metaverse with all of the items mentioned in the MVP Deliverables section above. Within 6 months, after further funding, more team members will be added and some of the items in the roadmap will be completed - in the order that the residents desire. Within 12 months, and after even more funding, the world will be a vibrant community where people login every day to connect with friends, create, relax, and even make money by selling their creations to other residents.
 
Relative Experience
Thank you for taking the time to read this proposal and considering it.
Since you made it this far, I'm sure you are interested in my ability to actually pull this project off. My name is Chad Carter and I've been professionally developing software since graduating from college in 1996. During the last 25 years I've architected and developed multiple eCommerce systems that are used by 5% of the top Fortune 50 companies and 26 of the Fortune 500 companies along with dozen of more companies.
In 2007 I authored a book on game programming for the Xbox 360. I updated that book focusing on networking and multiplayer in 2009. Both books were best sellers. In 2012 I created my third and final book on Windows 8 programming using web technologies. Unfortunately, that book had the same fate as the operating system.
I started my own company in 2010 and have done consulting for different clients and created a new eCommerce system. In 2015 I found out about the HoloLens, and was able to purchase one of the first ones in 2016. Later in 2016 I launched LearnHoloLens.com where I taught developers how to use the HoloLens. I ran that membership for 21 months, but I had to shut it down due to the low number of HoloLens developers. I treated my business model as if it were a consumer product instead of the business product it is.
I've also created my own Cardano Stake Pool, but I've not done any marketing with it. I just found out about Cardano in March and I wanted to be a part of this upcoming transformation so I started there.
I'm completed the Plutus Pioneer Program (first cohort) and have been diving deep into the Haskell programming language and the Plutus scripting language. Besides game development, I've also worked on many projects that required Single Sign-On (SSO). I expect that experience to help integrating Atala PRISM's DIDs.
Thank you again for considering this proposal!

Use smart contracts to store customer reviews that are verifiably associated with monetary exchange. Experts build reputations they control.",2,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 05:54",Sam Gralla,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Sam-Gralla/3097990-48088,gabe.gralla,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/gabe-gralla/3100257-48088,10000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We aim to create a decentralized network of experts and learners that empowers individuals to own their reputations. We hope this network will be used for everything from Plutus consulting to gardening advice, but to start we are targeting the academic tutoring market (worth billions of dollars and growing), which is fragmented and ripe for disruption. Our brand name for this endeavor is Tutorchain—check us out at tutorchain.io.
Our business model has a centralized and a decentralized component. The centralized component is a web app that matches tutors and students based on expertise, pay, and scheduling, creating a zoom link and a smart contract for each tutoring session. The decentralized component is the smart contract, which handles payment and submission / archival of reviews. Both student and tutor review each other. We take a small percentage of the payment, with the cut decreasing for repeat users.
This approach solves several problems with existing tutoring services

COST: Flagship services (e.g. Cambridge Coaching) charge $100+ per hour and take a 50% cut from their tutors. Marketplaces like Wyzant take 25%.
MATCH: Centralized gig-economy services (e.g. chegg.com) fail to properly match tutors and students. Students say tutors are not qualified; tutors say students are not serious.
TRUST: Smaller outfits (e.g. tutormeeducation.com) struggle to gain trust of users. Can you really believe all those 5-star reviews?

We solve the COST problem by having low overhead. By using crypto smart contracts for payment, we avoid the payment-processing and accounting services that drive up prices on current marketplaces. We never hold USD, so we don't need to worry about chargebacks, and we don't need to send 1099 forms to tutors (or even collect the necessary personal information). We will be profitable with only a 5% cut, as opposed to the 25%-50% of current services.
We solve the MATCH and TRUST problems by taking a decentralized approach to customer reviews. When deciding whether to ask for or accept a gig, both tutor and student can search the immutable history of reviews and ratings of the other party, all of which are verifiably associated with monetary value and hence prohibitively expensive to fake.
Another great benefit of this approach is the international component. Current platforms require tutors to be based in the United States (or some other particular nation) in order to facilitate payment in fiat currency and ensure compliance with tax-reporting obligations associated with paying tutors as contractors. By contrast, a crypto smart-contract system has no currency exchange issues or onerous reporting requirements. We never pay the tutors--the smart contract does that. Tutors and students can just find each other and go! We expect this to awaken the sleeping giant of a truly international tutoring marketplace.
The key challenge for such a system is getting it started, since the first users have no history. Sam will use his network as a professional academic to recruit an initial crop of traditionally-vetted tutors, targeting the high-demand market of physics tutoring for pre-medical and engineering students. Once these tutors establish their independent reputations and we see user growth, we will repeat the process for other areas of academic tutoring as well as common use cases like data science consulting. Ultimately, we dream of an efficient expert marketplace where affordable help is available 24/7 on any topic, and where any expert can easily monetize their expertise, owning their reputation independently of any centralized organization.
Technical approach
The web app functions like any other marketplace: tutors and students make accounts and interact via private messages and global settings (topic, availability, etc.). After the website identifies a match (tutor, student, topic, time, pay) it sends both parties a zoom link and creates the smart contract, escrowing the funds. After the scheduled session, both parties report whether it took place and review each other, and the contract distributes funds accordingly and archives the result and reviews. It's easy to handle dishonest parties in a centralized manner since Zoom keeps track of who joined the meeting and when, and even provides automatic cloud recordings. This will be our backup as we test out decentralized verification mechanisms (tutoring DIDs), which we hope will ultimately power the service.

(We are cousins.)
Timeline
Development of the centralized component (web app) is ongoing, with the backend REST API scheduled for completion in early November. Wallet integration and smart contract development will begin as soon as the technology is ready (Plutus Application Backend finalized and browser integration available for light wallets), which is currently looking like October. We aim to have a working prototype (backend finalized, frontend prototyped) by year's end. In early 2022 we will contract out professional frontend development and recruit the initial crop of tutors. We will launch in time for summer session with just these tutors, with plans to open up the marketplace proper for Fall semester 2022.
The definition of success after 3 months is a complete backend with working wallet integration.
The definition of success after 6 months is a polished frontend and a crop of high-quality tutors.
The definition of success after 12 months is functioning decentralized marketplace!
Campaign suitability
Since our business spans several F6 themes, we were advised to propose in multiple categories. This proposal supports the digital identity side of our business: To use the system, tutors/experts must be confident that they will grow a valuable reputation, and students/learners must trust the reputations they see. (Students can also grow a reputation in order to secure the best tutors.) This means that our network must be independently sybil-resistant (zoom recordings give us good access to data, but simple social network analysis might be enough), or we must partner with a complete digital identity solution like Atala prism. We are requesting $10k in funds to test both approaches to digital identity.
Why should Catalyst voters support this project?
While the business can in principle run on any blockchain, Cardano is our top choice. We love the focus on peer review, the patience to do things right, the vision for decentralized governance, and the spectacular decentralization already achieved (70% staked across 3000 pools!). And we both love a good ""geek out"" on the lambda calculus. This money will get us started on the best chain out there.
We think that our business has a clear near-term path to success. This can attract other developers to Cardano now, giving a boost against the common ""lack of developer buy-in"" criticism. The long-term success of our business will grow the value of the ADA token.

Background and motivation
iRespond is a privacy-protecting biometric service provider who serves vulnerable populations including refugees, migrant workers, study participants, and others. We recognize Self-Sovereign Identity, Verifiable Credentials, and public blockchains like Cardano as being fantastic tools to empower developing populations including in Africa and Asia to become more successful, even in the face of the agents of corruption around them.
Problem Statement
Verifiers must be convinced of a subject's. Identity, based on what they hold, know, and who they are. The ""who"" is often missing.
Proving who you are and the credentials you've earned over your lifetime is essential to empowerment. However, the ability to prove these things is sometimes fragile when paper credentials are lost or when it is difficult to prove who you really are while just a smartphone.
To create an ecosystem for digital identity and credentials requires trust relationships between credential issuers, subject, holders, verifiers, and governing authorities. Establishing trust is actually harder than just deploying the technology. From a credential holder's perspective, e.g., the one who has an Atala PRISM wallet, they need to prove to a verifier they really are the credentials recipient subject.
Solution
Biometrics help one prove their identity. An Identity Binding Credential will link an individual's DID and their biometric template.
iRespond is one of many centralized biometric service providers (BSPs) who can provide a strong level of assurance that an individual holding and presenting their credentials to a verifier is indeed the subject of the credential. IRespond's UNiD Node application already in production and deployed in Thailand, Myanmar, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, and other locations provides reliable identification of individuals based on a scan of their irises. We reliably produce a 12-digit unique numeric identifier (UNiD) for each individual that can be reliably used within other systems for healthcare, study tracking, work permits, and more. iRespond's solution doesn't track traditional PII attributes such as name, birth data, government ID, or address.
With this proposed project, the product will be extended to be able to produce an identity binding verifiable credential once an individual has had their irises scanned and after receiving a proof-of-DID-ownership (e.g., by signing a message with one of the keys listed in the DID Document). The credential would be similar to this: ""IRespond and the Operator X attest that the individual with UNiD 123456789012 and did:cardano:addr1xyz appeared live and was identified with dual iris scan with extremely high confidence (with supporting false accept rate and false reject rate).""
This Identity Binding VC would be issued to the DID holder with a QR code and could be imported into the Atala PRISM wallet for later presentation, adding trust, especially when the verifier can also utilize iRespond's UNiD Node to prove the individual's UNiD identifier.
Services could be built on top of that basic VC to also attest/notarize existing government-issued documents.
Many biometric service providers will be able to play in this ecosystem to accelerate the mass-scale adoption of Atala PRISM DIDs and VCs. Individuals, governments, and companies will not be vendor-locked. Nor BSP identity provider will have a treasure trove of PII. This is completely unlike India's Aadhaar!
Addressing the Challenge Question
What will drive mass-scale adoption of decentralized IDs on Cardano?  Biometric Identity Binding Credentials will help establish trust between the roles within an SSI ecosystem, especially between a verifier and a holder when the stakes are high, such as with property/real estate transfers or guardianship scenarios.
Milestones
3 months - Pilot deployment of 5 iRespond UNiD Nodes into an existing Cardano project, e.g. in Ethiopia schools.
6 months - Identity binding credentials issued and read by Atala PRISM.  Public launch, assuming Atala PRISM features are public by then.
12 months - Solution deployment in pilot extended to end-to-end use cases of trusted issuers, holders, verifiers, and governance authorities.  Additional deployments within India and SE Asia.
Budget
$30,000 for product development (mostly staffing)
$20,000 for pilot equipment, licensing for 5 years, and training
$25,000 for staff and travel consulting with other issuers, verifiers, and governance authorities, including developing trust framework and registries, if needed.

The population in Brazil (literally anyone) can send bills of popular initiative to the Chamber of Deputies. The Federal Constitution requires the signature of one percent of voters, distributed across at least five states of the Federation. In each of them, it takes at least three tenths of the voters. 
The big problem is because there is no public and transparent database where voters could submit their proposal or browse among other proposals, see which proposals were presented or even contribute with a different proposal, this does not exist, the government does not have these features, it has a very archaic website with a PDF where you'll collect people's paper signatures, which makes everything more difficult and bureaucratic.
The idea would be to build a platform that uses Atala PRISM DID, through this platform, Brazilian citizens could submit ideas or contribute with ideas already presented. Bills with verifiable and auditable blockchain signatures will leave the government with no way out. We are talking about a platform for 211 million users, the current Brazilian population. In the future, this platform could be used for plebiscites, referendums or even elections through universal suffrage, and could be adapted to other countries.
We would like to build a pool associated with this platform, fees collected from the pool would be directed to a Maintenance and Development Fund, we would also like to establish an incentive paid in ADA for people who are able to submit and pass bills.

In the last decade there has been a push from world health organizations and the healthcare industry to move health records into the digital age. As a consequence hundreds of companies have developed and deployed their custom solutions. But as the different systems grow, the interoperability between the systems have become an issue.
For example, if a patient has an electronic record in one hospital and needs a procedure that's only provided by another hospital; how the later hospital will have access to the patient information? Are the records compatible? Most likely not.
In order to help with this problem presented on the simple scenario above, the HL7 organization was created; from which multiple standards have been developed. The latest been HL7 FHIR Specification 4.
However this standard does not deal with identities across institutions.
Our proposal is to provide a headless HL7 FHIR API solution that uses Atala PRISM and the sole Identification source, and open source it. Headless in this scenario means that we will provide the backend and an administration portal for configuring it, so that multiple companies, countries or individuals can build their custom applications on top of it. By utilizing the Atala Prism and W3C recommended Distributed IDs (DID) we present a solution to manage identities across-domain. Our solution will be the first Distributed Patient Record Management System on Cardano.
In short, we provide the backend source code and documentation on how to configure it and how to build applications for it. Our hope is that through helping multiple companies and government organizations to build their products on top of our framework, thousands of new patient records will be successfully tracked on the Cardano blockchain.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
A decentralized court would provide the key infrastructure required to build a wide range of valuable products and services. The initial focus would be on creating a system for community issued certificates where anonymous users are incentivized to correctly issue certificates based on submitted evidence of authenticity. Cardano, with it's integrated Atala PRISM DID framework, is uniquely suited to support this specific concept.
The underlying protocol will take inspiration from and function similarly to the Ethereum based Kleros (https://kleros.io/static/whitepaper_en-8bd3a0480b45c39899787e17049ded26.pdf) and Aragon Court (https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper). These two projects are testaments to the integrity of the game-theoretic model.
 
Sample use cases for community issued certificates

While creating Tip Genius, an automated video game coaching tool built on the knowledge of many reputable coaches (https://www.overwolf.com/app/Ben_Mesnik-Tip_Genius), I found it difficult to find the right coaches. Popular online marketplaces for connecting with coaches were plentiful with listings, but not all listings were wholly accurate in representing the coach's talent. Certificates of coaching prowess and player skill could be helpful in this regard, and these could be sourced reputably and efficiently by the community of gamers.

 

Throughout my participation in the first cohort of Plutus Pioneers I encountered a number of individuals who, although fully partaking in the lectures/coursework and engaging in the discord, weren't officially enrolled in the cohort and thus won't receive the certification they deserve. A community issued 'Honorary First Cohort Plutus Pioneer' certification for those who can prove to a court they were actively involved in the program could fairly and accurately reward these pioneers.

 

As an avid traveler and former intern at TripAdvisor I've witnessed firsthand that the centralized approach to awarding a ""Certificates of Excellence"" for top travel related businesses can be flawed. Certificates based on some secretive algorithm that sources it's data only from the reviews left on the issuers website leaves room for skepticism and inaccuracy. A ""Certificate of Excellence"" that's based on all available information, is publicly verifiable, and refutable might hold more merit.

 
 
Roadmap
The goal is to build out the court protocol and integrate it with Atala PRISM's DID framework, this is the general roadmap for how it'll be done
In the next 0-3 Months

Hire an experienced Haskell developer (to join me as a Plutus developer)
Participate in the Atala PRISM pioneer program
Work on the base functionality of the court - jury selection, voting, appeals

In the next 3-6 Months

Continue working on the the base functionality of the court - jury selection, voting, appeals
Work on the Atala PRISM DID integration flow - creation of DID for applicant, issuance of certificate on contract output
Implement a web interface for interacting with the court

In the next 6-12 Months

Code is audited and thoroughly tested
Public launch
Release a proof of concept certificate that authenticates Valorant (the video game) coaches using the court, certified Tip Genius coaches can advertise their credentials in the app next to their socials.

 
Risks/Open Questions

Will people actively build on top of the protocol?
Is there a flaw in the incentives model?
How seamlessly will the DID creation and certificate issuance integrate?
How many jurors will be needed for people to trust the verdicts for different certificates? Will it be cost-effective in enough cases?

How would this drive Atala PRISM DID mass-scale adoption?
This proposal would create the infrastructure needed to issue reputable certifications without a trusted organization. This new paradigm could be used by anyone to improve current and create previously unfeasible certifications, leading to more Atala PRISM based DID certifications being issued and used.

*** Impact on Challenge Metrics ***
DIDs and Verifiable Credentials are being rapidly adopted to implement secure, privacy-respecting digital identity solutions following the SSI model of decentralized digital ID. EU governments, Canada, India, and other countries are moving strongly to roll out the issuance of digital credentials (as VCs that leverage the DID/VC standards) to their citizens. Government-issued ID will continue to be the gold standard for personal identification, and this activity will unlock tremendous opportunities for extensible private sector use cases for DIDs and VCs.
The current preferred standard for anchoring DIDs and VCs is to utilize Hyperledger Indy networks, where the Sovrin MainNet Ledger is the trusted leader. For Cardano to become a leading provider of ""public identity infrastructure,"" there must be smooth interoperability delivered by applications that utilize the most popular identity ledgers.
It is also important to understand that there is unlikely to ever be ""one ledger to rule them all"" in the identity space, and smooth interop is the gateway to maximum user adoption. We can then expect users to gravitate over time toward the most efficient and trusted ledgers for their digital identity needs.
THEREFORE, the gating item for low-friction adoption of Cardano as a global public identity utility is to have VC issuer/verifier platforms and digital ID wallet apps that flexibly utilize Cardano and other ledgers, with minimal user distraction. Interop is crucial in the SSI-space, especially to secure support within and between governments. To be successful, any VC/DID platforms that utilize the Cardano ledger must be interoperable with other popular ledgers – particularly Hyperledger Indy.
The CARDANO INTEROP NOW project exactly delivers a VC issuer/verifier platform and a FREE open-source digital identity wallet to accelerate the adoption of Cardano as a premier global digital identity utility.
 
*** Timeline ***
The following goals will be completed within three months after the project start. Our proven team, with world-class expertise in digital identity, SSI, and distributed ledger tech, will deliver:
1. A DID/VC issuer and verifier platform (based on our existing product) that incorporates Cardano ledger interoperability with other ledgers (i.e. Indy), and
2. an open-source digital wallet that supports VCs anchored on Hyperledger Indy and Cardano blockchains, supported and hosted by the Digital Identity Trust Foundation (www.digitalidentitytrust.org).
 
*** Use fo Funds (US$-equivalent) ***
• Architectural design of Cardano and Hyperledger Indy interop = $18,000
• Modify existing VC issuer/verifier platform to support Cardano interop = $28,000
• Modify existing opensource VC wallet to support Cardano interop = $18,000
• Expanded server costs & other technical infrastructure = $3,000
• Additional UI/UX design developers = $11,000

Tldr;
A hosted open-source software where everybody can issue and claim certificates. Simple sign up with your organization and create the certificates based on existing requirements and invite others to claim that certificate.
The service consists of an API and a white-label frontend every organization can brand to it own needs.
 
Introduction
Trust in proven ability, safe products or verified compliance with certain requirements is an important building block of an evolving society. In the industrialized nations, everything is now certified: Buildings, products, machines, tools, but above all educational programs: Participation in training, passing exams, and having certain skills or knowledge. From a university degree to a yoga class around the next corner.
 
Market
These certificates are awarded by an almost infinite number of large and small companies or public institutions. These institutions all have their own lists of requirements, processes, and complex certificate structures: sometimes it is a snapshot of a certain level of requirements that is valid for life, sometimes they expire after a certain time and require recertifications. In other cases, a series of selectable basic certificates must first be earned before the final certificate is issued automatically. The processes involved are as varied as the companies and organizations themselves.
 
Product
Instead of a specific solution for a certain group of interested parties, this is a proposal for a generic solution with the following features:

White label: the solution can be adapted by the certificate issuers to their own brand. Since most certification companies earn money with certifications, a technical solution must be 100% white label capable.
Generic: The typical certification requirements must all be covered. These include expiring certifications that need to be renewed and certificate modules that build on each other. The certificate issuer must be able to replicate their existing certificates from the analog world.
Open Source: With the development of an open source solution, other community projects can build on this solution to drive concrete implementations at specific universities, companies and organizations in a second stage.
Showcase SaaS: A major barrier to adoption of certifications over the blockchain will initially be the level of abstraction. This proposal includes not only the open source software development, but also a free service as a multi-tentant SaaS solution that organizations and businesses can use as a playground.
Reduced complexity: In order for organizations to use certificates on the blockchain, some simplification is required. For both the issuer and the certificate recipient, the focus must be on the presentation of the certificate rather than the technical dependencies.
PRISM: Integration with Atala.PRISM should be enabled for both the issuer and the certified party.

This sums up to 83,200 USD. As a professional software developer this isn't attractive to pursue considering the classic under-estimation problems of software development. For a community – on the other hand – it is a lot to ask for, and I believe it is even too much. Therefor, I would take 40% of the estimated costs from my on pocket, being a community project from which we all would profit in the long term. This way the requested amount is reduced to 49,920 USD
Getting on the road
Within 3 months after project start (directly after funding)

Creation of a POC with different certification templates:  Lifetime certificate, Expiring certificate with recertification process, Lego block system with certificates which build upon each other

  Within 6 months after project start

Build out to a production ready solution
Create documentation and onboarding material

Within 12 months

A SaaS is hosted for free for everybody to try out 
The open-source solution is still maintained and other developers are encouraged to participate and use the software to further facilitate the adoption of DIDs and certifications on Cardano

 
Defining success

A working SaaS solution can be successfully tested by interested parties to get an impression of DIDs and certification solutions on the Cardano platform. 
The OpenSource project is available to the community to develop further certification models. The Project can freely be used by user companies which would like to roll their own certification-system or offer certification solutions to customers.
PRISM finds a concrete application:  Initially by interested parties, who try out what is possible with certifications and DIDs.  In the second step, through adoption by companies and organizations that recognize the advantages of certification on the blockchain and that the technical hurdles are not as high as expected.

Technical implementation
.Net core, VUE, Azure; Plutus; DID integration depending on SDK available
Reference of recent projects: https://www.gulp.de/gulp2/g/spezialisten/resume/bsandmann
 
Conclusion
It is important to have a hands-on example where interested parties and companies can easily explore and establish their existing certification business on the blockchain. In the long term, this will work as a catalyst for further developments and increases the chance that companies will consider actually taking these certifications into operation – and therefor increase the real-world usages of DIDs.

******
Which of the following sample addresses would be easier to use when interacting with dApps and wallets?
addr123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrst
OR
alice.address
Wallet and dApp providers that adopt the DARP protocol can give their end users a better experience, as they will be able to use easy to remember address names, instead of long and complex strings of characters. Developers can also use DARP to simplify changes to smart contract addresses without needing to deploy a full update to their applications.
How does it work?
The DID standard defined by the W3C on which Atala PRISM is built, provides a service property (https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#services) that allows the owner of the DID to refer those they want to interact with, to information that may be of use in communicating with them. This is specified using the serviceEndpoint attribute, that can be a URL, a messaging service or other communications protocols.
The DARP protocol will use this service feature to leverage the use of DIDs being made available through Atala PRISM, to allow the owner of a human readable address (e.g. alice.address) to refer others to a resolution document, which maps their human readable address to complex addresses, such as a Cardano wallet address.
For those that would like a more technical overview, please review the documentation at https://docs.darp.tech
How does this service drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage and Atala PRISM?
This kind of service is something that many users of Cardano (or any other blockchain) would find useful, be it developers building dApps or end users wanting to interact with dApps or simply transfer tokens. By providing this service as an extension of the underlying capabilities of DIDs, it introduces people to Atala PRISM before there are other identity solutions that may be of use to them. This will grow the adoption of Atala PRISM, allowing other identity solutions for future applications easier to introduce, as many users will already be onboarded with a DID.
Similar services (like the Ethereum Name Service or Unstoppable Domains) already exist, why build an alternative on Cardano?
In addition to being built on ageing technology with scaling problems, existing services also use smart contracts to store address information on the blockchain. While this does decentralise the name resolution service, it unnecessarily adds bloat to the blockchain with data that doesn't necessarily need to be immutable. These services can also become costly through their use of gas.
The philosophy of Cardano in building a third generation blockchain solution, is that it improves on the way that other blockchains have done things in the past. This is the same philosophy being used by DARP, to realise the same benefits that the early service implementations provided, but without the shortcomings they experience.
Deliverables
The requested funds will be used as follows:
1. Develop all the capabilities of a Decentralised Address Name Registrar (as described in the documentation), which will:

Allow users to register a DID/DID Document
Allow users to register an Address Name
Allow users to edit and store their Address Resolver Document (described in the documentation)
Issue a Verifiable Credential for a registered Address Name
Allow users to update their DID with the serviceEndpoint of their Address Resolver Document (ARD)

2. Test querying the registry, verifying Address Name ownership and resolving an address using the ARD
3. Document the DARP protocol and how developers can build support for its use in their applications
4. Make code used to build a Decentralised Address Name Registrar open source so others (e.g. Stake Pools) can provide the same service
 
Timeframes
Work is expected to be completed within 4 - 6 months, subject to completion of support for Decentralised Identity artefacts (i.e. DID Documents, Verifiable Credential Templates, DID resolution, etc.) on Cardano, following the release of Atala PRISM.

MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEM
This challenge focus on DID initiative on the Cardano blockchain with the potential scale to the mass market. The DID for the climate impact could be the identity of 8 billion people on the planet.
Fighting climate change is probably the biggest challenge ahead of us. Nature is giving us strong signals about it.
Here are some stats: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide
Human activities have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, amplifying Earth's natural greenhouse effect.
The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago.
We need to fight climate change by reducing carbon emissions and carbon in the air.
But climate change sounds too big of an issue for each person. We feel powerless.
 
MY CARBON ZERO
Going carbon zero means taking responsibility for all of the carbon you have ever emitted and you can track and manage it through MyCarbonZero platform
""My Carbon Zero"" inspires people to take action against climate change. Each person's action counts and cumulative efforts will have cumulative results
To fight COVID we have masks, social distance, and get vaccinated. To face climate change we can take simple actions that will make an impact. But it all starts with the dynamic DID climate impact.
 
My Carbon Zero is being developed under the leadership of Scott Poynton (see more at the team) and phase 1 is already ongoing and could be found at https://mycarbonzero.org/
 
Each one of us will:
1. Know the lifetime carbon footprint - the good news is that individually it is not that high
2. Can take simple action to mitigate it and reduce the footprint - each one of us can take it to zero
3. Communicate it (i.e. in your CV/Linkedin) and get incentives - to enable scale
 
Please login and check your Life carbon impact as well as go through the available resources.
 
THE SOLUTION
We are now developing the next phase which will include the DID carbon footprint, improved UI/UX, and partnerships with web platforms (more below)
1. The Platform - calculate, take action, get incentives
    * Calculate your dynamic DID carbon footprint - in this stage, you will know your life carbon footprint balance
    * Auto calculate or self calculate (3min) LIFE time carbon footprint - the good news is that it will be an amount that can be mitigated
 
2. Calculate current daily carbon footprint - based on the country you live in and lifestyle (electricity, heat, transportation, buying stuff, food). This will be part of your ongoing carbon footprint ad on
   * Present ways to reduce your carbon - which will be connected to your dynamic carbon DID
   * How to support projects reducing their carbon footprint
   * Support projects reducing carbon already in the atmosphere
 
The list of projects to support will be vetted making sure the impact is verified. Here are few examples of projects we already work with (more can be found on our website):

3. Share & get incentives
   * Share your DID footprint, add it to your CV/Linkedin
  * Compare it with others at your social network/work
  * Get rewards and incentives through collaboration with corporates (such as travel brands) and crypto models (NFT trees, crypto rewards)
 
SCALE & INCENTIVES
One of the aspects of this challenge is the ability to scale the DID. MyCarbonZero is relevant for everyone and it could be a cross-border identity based on common values and shared objectives to mitigate climate change. MyCarbonAction will scale fast through collaboration with corporates and through social sharing.
One example is Travel Industry partnerships - the team has a strong network with leading travel websites (i.e. Expedia) and hotel booking platforms. The idea is to integrate MyCarbonZero at the end of the booking process and through that get exposed to a highly engaged audience.
The partnerships with the brands will also include incentives for those users taking action. For example:
If a user reaches a 0 carbon impact, he/she will be entitled to special discounts with brands.
One strong partnership we are already evaluating is with https://www.goodwall.io/ with access to 1.7 million young members. The idea is to involve their community with climate action activities.
Other collaborations could be discussed with Bio & environmental networks, Universities, corporates employees, and even platforms like Linkedin and Facebook where users could post their Climate Impact balance (very big statement).
We also see potential partnerships with other applications on the Cardano ecosystem, for example as part of a microfinance app that could give some preference to DID with 0 climate impact.
In the years to come, climate change will be a huge deal and many businesses and community members need to find simple ways to act. We wish to start a ripple effect to make MyClimateAction a discussion around the meeting rooms and dining tables around the globe.
The key is to make it very simple to calculate, take action, communicate, and get incentives.

BUDGET
MyCarbonZero has very ambitious objectives and it is already on its way while we are securing some support for it from corporates clients. We need however support to bring it to the next level with a focus on UI, platform tech development, and DID implementations.
The majority of the funds will be dedicated to the product development that will be managed by Udai and based in Calcutta India where the cost of development is relatively low. We calculate the budget across a period of 6-9 months so it gives us time to progress while also securing more funds from clients, grants, and impact investors. This next phase, working on the UI, MVP, DID, and collaboration with Cardano will make it more attractive for other parties as well to support the venue. We estimated additional funding sources within 6 months' time and until then we will operate with a modest budget as part of our engagement for the important cause.
 
- Development team - 2-3 developers based in India. $1000 per month per developer. Overall budget $20,000
- Design user flow and interface UI & UX - 15% of position support over 3-6 months with $1,000. Overall budget $4,500 (A normal rate for Zachi will be double as he is highly demanded)
- Project management $1,000 for 6 months - total budget $6,000
- Marketing and partnerships $1,000 for 6 months - total budget $6,000
- Graphic designer $1,000
- Marketing materials and presentations $1,000
- Content, admin and other $2,000
 
Total budget $40,500
 
CHALLENGES:
There will be challenges on the way to success, here are some:
 
- Challenge 1 - making it very simple for users
Climate change seems a huge issue and we are powerless.
How can make everyone feel they can and should contribute to fighting climate change? How can we make users understand it is possible to get to 0 negative impact? How to make the user flow very simple and fast?
This will be a prime objective while designing the solution.
 
- Challenge 2 - motivate users to take action
People need to take action to change their lifestyle and contribute financially to reduce their Carbon. We need to make it easy and inspire people to do it. Creating incentives will be important to drive action.
 
- Challenge 3 - Business model
To continue to grow and scale, we will need to prove and improve the business model which is today based on the corporate social responsibility budget and we need to move to a more mainstream revenue model. This will be part of the ongoing work in the next 6 months. Our goal is to generate revenue so we can sustain the growth.
 
- Challenge 4 - Team collaboration
As an international team, communication and coordination between the team members is essential for the success. This also includes the collaboration with the Cardano and Atala Prism teams
 
- Challenge 5 - Partnerships for scale
Partnerships with leading companies have the risk of the speed of implementation and priorities. We need to find the right motivation and process to make this partnership effective.
 
SUMMARY
DID for climate impact is done at timing it is needed most and the objective is to make a global universal climate DID. The project already started and we put together a strong diverse team to take it to the next level. An important basic part of the solution will be the development of the DID and connection to the Cardano ecosystem and Cardano community. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to evaluate the proposal. We welcome any feedback, questions, and suggestions. We also welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to the success of the venture. We appreciate the CA, VCA, and voters time and attention.

White Paper for project with a detailed description and context:
Trusting the Trustless: Extending Sovereignty through a Passive Interface.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n9KN5dY3XXFmbjf9XKte93s8JAworKnC/view?usp=drivesdk
 
Note: ""Trustless"" is a reference to descriptions used when describing cryptographic-based governance structures created using smart contracts or other automated processes. They do not require you trust a human to carry out agreed upon terms. Human communities create the terms of the governance. They are then implemented via machine processes. 
 
A Paired Device: The Passive Interface and Reader
The Passive Interface and Reader comprise a unique method to validate the identity of a sovereign individual, resulting in the creation of a DID, (Decentralized Identity). This DID, or proof of identity allows the individual to securely connect to the Cardano Blockchain and perform transactions. These transactions are of multiple types, including web3 transactions.
It is available in remote or rural areas, where there may be little or no internet service. It is not intended to replace biometric DID solutions, but merely offers an alternative that may be useful as the user-base of Cardano expands. It also provides a basis for empirical research to consider what we may gain by shifting our focus away from legacy screen-based methods of interface. 
 
The Passive Interface
The Passive Interface in this iteration, can be defined as a tactile physical object that requires no active electronic circuitry to function. It can be worn or held, and is in possession of the User. It does not require the use of a cell phone or other networked connection.
For those familiar with blockchain, it is in a sense like a hardware wallet, which stores information needed to perform transactions. Only it is not an active device. It can not be altered through environmental changes. It has no batteries. It is not useful for the perpetrator if stolen. There is no seed phrase. It only has purpose for the owner of it—the physical human being—and it fits within their cultural system of reference. It is not meaningless to those who created and possess it. It is not designed to be disposable. It is like a fossil. Over time, its meaning persists
If blockchain transactions are immutable, (have an indelible persistence):
An Object, such as a Passive Interface becomes a parallel trace of immutable history.
 
The Reader
The Passive Interface is paired with a unique DNA validation method, which is the Reader of the information stored within it. .
These two components, work together, to validate a user, and then provide access to the blockchain, in remote or rural areas, where there may be little or no internet service. It is not intended to replace biometric identifier solutions, but merely to offer an alternative solution as the user-base of Cardano expands.
 
The Passive Interface/DNA validation pair provides a safe and secure DID which minimizes the exploitation of online biometric ID validation schemes which can be used for other surveillance interests and violation of privacy. This is of great concern to indigenous communities and is becoming an increasing concern for the broader population. These online biometric methods are often seen as prohibitive when considering engaging on blockchain.
 
Research Opportunity: Moving away from the Screen-based interface
This research and development opportunity provides a basis for empirical studies, to consider what we may gain by shifting our focus away from legacy screen-based models of interface. And it opens the door to explore recent scientific discoveries in material science and mathematics which provide new insights for connecting our physical being to data, without storing it in a manner which creates unintended opportunities for surveillance or the invasion of privacy by centralized authorities.
It emerged through the practice of an open laboratory concept, which is an exchange of ideas, and open thinking which build upon discovery from multiple human beings, spanning multiple disciplines, engaging in synchronistic exchanges.More on this in the white paper.
 
How I am addressing the challenge question?
The challenge states that a proposal can include DID solutions other than the Atala PRISM biometric-based solution. My solution presents an alternative, and could not be understood fully without being considered within the context of the Atala PRISM or other biometric DID solutions. I carefully read the language of the challenge. And chose carefully when placing it here.
 
Considering the language of the Challenge:
Begin quote from challenge:
Propose a means or way to drive mass-scale adoption of DID usage as an easy-to-use onramp to the Cardano ecosystem (preferably Atala PRISM when released). This can include any method that will offer users or entities a decentralized ID to start defining their digital self-sovereignty.
(Note from proposer: using preferably rather than must use leaves it open for proposers to include any method, as stated in the last sentence above)
While we prefer to support Atala PRISM's instantiation of DID, this is more about building ideas and concepts that require DID to draw users to the Cardano platform. And since PRISM is building to the open standards, those are available for anyone to imagine possibilities and offer proposals.
Note from proposer: again the use of prefer but clearly not requiring the use of Atala PRISM, and explicitly stating this is about building ideas and concepts that draw users to the Cardano platform.
My proposal would help many communities—who are not familiar with the language of screen-based interface, who may intentionally not have smart phones or screen-based devices, or access to the internet— a means to access the Cardano platform with little to no cost. It allows for different cultures and ancestral histories to be supported without forcing them to learn a screen-based language which may go against their ancestral or cultural beliefs. And hopefully we who are fluent in this language can learn from testing this type of engagement.
And as mentioned above, it alleviates concerns for the exploitation of online biometric DID validation, which may be exploited for unnecessary surveillance and intrusion of privacy.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Motivation/ Problem
After creating your DID in AtalaPrism e.g. on your mobile phone, the next logical step is to get your government ID into your AtalaPrism Account (DID). This is required to use AtalaPrism to its full potential and e.g. get access to municipal or financial services.
However, there are some problems

your government needs to issue digital IDs
your government needs to accept AtalaPrism as a valid storage for this ID
you need to physically go to a local government office to get this done

To improve mass scale adoption of AtalaPrism, we must address these problems.
Solution/Proposal
You already have a document which is verifying your identity and is issued by your government, your passport. In lots of countries this is already an ePassport as defined by the UN (Today around 150 countries and regions are issuing ePassports). Which means it includes an NFC chip an is therefore machine readable / can be read electronically.
Modern smartphones often include an NFC module and can read your ePassport.
I therefore propose a way to use your ePassport and smartphone to create a governemt ID in AtalaPrism
This improves mass scale adoption because the issuance of a valid digital government ID, stored in AtalaPrism, is now a self service which does not require a physical visit to a government office, but only an NFC enabled smartphone and ePassport.
Approach
To achive this, I want to create a smartphone app (android) which replaces the local government office and issues the government ID. The working title of the app is ""ePassReader"".
The general concept is the following:

ePassReader reads ePassport via NFC
ePassReader creates a digital government ID based on the passport data
ePassReader creates corresponding QR code
AtalaPrism app scans QR code and adds government ID to credentials list

The specific goal is to create a working prototype of ePassReader which works with the german ePassport. This requires to become a corresponding service provider
This general approach should produce the following results:
Results after 3 month


be a registered a service provider to be allowed to read data from the german ePassport


https://www.ausweisapp.bund.de/en/ausweisapp2-home/


evaluation of AtalaPrism SDKs and APIs


knowledge about how to create and structure credentials in AtalaPrism


basic version of ePassReader which allows NFC reading in general


Results after 6 month

version of ePassReader which allows reading german ePassport
first integration of AtalaPrism API in ePassReader

Results after 12 month


working prototype of ePassReader which allows


reading german ePassport


creation of valid QR code to import the government ID


optimized UI of ePassReader


concept to include additional countries/ePassports


A public beta version of ePassReader should be available ca 1-1.5 years after project start
 
Funding

80% personnel costs (one full time developer for one year)
10% possible hardware and software
10% possible fees in the process of becoming a german Online ID service provider

The Nightmare
Lisa (29) recently found out from the sad faces at her Brook Neighborhood meeting that their old library was finally torn down. Wanting to lift their spirits, she meets with an old friend, Jose, at a local organization. It turns out they are offering a small grant for community projects that could help her buy a vacant lot where the community could build a simple structure, a modest lending library she's calling 'Brook's Books.'
The nightmare scenario occurred two weeks later when she looked down at her phone notifications and saw 13 fraudulent charges from her bank, a plane ticket purchased with her Passport, and a transcribed voicemail from her Grantor informing her of a recent data breach––all the Grantee information in their files had been hacked! 
The Solution
After a couple of weeks, all the headaches of replacing her bank cards, credit cards, and a few different forms of ID that she had used in her grant application process, Lisa finally finished getting things back on track. A problem solver at heart, she begins to research the topic and find a solution. ""There has to be another way,"" she thinks.
Over her search, she comes upon something called the Cardano Grants Management System. After digging a little deeper, she sees that they would both benefit from using the system that will protect her new credentials inside of an integrated solution called Atala PRISM.
The Technical Director, Susan, takes a look at the platform and afterward gives Jose her approval to use the software, saying, ""I'm excited! It could really be a movement forward in helping us to restore integrity to our data security and keep our name and hard-won reputation safe in the community."" Jose feels confident with her assessment, and they get started right away with Lisa's new application.*
*More on that story in our Fund7 proposal ;)
Overview: Our software platform that will help Grantees and Grantor (just like Lisa and Jose) safely and securely transfer and verify sensitive credentials will take 12 months to build.
Roles/Budget:
Nyagatare: Project management, Onboarding Grantor Community Members
Benjamin: Content Management, Onboarding Grantee Community Members
Note: both team members are requesting $1000 each per month for their roles in the process ($6000 total)
Development Team: In a conversation with a highly reputable functional programmer, the price for contracting the development team is estimated at $75,000 in total (including upkeep and other aspects of ongoing support). Our project is 12 funded months, so we ask for $19,000 per round to cover this cost.

Proposal team budget: $6000
Dev. team estimated budget: $19,000

Note: We will keep rigorous records and update Catalyst at all requested times. If there are any leftover funds, we will see that they are returned to the Catalyst Treasury.
 
Goal 1 (pre-funding): (present - Oct 27, 2021)
Budget: $0
Our short term goals before funding are to complete the following: 
Business Structure: Finalize legal business structure for Cardano Grants Management Systems. 
White Paper: The conceptual framework behind the software platform (coming soon to the website)
Website: This will be continually updated with any new news on our project, whether or not Fund6 funds us.
Marketing: We will continually update our website, Catalyst Town Hall, Discord servers, and other social media.
Securing Developers: Though in talks with potentials, we will contract our developer after funding arrives.
Goal 2 (Fund6): (Oct 28, 2021 - Jan 31, 2022)
Budget: $25,000
$1000 per/mo for 3 months each = $6000. 
$19,000 is the figure we were given to higher a contracted development team to build the first
Definition of Success: To produce a working prototype of our software platform that can be tested in the field in real-world cases. To go through the proposal process for Fund7.
Details:
Within the span of this funding round, we will formalize our business structure, begin our work with our Development (Dev.) Team to create a working prototype of our software program and test its functionality. We will do this by collaborating with potential end-users to determine the platform's efficacy and learn about other issues to address in the final version of our software platform (see Goal 3).
Concurrent with this process, Nyagatare and Benjamin will build relationships and collaborations with potential end-users (Grantors and Grantees) who will be the first users of the prototype.
Public Launch Date (Prototype): Jan 31, 2022
 
Goal 3 (Fund7): (February 1 - April 30, 2022)
Budget: $25,000
$1000 per/mo for 3 months each = $6000.
$19,000 for the second installment of development team total cost of $75,000
Definition of Success: To produce a finalized and thoroughly tested v1 of the software platform capable of solving reliability and security issues in the grant application process. To go through the proposal process for Fund8.
Details:
After testing the prototype in Goal 2 is complete, the Dev. The team will take the input from these real-world users and iterate further to finalize the software platform into a full version 1 (v1) product that integrates directly with Atala PRISM and archives the goals of adding reliability and security to the application process.
Concurrent with this process, Nyagatare and Benjamin will continue collaborations with clients and expand their relationships to include new relationships to rely on as v1 is finalized and needs testing in real-world situations.
 
Public Launch Date (Version 1, Secure Grant Application Platform): Apr 30, 2022
 
Goal 4 (Fund8 & 9): (May 1 - Oct 27, 2022)
Budget Fund8 & Fund9 (combined): $50,000
$1000 per/mo for 6 months each = $12.
$38,000 is the figure we were given to higher a contracted development team to build the first
Definition of Success: Over the next 6 months, the software platform is added to, bringing it all the way to its final form: a platform that offers solutions for the entire grant process, again, typically 1-5 years. To go through the proposal process for Fund9. 
Details:
As learning is coming in from users of v1, v2 of the software will be in development. This advancement of the software platform will cover solutions for the complete grant process: from application to fulfillment, complete with an entire suite that covers each need of the whole Grant Management period (often 1-5 years per Grantee). It will include various solutions for tracking expenses, remaining funds, goal advancement, and other parameters outlined within a specific grant.
 
Public Launch Date in 12 mo. (Version 2, Application & Full Grants Management Suite): Oct 27, 2022
 
Team Profiles:
Nyagatare Valens, MBA, has worked within the USA government financial management systems, working on grants management for 12 years.
Benjamin Hartin is a ghostwriter in the autobiography genre. His resume includes writing short bios, press releases for high-profile individuals, and full-length manuscripts. A Business Owner for over 21 years, Benjamin finds joy in the process of consultation and iteration when building solutions-based businesses.
Budgetary Details:
Total cost (spanning Fund6, Fund7, Fund8, & Fund9) will be $100,000. 
This covers $1000 per month of our two team members and an estimated $75,000 total cost for software development and functional programming.

INTRODUCTION
Although Decentralized Identity is a novel technology, it has been around for years and, fortunately, many communities agreed that standardization and interoperability is the path to go. W3C DID Working Group and DIF foundation are making great efforts in that direction and hence many solutions with real use cases were developed with those concepts in mind.
For Atala PRISM and Cardano to success in mass-adoption as a DID solution, it's necessary that it can be integrated with existing frameworks that are currently used in real DID solutions. Two examples of that are Hyperledger Aries framework as used by Sovrin Foundation, and DIF Sidetree as used for ION in Bitcoin blockchain.
We believe that if Cardano plugins are available for most common frameworks, providers and developers of DID solutions will start considering Cardano ledger as a valid and excellent option. In other words, being ""ready to use"" plus the advantages of Cardano over other blockchain will boost adoption in the near and long term.
 
PROJECT DETAILS
In concrete, our proposal consists in facilitating the foundational building blocks as a reference to the broad DID community so they can adapt their solutions to work with Cardano with minimum effort.
We divided this work in two parts:

Part 1: Standardization and documentation
Part 2: Cardano plugins development

 
PART 1: STANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION:
The purpose of this initial phase is to normalize and document how Decentralized Identity can be used in Cardano so anyone interested could clearly understand how can be implemented. It should be also designed to be read by people from outside of Cardano community that need to interpret how they can adapt their solutions to Cardano Blockchain. Document style will be similar as the one used in Cardano Developer Portal with a hope that can be included there.
If Atala PRISM implementation code is opensourced in time, we will leverage that information and develop a guide explaining how DID are stored and retrieved from Cardano blockchain.
If Atala PRISM code is not opensourced in time, we will develop a guide explaining several options on how to store and retrieve DID from Cardano blockchain.
The scope of the document will include, but not limited to, the following topics:

DID syntax conventions (i.e. did:ada:mainnet:{identifier})
How DIDs should be stored, retrieved, updated, and deactivated
Where DID Documents should be stored
DID Document conformance (i.e. W3C Decentralized Identifiers v1.0, DIDComm messaging)
Links to useful tools, guides and examples

Deliverable: github or webpage with hosted document
Estimated duration: 2 weeks
 
PART 2: CARDANO PLUGINS DEVELOPMENT
The goal of this phase is to get involved with existing solutions in the DID ecosystems and contribute to integrate them into Cardano blockchain. Those activities are the main driver to get worldwide mass adoption as they will facilitate the broad community outside Cardano to include our ledger in their solutions.
We called those integrations as plugins, not necessarily in the strict sense, but to be seen as essential piece of software or module that can be easily included in existing frameworks. By that means, the framework will adopt Cardano as the ledger part of the solution.
Obviously, the scope of building plugins in general is as broad as we can imagine, so hence, for the purpose of this proposal we will just focus in three cases, leaving other cases to next funding rounds and the community.
Specifically, we will develop plugins for:

DIF Universal Resolver (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver)
Hyperledger Aries from Linux Foundation (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries)
DIF Sidetree reference implementation (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree)

 
The first one is the development of a driver following DIF Universal Resolver specifications that will allow to resolve DID stored in Cardano blockchain.
Deliverable: github with open-source code
Estimated duration: 2 weeks
 
The second one corresponds to the development of code needed to adapt Hyperledger Aries framework to interact with Cardano ledger. We will focus on Aries Cloudagent Python (aca-py) and Aries Framework Javascript. We will provide functional sample code that the community would clone, build and execute.
Deliverable: github with open-source code
Estimated duration: 1 month
 
For the last one, we'll develop a Cardano Plugin and instaniated version of Sidetree reference implementation that communicate with Cardano desentralized ledger, in a similar way that ION did it for Bitcoin. The code will also include a README.md that explain how to compile and execute in a real environment.
Deliverable: github with open-source code
Estimated duration: 1 month
 
BUDGET BREAKDOWN

STANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION: USD 3.500
UNIVERSAL RESOLVER DRIVER:                      USD 3.500
HYPERLEDGER ARIES PLUGIN:                        USD 15.000
DIF SIDETREE PLUGIN:                                     USD 15.000

TOTAL: USD 37.000
 
PROJECT SCHEDULE

STANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION: 2 weeks
UNIVERSAL RESOLVER DRIVER: 2 weeks
HYPERLEDGER ARIES PLUGIN: 1 month
DIF SIDETREE PLUGIN: 1 month

TOTAL DURATION: 3 MONTHS
PROJECT ORGANIZATION
The project implementation will follow Agile management based on Jira Cloud tools. Jira users can be created for follow up and auditability. Additionally, a bi-weekly report will be publish with project progress, mayor milestones and risk assessment.
There are four deliverables that constitute the main metric of progress and success:

Part 1 Documentation
Part 2a Universal Resolver driver
Part 2b Hyperledger Aries plugin
Part 2c DIF Sidetree plugin

As a commitment to the transparency of the allocated funds, we expect payments based on above deliverables without the need of advance payments.
 
THE TEAM
This proposal was elaborated by Rodolfo Miranda. His Linkedin profile can be find at https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolfomiranda/
His background includes a MS EE degree at Stanford University and more than 25 years of successful work experience in both large multinational companies and owned startup projects. His main activities involve architecting, developing, and implementing large scale software solutions for the Telecommunication Industry. He leads multi-disciplinary and multinational teams in the Caribbean and Latin America.
More than 40 years of self-taught programming with advance knowledge on many coding languages. Lately, he was engaged in blockchain technologies with emphasis in Cardano blockchain.
For this personal project he will allocate sufficient time resources to cope with the project. An additional developer will be included to the project to help developing in the existing DID frameworks. The final selection of the developer will be made among already known developers from Latin America that were part of other projects. Note that the developer does not require a full understanding of Cardano blockchain, but a great knowledge of Javascript and Python languages and ability to understand specifications and protocols.
 
ADITIONAL IMPORTANT NOTE
We understand that when ATALA PRISM is delivered it might include additional code or SDK that overlap with some of the deliverables planned in this proposal. In that case we won't copy and use that code as part of our deliverables. Instead, that part of that project can be disregarded. We've broken down the budget and timeframes so each individual part of the project can be eliminated from payments and total duration.

WHY ATALA PRIMS CHALLENGE CHOICE: in our opinion the choice of the challenge was defined on ATALA Prism framework because digital identity is an enabling factor of the platform. Furthermore, all the features of the new Dapp are enabled by the Cardano ecosystem.
DAPP: in our vision MySmartWill will be a platform/dapp that will allow the user to register their will (of any nature) with extreme simplicity and in total safety.
MySmartWill will be an OpenSource platform, that use a large Cardano software ecosystem (blockchain, smart contract, native token, ATALA Prism), and it will therefore be possible for all the players in the Cardano community to support us in improving and expanding functionalities.
Integration with ATAL PRISM distribuited digital identity is a fundamental layer for any users to interact with MySmartWill DApp.
The MySmartWill project implementation consists of two phases:
- Pilot Phase (this Funding Request): the application consists of basic features that allow the user to register and certify their will on NFT and transfer them to the beneficiary upon the occurrence of a simple identification event (e.g. beneficiary's birthday)
- Target phase (not in scope): the application consists of additional features that complete the application with integration with other external platforms (eg. Certification Entities)
MYSMARTWILL PILOT (Funding Request):
In the pilot application, MySmartWill will allow the user to register a will that will subsequently be transformed into an NFT and which, upon the occurrence of a case, will be transferred to the beneficiary. The cases that can be managed in the Pilot project are:
- User's birthday
- Birthday of the beneficiary
- Specific day, month and year (eg. Christmas).
The application pilot consists of the following features:
- Integration with ATALA Prism for user and beneficiary registration
- Registration of one's will through a specific Form and / or upload a pdf document which will subsequently be transformed into NFT
- Definition of a single event identification rule for which verification and / or certification is not necessary (e.g. age of the beneficiary)
- ""Pause"" and ""Restart"" of the Testament
For this first phase, we imagine the following use case:
- The user downloads the MySmartWill application
- The user registers with MySmartWill and carries out the recognition through digital identity (ATALA Prism). A wallet on Cardano is connected to the verified account
- The user selects the event (eg the beneficiary's age) on the MySmartWill platform which is the trigger
- The user registers their will by defining the rules to be applied in case of event verification (NFT transfer). The user fills out the dedicated form indicating their wishes and / or uploads the pdf.
The content of the will is dated (through a specific timestamp) certified and securitized, becoming an NFT (private and not visible to the ecosystem). The platform will automatically generate keys which will then be associated with the beneficiary. Private NFTs will be encrypted with asymmetric keys (eg. with ED25519 signing) and stored in IPFS data storage, so only beneficiary can decrypt the information of NFTs.
- The user registers the beneficiaries by entering all the information useful to identify them (eg name, surname, tax code) and the email for subsequent contact.
- The beneficiary will receive an email notification from MySmartWill and which will be used for registration on the platform and subsequent creation of the ATALA Prism user. At this point the keys generated by the blockchain will be associated
- Possibility to put the will on ""Pause"" and / or ""Restart""
- Upon the occurrence of the event (previously selected by the user), the process of transferring the NFTs / ADAs to the beneficiaries will be started
MYSMARTWILL TARGET (not in scope)
In our Target scenario, MySmartWill will consist of further features that will make the platform complete and open to more fields of application (eg last will, living will, …). Among the additional features (compared to the pilot project) are:
- Registration of the will via Video and Audio
- Chance to modify and delete the will at any time
- Integration with external certification bodies (eg oracles)
The use case Target could be the following:
- The user downloads the MySmartWill application
- The user registers with MySmartWill and carries out the recognition through digital identity (eg Atala Prism). A wallet on Cardano is connected to the verified account
- The user selects the event (e.g. death, injury) on the MySmartWill platform and which will be the trigger
- The user records their will by defining the rules to be applied in the event of an event occurring. The methods of registering one's wishes can be registered through the specific functions of MySmartWill, which are:
• Video recording
• Audio recording
• Upload testamentary pdf file
• Compilation of the dedicated form
The content of the will will be dated (through a specific timestamp) certified and securitized, becoming an NFT (private and not visible to the ecosystem)
- The NFT will subsequently be certified by other users of the Cardato ecosystem (so-called witnesses)
- The user registers the beneficiaries by entering all the information useful to identify them (eg name, surname, tax code) and the email for subsequent contact.
- The beneficiary will receive an email notification from MySmartWill and which will be used for registration on the platform and subsequent creation of the ATALA Prism user.
- Chance to modify, Pause, Restart or ""Delete"" the will
- Upon the occurrence of the event (previously selected by the user), the beneficiaries will receive a notification (e.g. email, text message, ...)
- The beneficiaries receive the NFT containing the will previously defined by the user
CUSTOMER TARGET:
The MySmartWill pilot project is dedicated to a Retail customers and that is why we intend to keep it an Open Source application. We image that MySmartWill could be used by all those people who intend to transfer a thought, a digital intellectual work (e.g. painting, audio, project, ...) to third parties (eg. Sons, parents, …).
Subsequently, with the other features, MySmartWill could be used to define a last will, living will and other ""contract"". In this case it could be used by job categories (eg. Notaries, lawyers, ...) and financial institutions (eg. Banks).
DAPP LAUNCH:
We think that the MySmartWill pilot will involve a large number of enthusiastic community users that will try the features and contribute to increase the number of smart contract transaction in Cardano blockchain.
In our vision after an initial lauch there will be a communication campaign to involve other potential customer (eg. Banks, Insurance, Lawyers…)
BUDGET (MYSMARTWILL PILOT)
We plan to develop and integrate Cardano blockchain technology, ATALA Prism framework that Is available and the future Plutus framework.
In our vision the budget requested could be defined in:
- marketing and communication campaign, contractual deep dive : 5k$
- Design the application functionalities and processes and the use cases: 10k$
- develop, test and deploy the first release (pilot): 45k$
- community rewards to try, test and finalize and adopt the first releases (pilot): 5k$

Please read my gitbook about the CUBI program: https://ancientkraken.gitbook.io/cardano-universal-basic-income/
 
CUBI is the Cardano Universal Basic Income program. Users of the CUBI system will be paid with the return on investment from the delegation of ADA from dedicated stake pools operated by the CUBI program or private investors. The currency given out will be placed into smart contracts that operate as the user's wallet, allowing the purchasing of goods from participating CUBI merchants.
 
The CUBI program is specifically designed to help those in financial need by providing a cryptographically secure method to purchase goods. A by-product of the UBI system is the increase in cryptocurrency adoption at the merchant level and the creation of a donation system where the wealthy can help without the financial loss of their initially donated funds.
 
Each user in the CUBI program will be issued a digital identity, a DID, that is connected to a smart contract wallet and the blockchain. This allows for unfraudulent use of the CUBI wallets and provides an economic identity to those without one. This does force the CUBI user to have some form of smartphone and/or a debit card that must be kept safe and secure.
 
The smart contract wallets will behave like prepaid debit cards. Periodically, each wallet will be replenished up to some maximal amount of ADA. This will allow the user to purchase food, pay bills, and pay rent. The CUBI user can not horde the ADA for personal wealth. After the end of each period, the remaining ADA is returned to the pool. This creates the incentive to use the ADA within that time period to buy goods. This also allows unused or lost wallets to be automatically be regained into the stake pools, ensuring individuals will be able to utilize the system and not abuse it for others.
 
Merchants play a major role in the CUBI program. Similar to the EBT system in the US, participating stores will be able to sell specific products for users with CUBI wallets. The merchants will also be provided with a DID to ensure that each merchant is qualified and a good actor.
A merchant will have a CUBI wallet where each item the merchant sells is represented as a non-fungible token, an NFT. When a CUBI user purchases an item from a CUBI merchant, the NFT will be burned, removing the item from the merchant's wallet and replacing it with ADA from the user's wallet. The transaction on the blockchain is a receipt for the transfer of ADA for goods.
 
CUBI users gain the ability to purchase goods with ADA and the merchants gain the ability to manage their inventory and funds from a single device. CUBI serves as the medium for purchasing power and digital identity while creating a financial ecosystem for everyone to use.
 
 
This proposal will focus on creating smart contracts for the CUBI wallet and DID integration using Atala Prism. The users will need a smart contract wallet and DID that allows for purchasing of NFTs from other merchant-style CUBI wallets.
 
I want to create smart contracts such that this program could in theory be implemented into any city or state. The smart contracts themselves are fairly simple but will require Atala Prism to be fully functional. I want to have the smart contracts done by the end of 2021. With working smart contracts, this idea could be proposed to local governments for an experimental solution for the unhoused peoples of America in the next six to twelve months.
 
I am asking for 5000 USD to provide myself with rent, food, and bills such that I can continue to develop in the Cardano ecosystem.

Market: 

There are more than 20,000 universities in the world. We would like to MVP in Malaysia and replicate success worldwide.
The solution is scalable to upskilling or online learning platforms, which are becoming increasingly popular and more than 100 providers available globally.

Opportunities:
Three major touchpoints are involved in the process of education verification in the context of background checks

An Educational Institution that produces digital certificates and
an Employer/Company (HR) that requests consent for validation,
as well as a mobile phone (students and fresh graduates) that tracks and provides consent.

and this enables us:

To provide a digital verification process to Education Institutions, Companies, and Students/Fresh Graduates using DID and Cardano blockchain.
To build a web-based app or product as an API that can be integrated with an existing system that Education Institutions and Companies (HR) currently use.
To build a mobile/web app that allows end users (students, graduates etc.) to manage their DIDs/credentials

What makes this unique: 
Enabling universities or colleges to produce digital degree or diploma that is immutable and easily shareable for verification. Employers could easily perform education verification without the need of third party, hence making it cost saving.
What we have learned so far:

The process of performing background checks is time-consuming and costly especially when employers are considering candidates but have not yet hired them.
A local solution called eScroll has already been implemented. As we learned, this solution only provides 'hash certificates' to students, which the future employer has to enter on the college/university website in order to verify. DID is not used as a solution.
Data privacy has always been a concern for people. The current hiring process is a hassle where the information(usually in hard copies) has to be shared even before the job interview takes place, and they are unable to track what has been shared digitally.
The banking sector requires job candidates to get solicitor's stamps to verify their documents (including education certificates). The candidates need to physically walk into a solicitor's office to receive the services. Other than that, this is a paper-based process.

The challenges:

Applications based on blockchain technology can be complex for some end users, and many simply don't understand why certain features like Seed Phrases matter.
Implementing blockchain technology in our product requires us to adhere to country, industry, or business policies and practices.
Locally, we must adhere to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). PDPA is an act enacted by the Malaysia Government and was established on 15 November 2013 to protect individual personal data and sensitive personal data in a commercial transaction.

Why we need the fund: 
To quickly get the product out for market validation and iterate to fit the needs
What success looks like:
The goal is to build a product that focuses on getting early adopters, so at the early stage we are working iteratively to ensure the product fits business and user needs.

In 3 months: MVP of web and mobile app is out. At least onboard 3 users of local universities/colleges, 5 users of companies/corporates, and 100 users of students/fresh graduates.
In 6 months: At least onboard 6 users of local universities/colleges, 10 users of companies/corporates, and 300 users of students/fresh graduates. The product is stable and performs well on major touchpoints.

Note: It's assumed the reader is already familiar with Atala Prism (https://atalaprism.io)
""It is about signalling to the world that the Cardano community plans mass-adoption of DID ...""
Most associate Microsoft as being a centralized software provider, however, they have also signalled for some time their commitment to DIDs.
Unthinkable and unpalatable for many readers, but is it not pragmatic to build a working relationship? DID can potentially be a bridge between Atala Prism (Cardano) and the MS ecosystem...ie. millions of users.

Microsoft's mission statement is ""to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."" 
A stated by Charles Hoskinson on Twitter, Aug 2, 2020 ""Cardano is an open platform that seeks to provide economic identity to the billions who lack it by providing decentralized applications to manage identity, value and governance""
It's clear from above that both entities' values and goals are aligned, at least on paper. My plan is to propose a working relationship that is mutually beneficial to both entities but most importantly beneficial to the end users in developing countries.
Charles Hoskinson recently opined in his ""Saturday Night Thoughts"" that ""the biggest challenge for Cardano is not technological, that's easy. It's just getting a bunch of smart people to sit down and do things the right way and get them disciplined and funded and motivated enough to keep doing it until it gets done"".
What does success look like?

Identity is one piece of the puzzle, another one to create trust is the verifiable certification of credentials. As SDKs of Atala PRISM are not yet public and various programs have different degrees and certificates, this part will be handled by an NFT and not through PRISM.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Deliverables and Definition of Success
Deliverables would be sufficient to provide an MVP for universal skills authentication using Atala PRISM:

skills framework: flexible data structure for describing individual skills in a graph-based format (use of a graph allows connections between skills), which can be stored on any platform off-chain (usual approach) or on-chain (a 'personal skills graph') -- this would be based on existing LearnerShape approaches to skills (see below)
individual authentication: protocol and REST API for self-sovereign authentication of a personal skills graph to an individual, using Atala PRISM -- this would aim to be a simple specification (to be enhanced later) drawing upon and ideally compatible with existing work on authentication of credentials (notably the W3C Credentials Community Group (CCG) specifications: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/community/work_items.html#completed-specifications))
skills authentication: protocol and REST API for a third party (e.g. a university, course provider, examination institute or another individual) to certify that an individual has a skill on their personal skills graph, using Atala PRISM -- like #2 this would aim to draw on existing work like that of W3C CCG
application for skills entry, certification and verification: simple web application for accessing the above, including (a) building and certifying a personal skills graph, (b) third-party certification of a skill in the graph and (c) viewing / confirming a personal skills graph.

Together these components would allow an individual to create and share an authenticated personal skills graph, with any number of those skills certified by one or more third parties. Authentication of skills to an individual using DID based on Atala PRISM (#2 above) would allow third parties to provide certifications (#3 above) with confidence that they are certifying the right person (and that such credentials could not be improperly reused).
We would implement these deliverables primarily in Python with a PostgreSQL database and access via a REST API, like the rest of the LearnerShape open source infrastructure (see below). For integration with Atala PRISM and other Cardano infrastructure, we have agreed to partner with Gimbalabs (see Team section below). The specific requirements for such integration are not yet clear, because the Atala PRISM API and SDK have not yet been released.
We would define success in this project as:
3 months

fully-articulated development plan for all deliverables
substantial progress on coding of deliverables

6 months

completion of deliverables and public launch, with code available as open source on LearnerShape Github repository (and within Cardano infrastructure as appropriate)
plan for go-to-market through PeopleCert, Project Catalyst teams and other partners (see Go-To-Market Plan section below)

12 months

working on further roadmap to roll out universal skills authentication in partnership with Project Catalyst / IOHK / IOG, PeopleCert and other partners.

Because the Atala PRISM API and SDK have not yet been publicly released, this proposal is for a proof-of-concept implementation that would be further developed as Atala PRISM advances. We would hope to better understand the technical details of Atala PRISM in the course of this project (ideally obtaining details of the API and SDK), though interactions with Project Catalyst and broader IOHK/IOG teams, to advance integration with Atala PRISM as far as possible at this stage.
Future development beyond this project could include (among others):

fully functional web and mobile apps to access the skills authentication protocol
allow certifying bodies to revoke a certification
allow individuals to present only a subset of their personal skills graph
integrate LearnerShape machine learning functionality for skills comparison into the skills graph
consider incentivizing use of the skills authentication protocol with ADA and/or a bespoke token
integrate (and support interoperability) with other authentication technologies (e.g. new 'personal ID' feature to be added to iOS 15).

Skills Authentication and Potential for Driving DID Mass-Scale Adoption
The accurate communication of skills is a difficult challenge. Whether the skills taught by a university course or the skills of a job applicant, verification is often incomplete, laborious and susceptible to significant errors or outright fraud.
There are various ways that skills can be learned and confirmed, e.g. (a) diplomas and certificates from universities and other educational institutions, (b) certificates from professional bodies, certification organizations and examination institutes, (c) references from colleagues, mentors or supervisors, and (d) evidence or demonstration from the individual with the skill.
Modernizing skill certification with Atala PRISM would create a universal system in which

any individual can claim a skill or qualification
another entity, such as a university, can certify they have that skill
the certification can be verified by another entity, such as a prospective employer.

The universality of such a system relies on a common framework for skills. There is extensive prior development of skill frameworks, including options for the entire economy (e.g. O*NET and ESCO) and specialized options for specific industries and fields. However, the lack of any generally-accepted skills framework and the periodic announcement of new frameworks produces significant confusion. LearnerShape has addressed this challenge by using AI to enable organizations to work with any skills framework (see https://www.learnershape.com/blog/going-beyond-skills-taxonomies-with-AI). LearnerShape's approach allows a skills certification in one framework to be compared with a skills certification in any other framework, allowing the overall system to be universally applied.
The potential for Atala PRISM and DID generally to address the legitimacy of skills and credentials is already being explored, including through the Ethiopia project (which is a major inspiration for this proposal) as well as other proposals in response to this challenge (we are cooperating with some of these – see Team section below). Expanding authentication using Atala PRISM to the huge market for individual and workforce skills would provide a powerful driver to mass-scale adoption of Atala PRISM. By 2025, the global education market is expected to reach ~$7.3T including ~$404B for educational technology (https://www.holoniq.com/notes/global-education-technology-market-to-reach-404b-by-2025/), and digital skills management will be a key enabler of this ongoing growth.
LearnerShape and Open Source Learning Infrastructure
LearnerShape (https://www.learnershape.com/) is building the world's first AI-driven, open source learning infrastructure – a set of microservices for delivering any education application. Our open source components are in the lsgraph repository (https://github.com/LearnerShape/lsgraph), and an explanation of our services is in our e-book (https://mailchi.mp/learnershape/ebook-april-2021-flexible-ai-based-open-source-learning-infrastructure).
A key challenge in recommending a future career or the best learning resources is understanding the current skills of the individual. An area of focus for LearnerShape has been how to work with the different concepts, terms and skills frameworks, taxonomies and graphs currently in use. Adding skills certification and authentication is a key piece of this process, and we hope to work with Cardano Catalyst and Atala PRISM to do so. Our previous work on flexible skills frameworks (see e.g. https://www.learnershape.com/blog)) will give us a major head start on the proposed project.
We provide a YouTube link below to a LearnTech Meetup event at which Maury Shenk speaks about LearnerShape's approach to skills at 33:40 to 41:04.
Team
Our key team members are:
Maury Shenk (proposer, https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauryshenk/)) is CEO and co-founder of LearnerShape, director at PeopleCert (a global testing and certification company) and experienced technology lawyer. He has worked on digital authentication issues for more than 25 years. He would lead the proposed project.
Jonathan Street (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanstreet/) as Head of Data Science at LearnerShape has been applying advanced machine learning models to understand the relationships between skills. He would lead technical implementation of the proposed project.
Sean Miller (https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmiller1066/) is an experienced full-stack developer who plays a key role in delivering LearnerShape applications. He would assist with interface elements of the proposed project.
Lorenzo Zorzi (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzo-m-zorzi-chiarioni/) is an advisor to LearnerShape with strong entrepreneurial experience and a background in financial services. He would assist with designing the user proposition for the proposed project.
We have also agreed to cooperate with Gimbalabs for integration with Atala PRISM and the Cardano ecosystem more broadly, including Haskell programming and general experience with the Cardano environment. This cooperation has been agreed through discussions with Randall Harmon (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/pmd/3084778-48088?) and other members of the Gimbalabs team.
Budget and Funding
We propose a budget of USD 48,000. This is primarily for the following development costs:

design of flexible skills framework, including data structures and file formats (deliverable #1) -- USD 10,000
individual authentication protocol based upon Atala PRISM (deliverable #2) -- USD 7500
skills authentication protocol based upon Atala PRISM (deliverable #3) -- USD 7500
web application for accessing the above (deliverable #4) -- USD 18,000.

In addition, we have budgeted USD 5000 for user proposition design and project management. These amounts include our costs of cloud infrastructure (primarily compute and database on Amazon Web Services) and other overhead.
The proposed budget is below the cost for delivering the project on a commercial basis, but we are committed to co-investment of time and resources to work with Cardano on this project.
Later stages of the project could be funded by Project Catalyst or other sources (e.g. PeopleCert, angel/VC investors or grants). LearnerShape is an early-stage company. Our initial development has been funded by Innovate UK (the UK's government innovation agency) and founder/friends equity. We are currently operating on a per-project bootstrap basis, and anticipate raising seed funding once we have sufficient commercial traction.
Go-To-Market Plan
Once a universal skills authentication protocol is developed, we would actively promote its use.
Our key partner for going to market is PeopleCert (https://peoplecert.org/), a global provider of certification services where Maury Shenk is on the board of directors. PeopleCert has been cooperating with LearnerShape since 2019, and has specifically agreed to support LearnerShape in its cooperation with Project Catalyst. PeopleCert has recently substantially strengthened its market position through acquisition of AXELOS, a joint venture between Capita and the UK Cabinet Office (see https://www.capita.com/news/agreement-to-sell-stake-axelos).
There is also a significant opportunity for cooperation between our project and other Project Catalyst projects. During the F6 proposal refinement process, we have already discussed cooperation opportunities with proposers of various related F6 projects including:

Blockademia Verification System (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Blockademia-Verification-System/366827-48088) – dApp for certification of credentials; strong potential synergies with our project as a third-party certifier (see deliverable #3 above)
Optimizing student agency with DIDs (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Optimizing-student-agency-with-DIDs/369878-48088) – certification of student achievements and progress; potential use case for our proposed service
Education verification with DID (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Education-verification-with-DID/368554-48088) – certification of university credentials, starting in Malaysia; potential use case for our proposed service.

The proposers of all of these projects have confirmed initial interest in cooperation. We would pursue these collaborations once our project has advanced towards public launch, and we expect that numerous other cooperation opportunities will arise in the very dynamic Project Catalyst environment.

SUMMARY FOR COMMUNITY ADVISORS:
The ACADEMY Idea: How much of what you learned at school or university do you still remember? How many books have you read and forgotten everything about content, key-messages and interesting quotes? ACADEMY is aiming to become your personal lifelong learning partner, assisting you in the initial learning-process, managing your provable merits, partnering with established players AND helping you to keep the treasure-box with all your skills and knowledge easily accessible and alive. For a quick overview, please find our functional overview graphic on our WEB-landing-page: 
https://www.academy-suite.com/

Impact / Return of Intention: ACADEMY was initially drafted as conventional application-suite. Being aware that digital ID (DID), tokenomics and data privacy are key foundations for building something really new for attracting a large number of private and institutional participants, the proposers have submitted this proposal to Fund 6 and the Atala Prism Challenge Setting. By showing that this foundation works, new users and substantial attention/value can be brought to Cardano (find more details below).
Feasibility and likelihood to succeed: The proposing team combines diversity, a strong background in learning-methods and innovation with senior industry-leadership experience. Our distributed locations in Brussels, São Paolo and Malta help us also with access to key-resources and to important educational institutions and public authorities (find more details below).
Auditability: In spite of the grand vision, the deliverables for Fund 6 are carefully set according to the motto: dream big - start small. Besides creating a usable MVP for first basic functionalities, we want to proof that the Cardano technology-stack is providing us with a rock-solid foundation for realizing DID and future-proof tokenomics. We have defined tangible milestones along this Fund 6 journey. For transparency reasons we are establishing, maintaining and visualizing our Business Model Canvas, Activity Backlog and Kanban-Boards in MIRO. The successful deliveries according to our Fund 6 goals are crucial to qualify for next rounds of professional (also outside Catalyst) funding, which we will definitely need for reaching our ambitious long-term goals (find more details below).

 
THE DETAILS
Our proposal is based on the anticipation that the methods of human learning and role of knowledge will undergo severe changes during the next years and decades. With the emergence of AI and RPA (Robotic Process Automation), a next wave of disruption will free humans from most repetitive tasks. This, on the other hand, will require a radical change of paradigms with respect to continuously acquiring and optimizing our human knowledge. We can see this as a threat or as a huge opportunity for making learning a joyous effort, supported by access to Internet, specific coaching and the availability of a personalized learning & knowledge tools like our ACADEMY Lifelong Learning Suite.
 
Impact & Return of Intention
This proposal addresses a high-potential application suite outside the typical DEFI space. With digital identity as a key building block, ACADEMY suite aims to build a novel approach to personalized learning and proof of merits. This way, we will introduce the benefits of DLT/Blockchain/DID technologies based on CARDANO to a wide public. Even with starting humble and small, the number of potential users of the ACADEMY Suite in its early stages reaches from university students to language learners and more, and presents a solid foundation to build on for a much more far-reaching project.
 
Our Vision - Dream big
ACADEMY is aiming to become a key player in the rapidly growing field of education technology, and add innovative solutions to pressing challenges facing society, integrating emerging technologies like blockchain and DID for real impact. Take a first glance at our ambitions and vision: 
https://www.academy-suite.com/
(see also ACADEMY overview graphics under ATTACHMENT Folder below)
 
What Distinguishes our Proposal
Academy has the objective of being a learning partner for capturing, retrieving, and refreshing personal knowledge. After building this important foundation, guided learning and gamified learning will come as advanced functionality later on our development journey. Academy is ready to hit the ground running. After completing the conception and design phase for Mindcards, we are ready to provide actual functionality within months.
 
What Is MINDCARDS?
Mindmaps + Flashcards = Mindcards.
While the equation is simple, the potential impact is asymmetrically powerful. Whatever you want to learn or memorize, Mindcards provides you with a space to structure your knowledge in a way that is conducive to the formation of your neural network.
 
This Proposal - Start Small
Despite having an ambitious vision, we need to start small and step by step. This proposal focuses on the very basics of the ACADEMY Lifelong Learning Suite. Within Fund 6 we want to achieve the following:

MVP with MINDCARDS, allowing real usage, adding value to first users/subscribers
Defining the very foundational elements of the technical architecture
Leveraging ATALA Prism for creating a digital identity based foundation (users, certificates, merits, etc.)
Further, advancing the overall business model with monetizing / tokenomics strategies
Roadmap as well as mid- and long term scaling and financing concept
Completing the team with adding strong expertise, especially in the DLT/CARDANO/DID environment and partnerships with selected universities and education experts

 
Business Model Canvas
Within this proposal, we are listing some key-facts of our business model based on a business model canvas approach. This represents a snapshot of our phase 1 approach, and will further evolve as the project progresses.
 
Target Customers (for this Basic approach in Fund 6)

Language learners and rehearses
Students and lifelong learners of all kind
Lovers of Mindmaps and Flashcards (MINDCARDS)

 
Value proposition

Simple way of capturing important information – well-structured, easy to retrieve
Excellent method for making the first steps in foreign languages
Clear message: You and your data are NOT the product. Privacy is key.
Digital identity based proof of merits.

 
Revenue Streams

Free entry mode
Early supporter subscription
Personal Subscription
Group subscription 

 
Channels
During our startup phase, we will utilize specific communities, universities and multiplication over personal networks for conveying our message and for signing up first customers. During MVP stage, ACADEMY Suite will be made accessible over attractively designed IOS and Android APP frontends. 
 
Customer Relationships
Our first customers will mainly be early adopters and people supporting our overall vision. Learning from CARDANO CATALYST, we will build a strong link with this group of early enthusiasts. This allows us to gain important insights and feedback for our further development journey. For the general users, we will establish a YouTube communication channel and In-App feedback loops. Our plan is to implement digital identity based proof of merits and loyality-schemes right from the beginning.
 
Key Activities
During the Fund 6 phase, we plan for the following key activities:

Very careful completion of our team (adding outstanding DLT/Blockchain/Tokenomics/DID expertise)
Detailed design of our short-, mid- and longterm business model based on DID and tokenomics
Designing the foundational technical architecture 
Establishing the basic operational infrastructure (GitHub, starting DevSecOps process etc.)
Fine tuning of UX/UI approach
Development of our MVP
Setting up guerilla marketing channels and activities
Setting up basic customer interaction and service infrastructure

 
Key Resources & Key Partners
Our young and diverse team has a strong background in learning-methods and innovation, complemented by senior leadership experience in industry.

We have a working semantic model and lot's of data both from a wide anonymous and identified user base, both from corporate as well as from private users. The PoC / stage 1 deliverable would be to provide a cross-link of the cardano PRISM and Metadata features in order to allow the users to curate their own verified and certified ""Experience Audit Trail"" (including Education, Job References, Skills, Certificates, etc.).
Employers could use this verified set to speed up candidate selection and knowledge workers could use this to gain access to highly specialised and critical jobs, where experience and references will be tracked & verified.
Milestone Overview:

1 Month: Deliver DAPP & Backend Connectivity to relevant sources of CVs (Files, LinkedIn, HR Systems, etc.)
6 Month: Establish verification and certification processes with top 3 Corporates & Universities (Friends & Family)
12 Months: Scale up usage by adopting career / HR Tech multipliers (e.g. Job Portals, eLearning, Talent Development systems)    

 
Budget Usage:

DAPP Development 20-40k USD
Backend Integrations 30-50k USD
Verification & Certification Process: 50-60k USD  

Of course this budget could be spread out across multiple funds if the DAPP & Backend processes were to be funded first and the required workflows for certifications and verification would be delivered in a subsequent fund / step. However I believe that the commercial viability only occurs once potential employers see the reduction in effort and hence cost for their hiring process.
Hence from a commercial model point of view it is critical that users that leverage the DAPP / metadata platform immediately perceive the comfort and the edge of being at the forefront of the war for talent (while not having any financial obligations) and the employers are willing to pay for the overall service because it adds quality while reducing effort and elapsed time during their hiring processes.    
We believe that this service can be cost positive within the first 3-6 months after launch as we have the direct access to both the talents and their employers via the existing reach and (off chain) services that already are live (Job Portals + Talent Management Platform) .

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


MASTER PLAN
I would like to build a platform for local governments to manage their workflows on blockchain. 
I see governments as holding companies that have different line of businesses thus the platform needs to support all kinds of transactions like managing land and zoning, issuing construction permits,  pet licenses, code enforcement, outdoor dining, health permits, cannabis licenses, special events permits, rental agreements, public works just to name a few. 
In addition I would like to build a level to software SDK that allows for all these different transaction types that is standardizing in accessing and retrieving the data. This would allow each county to implement different kind of protocols on each transaction type in accordance with their laws.
While the platform is getting build up I would like to partner up with few local counties in the US to implement it and get some feedback. I personally do not have experience working governments, I have coordinate open source software, had a few small startups but never had to work with the government.
I would also like to build a user facing application that allows third parties to interact with these type of transactions using the above mentioned SDK. 
BENEFITS
People can actually own their data which is ensured by cryptography and not a ""contract"". 
There is less opportunity for government corruptions and malpractices. 
Public data will be more readily available. 
A land registry in the US. 
MARKET THAT WILL BE DISRUPTED
Electronic signature ($70B)
Title insurance ($26B)
Document management ($7B)
POC PROPOSAL:
Build an initial platform that allows for a select number of workflows that are supported both on the government and citizen side.  I see property and land transaction as the first support case. For example: a county can onboard their historical land deeds and start registering new properties with their new internal workflow management system; meanwhile the user can accept and store their land deed on their digital wallet. 
DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:
- Have an architecture of the data model and governance that is going to be applied for different cities, counties and states and how it will be implemented. 
- Have at least 1 county/city/state partnered with to issue at least one type of transaction. 
-Have 1 web app and 1 phone app that allows for the interaction.

• Executive Summary
Our proposal provides an on-ramp for kids to discover the power of blockchain through their first badges, a form of credentials, in DID badge passports that they receive from hands-on STEM education programs such as coding and robotics. W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are being rollout as the blockchain-enabled ""killer app"" — International COVID vaccine passports. In 2019 the annual number of international tourist arrivals is 1.4 billion worldwide.
Cardano is currently lagging behind other leading layer 1 protocols in terms of being integrated into developer SDK tools of DIDs and VCs for a variety of use cases in Government, Border Control (i.e. COVID vaccine passports), Education, Healthcare, Industry licenses, Associations, Insurance (certificate of currency), etc.
We strongly believe that Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technology would have the biggest social impact if it is widely adopted in primary and secondary education. This project is the first small step towards UN SDG 4 - Quality Education. A coming future of prosperity and abundance where knowledge and abilities/skills become transferable assets, much like digital assets.
 
• Background and motivation
The idea started from Leo's personal experience with the struggle of fitting into formal education in Japan. After dropping out at 13 years old due to a lack of challenging courses, he utilized the growing movement of free open-source courses (MOOCs) from universities overseas. However, a disconnect between educational resources and globally recognized certifications meant that he still had to go through several rounds of standardized testing, which was not only expensive, hard to access and time-consuming, but also didn't provide any space to showcase his ability in programming or specialized knowledge from MOOCs.
With these kinds of difficulties arising in a wealthy country, it's not hard to imagine the kinds of challenges and barriers holding back bright, self-motivated kids in developing regions around the world.
 
• Problem Statement
[From a student perspective]
As we move towards a more interconnected and globalized world, students from underrepresented backgrounds are falling behind. As educational entities navigate the digital transformation, their paper certifications become fragile and short-lived.
Primary and secondary school students are exposed to a myriad of extracurricular workshops, excursions, maker fairs, and many more educational experiences during the school years. However, such experiences are rendered futile by the time they have to start university or polytechnic. There's no secure way to document their learning journey, nor a way to bring this agency to the student – strengthening their individual identity.
The Laboratory for the Science of Individuality at the Harvard Graduate School of Education has demonstrated that there is no average student. Students' interests are variable and change over time responding to external influences. A kid's development is extremely nuanced and there should be room for exploration in terms of education pathways.
The future of work will require professionals that understand multiple disciplines and how they relate to each other. And yet, we push our children through a linear progression model with a universal sequence that pays no respect to their individual variability. This average-based model leaves many kids with low self-esteem because they are not good at exams.
What if the youth could own their educational pathway? What if they had the agency to seek their own interests? And what if, by the time they have to decide on what next step to take, they had documentation in their hands that would help them self-guide?

We are working with Ballarat Tech School for a proof-of-concept and pilot program as part of this proposal. Ballarat Tech School is located at 136 Albert St, Ballarat Central, VIC 3350, Australia. There are ten (10) Tech Schools in Victoria State.
 
• The market
Micro-credentials and digital badges have been used for over a decade. Open Badges alone issued 43.3 million badges in 2020. Kids are exposed to badges and credentials at a very young age, and that's one of the first *documents* they gather that represents their identity.
Across STEM programs, excursions, and workshops for K-12 students, there's no standard record keeping. Young students have fragile and short-lived certifications that are not portable.
First and foremost, there's a market gap in regards to a digital repository of granular formal and informal educational experiences. Moreover, the few solutions live in extremely centralized institutions on centralized databases. A kid's identity should belong to them, and the W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) that onboard a user at a young age will become his or her default blockchain for Web3.
The EdTech is growing like never - As of 10 Aug 2021, there are now 30 EdTech Unicorns around the world who have collectively raised over $20B of total funding in the last decade and are now collectively valued at $90B.
University entry requirements are moving towards skill-based admission criteria. More and more universities are considering extracurricular skills and demonstrated interests during their admission process. However, anything ""non-accredited"" during a kid's time in school has no registration whatsoever. By the time they realize they need it - They don't have it.
 
• The product
In order to drive mass adoption, we intend to bring STEM badges and certificates to the Cardano blockchain. K-12 students will open their first passport in order to receive digital badges related to the educational programs they attended (hour of code, excursion to a makerspace, etc.). That's a gateway to explore the Cardano blockchain without financial commitments.
Badges can play a crucial role in the connected learning ecology by acting as a bridge between contexts and making these alternative learning pathways and skills more portable and impactful. Key benefits include but are not limited to:
Capturing and translating the learning across contexts:
- Capturing of the Learning Path
- Achievement Signaling
Encouraging and motivating participation and learning outcomes:
- Motivation
- Supporting Innovation and Flexibility
Formalizing and enhancing existing social aspects of informal and interest-driven learning:
- Identity/Reputation Building
- Community Building/Kinship
Our development roadmap and Go To Market plan provide a clear on-ramp for DID adoption in the education sector, presented via an easy-to-understand use case, instead of the abstract speculative trading image of crypto held by the general public.
 
• Our vision
Every child in the world should have access to affordable and personalized STEM education.
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and VCs enable true digital ownership and control of each student's accomplishments that are immutable, easily verified, and globally recognized.
Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). This project is the first small step towards UN SDG 4 - Quality Education.

DESCRIPTION
Current personal health data lacks precision and the ability to empower the user.
Being able to document personal health data simply and efficiently on a regular basis would dramatically improve the deeper understanding of health issues and prevention capabilities. This information should be owned by the individual in a secure and lasting way, and be usable between services, applications and practitioners.
To solve this major issue we are proposing to build a mobile app using Unreal Engine to create a beautiful, interactive holistic health tool. This app will provide a universal holistic health identity, and will be able to connect with services such as The Dyana project (our holistic health protocol), but also medical analysis (such as microbiote, epigenetic, blood analysis…). It will enable the use of digital currencies to pay for such health related services.
It will be a leap into the future, with interactive crystalline human that can be used to portray the interrelationship between our mind and body.
Connection with Wolfram Alpha will provide in-depth data on organs and diseases, helping to develop a deeper inner understanding and shifting attention towards the body's ""small signals"", ultimately driving the industry towards more prevention.
Integration with SingularityNet will expand even more the possibilities.
Health is a crucial part of our identity, as it involves our own living being. By using this DID we will drive a global change towards a more inclusive health system, in which our complexity can be explored and visualized in a precise way, enabling more global approaches and knowledge.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


""From data abuse to personal data control and direct compensation"" – implementing and developing on top of the Cardano blockchain a (personal) data management and data sharing platform with integrated DID (ATALA PRISM) that (i) gives people back control over their personal information by choosing who has access to the data and (2) compensates them for the use of their data and for their attention.
Before going into our detailed proposal, we included a short summary on the (i) team, (ii) the cardano adoption in the next 3/6 months; (iii) a summary of our existing product in which we will insert the POC under this fund, and (iv) what 3-6-12 months success looks like.
Team – We have a versatile team with experience in blockchain projects that is able and committed to tackle this challenge within the budget proposed.

Cardano adoption in the next 3 - 6 months - We are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 20.000 expected by Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6
Introduction to Profila and the Profila App
Profila GmbH is a Swiss company founded in 2018 with the main focus to give people control over their personal data and (re)connect brands with individuals in a privacy preserving manner, one-to-one and at scale. Profila has a vision of giving people agency over their online lives, and giving brands a better way to build meaningful customer relationships.
The major functionalities available in the Profila platform (mobile app for consumers and web portal for brands): 
1. Privacy education and privacy rights management – people can learn about privacy and their legal rights, and exercise them towards brands via an easy 3-click process (see our funded proposal in fund 5 – ""control your data; privacy ledger"", https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088))
2. Ethical and consented data sharing - Individuals can select to share certain information to with a brand of their choosing and get compensated for it. (see our proposal in fund 6 – ""dapp to control/monetize your data"" - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/366908-48088))
We already have a finished mobile application (2 years in development) to integrate this Fund 6 proof of concept in and are currently launching the existing Profila mobile application (iOS/Android) with 5 SME consumer brands in 3 regions (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California), and are expecting +/- 1000-2000 users per month to join (via B2B2C model, as invited by brands). 25.000 expected by end 2021; 78.200 expected by end Q2 2022 (approx.. 6 months after the voting ends for this fund 6).
Success after 3 – 6 – 12 months. Counting from the end of the voting results (October/November 2021), success after 3 months would be to have a succesful integration of PRISM DID into the Profila app as our identity management system component. Success after 6 months would be to test with new customers that join Profila. Success after 12 months would be a full fledged deployment of ATALA PRISM, used by each profila user.
 
Now let's move on to our actual detailed proposal (!):
 
1. The Profila Platform today
With Profila, People can manage their digital life in one location via an app that shows which organisations have access to (certain parts of) their personal data. People can sort all their personal information, product preferences and communication preferences and communicate with all the organizations they want to interact with in the same easy way (instead of on each individual organization's platform each time). The entire tool is design for people to (1) gain control over their personal data; (2) choose to ethically share (or not) they personal data with organisations, and (3) get compensated if they do. (see ""Illustration 1).
The Profila platform encompasses two major parts, a mobile app and a web app.
The mobile app allows the user to interact with remaining parts of the Profila platform. It will be used to set up user preferences, consent configuration, subscriptions to brands, etc. In addition, it will provide to the user access to all the information about all activities associated with Profila platform including which ads they have received, which ads they have interacted with, and videos or photos sent to subscribed brands.
The Mobile App: A person centric, multi brand experience mobile application that will enabling an individual to:
- Engage with brands and manage own privacy
- Create and selectively share own digital profile
- Get rewarded in cash and brand value
The Web App: A permission-based relationship for brands with individual customer that will enable to:
- Access evergreen, accurate zero-party data and insights
- Communicate and advertise on a private channel
- Earn attention and deliver true personalization
3. Profila tomorrow – the Catalyst project - integrating with IOG through ATALA PRISM for our identity management system component
Because of all these interactions in Profila between people and brands have legal consequences (including the payout to consumers for granting access to their data), we need certainty that the transactions happened between the 2 parties, and that the individual is who he/she says he/she is. We therefore need proof of identity.
Towards the further realization of the Profila platform, Profila is therefore looking to integrate with IOG through ATALA PRISM for the identity management system component. If you want to control your data online and receive (financial) compensation for your data, it is important you can provide proof of your identity. ATALA PRISM is the perfect solution. By integrating ATALA PRISM, we can better guarantee that the correct person is sharing information and is receiving payments.
Profila would integrate its platform with IOG identity management system to enable customers owning DID based digital ID and various credentials which will be the base for their communication with brands. The identity management part is needed to incorporate zero knowledge proof, the aspect of enabling an individual to share her/his own data (psychographic, preference, etc.) and contents to brands with the fact that the brand does not know any more details about the individual except that information is of a living person who is uniquely identified by the Profila platform and is used for targeting and advertising purposes.
We believe that we can use ATALA PRISM for the following capabilities:

Digital ID – one click registration; login; confirmation

        2. Credential management – user owning and sharing credentials
        3. Data privacy management – user exercising legal data subject rights
        4. Document certification (ID documents, legal documents, certifications, KYC, etc)
        5. Data Sharing – user selectively sharing information
        6. Personal Data Vault – user controlling third party access
 
The following use cases are foreseen:

User registration - As Profila, we need to register any Profila user with digital ID or Physical ID to ensure that he/she is a living person.

2. User identification - As Profila, we need to ensure that all users are cryptographically identified as a unique person so  that no two users with the same identity can register in Profila Platform.
3. User's data sharing (anonymously – OPTION 1) – as a user, I need to be able to choose to disclose only some parts of my profile anonymously to a brand of my choice, and securely share information.
4. User's data sharing (consented, via data subscription – OPTION 2) – as a user, I need to have an option to take my consent for sharing the whole of my profile non-anonymously to a specific brand.
5. Brand advertising - As a brand admin, I need to create a private and secured connection with individual for advertising
***
What other challenges are ahead in our ""Zero-knowledge advertising & insights"" development roadmap?
This ATALA PRISM DID project is only one of the steps into our broader Cardano technology adoption and integration around zero-knowledge advertising and insights, which all relate to the control of your personal data and your attention by you as an individual. 
Under the other funds and challenges, we already have submitted additional project proposals for important other features we want to develop as part of this effort:
- step 1 - personal data license smart contract – under this step, individuals can select to share certain information to with a brand of their choosing and get compensated for it. (see our proposal in fund 6 – ""dapp to control/monetize your data"" - https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Dapp-to-control-monetize-your-data/366908-48088))
- step 2 - privacy ledger – This will include a ledger for all privacy interactions via the privacy rights management platform, which allows users to control their data via legal privacy rights (e.g. right to be forgotten or the right to rectify incorrect data). UPDATE - We have submitted this proposal under the ""metadata challenge"" of FUND 5 and received the first place! #thankyouADAcommunity. See here for our proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Control-your-data-%E2%80%93-privacy-ledger/350680-48088. We will keep you posted on our progress.
- Step 3 - digital ID (for FUND 6) - Atala PRISM implementation – this is the present submission
- step 4 (for FUND 7 or later) - zero-knowledge proofs* - personalized ads with respect of privacy - using zero-knowledge proofs* in order to allow a brand to advertise to the ""perfect"" consumer (meaning to the exact target audience consumer, which exactly matches the specific offering/message a brand wants to share), without sharing ANY personal data with the brand. Stay tuned for more information!   (*Zero knowledge proof is a sort of an approach securing private data, which is through a cryptographic technique that has been used to provide privacy by design in the context of DLT and blockchain. Shortly, zero knowledge proof allows an entity called a prover to argue to another party, called verifier, that a determined statement is true without revealing more information than strictly necessary to convince the truth.)
4. Practical aspects – ""show us the money"" – costs
Via this submission, we are requesting funding to develop our ATALA PRISM DID proof of concept integration. We assess that the creation of such a POC will require at least a budget of 39.650 USD for a 3-month development project, to be allocated as follows:
- 20 days of senior developer (Raja, our CTO) @ 900 USD per day – totaling 18.000 USD
- 25 days of web/backend developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 7.500 USD
- 25 days of app developer @ 300 USD per day – totaling +/- 7.500 USD
- 7 days of legal and project management work, including progress reporting (Michiel, general counsel) @ 950 USD per day – totaling +/- 6.650 USD
5. Practical aspects – ""getting on the road"" – GTM; geographical focus; target customer
At the time of the submission of our application to Catalyst Fund 6, the development of our Profila App is finalized and we are onboarding/setting up 5 small and medium enterprises (SME) to trial with their existing consumers. This section explains more about our GTM, ideal location, target customers etc.
(1) Go-to-Market – our Go-to-Market is B2B2C, namely working with brands to invite their existing consumers onto the Profila App, as a new communication channel that is privacy compliant and consumer centric. As part of the onboarding process of these brands, we work together with them to design a promotional campaign via email/social media, via which they invite their best customers to engage with them via Profila.
We have signed up 5x SMEs in 3 regions (see below), who in total have around 500.000 existing customers all combined. Considering that we expect 5% of this customer base to accept the invitation and join Profila, we foresee 25.000 active Profila users in 2021 (Q1 2022). According to our active brand onboarding efforts, this should grow to 78.000 by the end of 2022 (by adding more brands).
(2) Geographical focus market? We are launching the Profila App with 5 SME Brands in 3 regions in Q3 2021 (Benelux - Switzerland - Orlando/California).
(3) Ideal consumer segment? – privacy-aware and digitally savvy ""Millennials"" (adults between the ages of 22 and 39 years old) that are ware that they have rights to their personal data, but do not yet have an easy tool to control it; and ""brand-loyalists"" (consumers that have an affinity with the brand and would like to have a closer 1-1 relationship).
(4) Ideal SME segment? – SME companies in these 3 regions that respect consumer privacy and want a better relationship with their consumers, with a prime focus on SMEs in the following industries: (1) fashion, (2) travel, (3) leisure/recreation.
(5) Marketing, Website & social media presence – We have focused our 3-year research and development phase (as well as our funding) on the development and testing of our consumer app and brand dashboard and have – on purpose – not made much noise about our project until now. Now that the first product is ready and being tested, we are starting a first marketing campaign on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/profilaprivacy (B2B, attracting new companies that want to have a different relationship as described above), we are rebuilding our Website www.profila.com (new version expected end of 2021), and will start a consumer campaign on social media focusing on our ideal customer target (see above).
6. Intellectual Property information (freedom to operate; IP registrations; contracts)
As an intellectual property lawyer, I made sure that all Profila's intellectual property (IP)-assets are documented/protected:
First, we have conducted a thorough freedom to operate study and patent landscape analysis with the Swiss Innovation Agency, to make sure we are free to develop and commercialize our current technology without infringing on third-party rights.
Second, we have filed for the necessary trademarks that protect our logos and trade names in commerce.
In addition, we have a solid contractual framework in place with all of our suppliers, employees, contractors and customers. All parties involved in our day-to-day activities are doing so under a contract, which include the necessary IP transfer-, confidentiality- and non-compete obligations that protect (and collect) our company's intellectual assets. As part of that, every contracted developer has assigned all IP rights to the Profila App to us, which we will also require from developers working on this project.
Finally, we are looking into open sourcing the majority of the technology (code) developed under this project and will assess (and take feedback) on an ongoing basis which components would be of interest to the community.
7. Defining success
The POC we will develop under this Catalyst fund 6 submission will add important functionalities to our consumer App – which is being tested on the market during the next 6 months. The POC will also advance our mission and vision to provide people with control of their data and compensation for their attention. Success of the POC would be that we can integrate it into our existing App with one of the 5 SME brands that are testing, and make sure it works with their consumers. .

Brief introduction to ISDR/GL
Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural des Grands-Lacs was founded in 2002 and has awarded undergraduate degrees since 2006. Since then, over 8,000 students have graduated from ISDR/GL in 6 departments focusing on rural development.
Website: www.isdrgl.org
Facebook: www.facebook.com/isdrgl
 ----------PAST SUCCESS & IMPACT -----------
ISDR/GL, DID and Cardano

ISDR/GL has offered free hosting of Cardano meetups organized by the West African Decentralized Alliance (WADA) 
ISDR/GL hosting 200 participants for the Cardano Summit 2021 for in-person attendance in Goma, DRC 
Students from ISDR/GL conduct 2 one-month long field stays in rural areas where they interact with rural farmers and support local rural business in organizational skills
Credential verification is costly both for the institute (around 2% spent on emails, calls, trips and documentation) and students ($50 is get degrees signed by the Ministry of Higher Education and a replacement costs over $100)
Schools are among the first providers of identity in Congo and students cards are widely used for authentification.

Implementing a Cardano-based DID for students

Incentivize students to pay a portion of their student fees using the Yoroi wallet for a discount on a first-come first-served basis.
Update the ISDR/GL Website to incorporate online deposits from the Yoroi wallet
Host a third WADA meetup involving more students and facilitate students to buy ADA through the WADA Hub of ISDR/GL.
Host members of the ISDR/GL Alumni Association to promote the DID.
Update student management system (EDUSYS) to incorporate a cardano digital identification (DID)

----------FEASIBILITY -----------
DID in ISDR/GL 

Student IDs have unique identification codes (barcode)
Government issued ID have serialized codes (barcode)
A Yoroi-like wallet would produce a public address (QR Code)
New DID merges the three IDs and can be deconstructed into each
Student Management System updated to incorporate new QR code and YOROI integration
QR Code replaces current Barcode. 
New QR code used for validation at different stages (examination, book rentals, field trips, etc.)
System can validate the tree founding IDs as well (further details below)
These three Institutes collaborate on several initiatives (curriculum, students field trips and student sport championship)

DID beyond ISDR/GL

ISDR/GL has led several ID-related innovations that were copied by other universities and institutes : Switch from laminated IDs to PVC cards in 2009; barcodes and RFID tags in 2015 and Moodle-based distance learning in 2020.
At each occasion, several universities requested support in adopting the new tools
Heads of Higher Education Institutions meet through the Conférence des Chefs d'Établissements and many Director Generals of ISDR/GL have chaired the Conférence.
Network of ISDR/GL Alumni can be a useful ressource in promoting public adoption of DIDs
Network of ISDR/GL 12 rural extension centers (Antennes de Développement Rural, ADR) will promote DID for farmers and rural population when applications are available.

Metrics

Update roster of graduates since 2006 to incorporate new DID. An estimated 2500 keep frequent contact with the Institute
On-board 2021-2020 enrolled students (estimated around 2,000) into new system
Host the Conference of Heads of Higher Education Institutions (Conférence des Chefs d'Établissements) to present on the use case of Blockchain technology and promote the adoption of DID for credential verifications.
Support partner institutions that would like to use blockchain-based DID for credential verification.
Mint Degrees (6 departments/faculties) as NFTs and issue them to participating Alumni members.
Promote the use of DIDs through the media.

 
Roadmap & Costing
Phase 1: First 3 months (Start of 2021-2022 School year on October 15 to January 2022)

Update EDUSYS and Website to process payment in Ada and use new QR Code ($6000)
Mint and issue 2500 NFTs to alumni to certify their degrees ($2500) with priority to those furthering their studies or actively seeking jobs
Interested graduates will cover the fees to send them the NFTs of their diplomas
Campaign to promote the discount of tuition paid using ADA ($2 per student, $4000). An ISDR/GL employee in the computer lab will be answering questions, help students buy ADA and highlight key elements of the new system (ex: importance of safekeeping the passphrase).
Campus Wada Hub will assist classmates acquire Ada on Campus with support from ISDR/GL financial services for exchange.
Cardano wallet will be used to buy goods on campus such as drinks and sports items.

Phase 2: next 4 months (January 2022 to May 2022 - Anticipatory)

Host 2 Cardano meetups open to all students and faculty. Goal is to brainstorm on applications of DID and review the implementation in ISDR/GL ($1,000).
Host Conference on blockchain technology and invite Heads of Institutions (Rectors, Director Generals and Chancellors) from 2 public and 3 private universities. At such occasion, representatives from the office of the governor also attend. Goal is to showcase the applications of the new QR Code and DIDs applications. ($2,000)
Second-year students have field trips from April to May and around 800 students participate. A lead instructor will be assigned to conduct a survey on members from the affiliated micro-lending Cooperative du Kivu (CAKI) to find ID-based obstacles faced by farmers and rural populations. ($1,500)

 
Phase 3: next 2 months (June 2022 to July 2022 - Anticipatory)

Liaise with ATALA Prism to leverage the Cardano Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) to record past graduates from ISDR/GL and prepare the records of the 2021-2022 graduating cohort
Support owners and managers of partner institutions that want to adopt the new Digital ID. Two close partner institutions could adopt the DID and ISDR/GL can delegate ressources to implement the tool ($2,000)
One university in South Kivu, Université Simon Kimbangu of Bukavu (www.facebook.com/uskbukavu), with over 3,000 past graduates and 650 enrolled students, has requested to join the initiative for a blockchain-based DID
On-going discussions with other university managers are encouraging as they also would like to reduce the risk of fraudulent cases among students whole diplomas are sent for signature at the ministry of higher education.

 ----------RISK MANAGEMENT & AUDITABILITY-----------
Risk Management

Atala Prism DID may not be compatible with new ISDR/GL DID: ISDR/GL DID components will be made up of 3  concatenated IDs including a Cardano Public Address, which could be useful in linking up records
Public institutions may be prevented from participating in a blockchain-based solution: highlight incorporation of government ID serial code in new DID
ADA appreciating price may limit distribution of NFTs of degree among members of the Alumni Association : Distribution will be based on a first-come, first-served basis. Distribution may be limite to active members who usually hold meetings on campus. 
Unexpected costs to which ISDR/GL may also contribute ($1,000).

Auditability

ISDR/GL is a public institution which undergoes annual audits by a recognized firm
Management committee will receive the funds to implement the project
Video and other digital products will be produced
Phase 2 & 3 will be dependent on the success of Phase 1
Regular updates by proposer team

Overview
Self sovereign identity will become an important part of the growing amount of decentralized applications being developed on Cardano. For the Project Catalyst community, the use of an identity solution can help with allowing community members to build up a reputation and trust in a way that can be self owned and verified. Atala Prism will offer the building blocks to start creating a digital identity, where people will have ownership of that identity and can verify it to other people and protocols.
The purpose of this proposal is to develop tools and provide examples for some of the foundational blocks of Atala Prisms initial implementation of self sovereign identity (SSI). This includes both decentralized identifiers (DID's) and verifiable credentials (VC's). The proposal will help projects establish themselves as issuers and provide credentials to community members based on a certain condition. The initial verifiable credentials for this proposal will focus on verifying participation and completion within community projects.
This work can be expanded on in future proposals, where we can also look at how trust and reputation networks could be introduced using things such as ADA as trust collateral or endorsements from trusted people for helping with reputation.
This initial proposal addresses the challenge as it aims to provide a simple way for the community to start using the identity solution using Atala Prism. This allows the community to build up their knowledge on its importance and also helps provide open source examples for other developers looking to integrate Atala Prism. Increasing awareness and usage of Atala Prism identity in the community along with helping speed up developers integration of the identity solution by providing examples should help with driving faster adoption of Atala Prism.
 
Example credentials
The following are two examples where you could issue some simple participation or completion credentials. Other projects could use the same source code to achieve a similar outcome!
- Catalyst Swarm Attendance - Issue an attendance credential to people who attend after townhalls or weekend sessions to let people know who is active in the community session.
- Catalyst School Workshop Completion - Issue a completion credential to people who completed a Catalyst School workshop to showcase their new knowledge.
 
Community credential tools
The first and main part of this proposal is providing the tools necessary for a community project to issue credentials to another person that has an Atala Prism identity wallet. These tools will make use of VC's and DID's. The idea behind the code for these tools is that other community projects could copy it and change what they want to about the credentials and use it for their own use case.
 
projectcatalyst.org verify integration
The additional smaller part to this proposal is providing an example of how you could verify an issued credential. The verification step consists of checking a credential against the trusted issuer address and that it is valid. We will integrate a verification process into the projectcatalyst.org site to showcase a simple example of verifying a credential by letting community members add the credential to their profile. This added example will guide other projects integrating Atala Prism on how they could verify credentials in their own application.
 
Development steps
- After the launch of Atala Prism we attend and learn from the associated pioneers program
- Determine appropriate data to add to the participation or completion credentials
- Develop the tools needed to issue and verify credentials for the project team
- Document steps to issue credentials to a given community member
- Integrate the verification of a given credential issued by respective project teams so that they can be added to a projectcatalyst.org community member profile
 
Education workshop
After we've completed development of the tools for issuance and accepting credentials for community projects along with the verifying example on the website we can then look at providing a workshop at a After Town hall to answer questions and support other projects looking to integrate Atala Prism.
 
In the workshop we will showcase the product, reveal how projects can use the credentialing system on the projectcatalyst website and discuss different examples. Depending on the feedback we will iterate and use the input to further develop the product for upcoming funding rounds.
 
Roadmap
In the short term, an accurate delivery time will be difficult to provide for this proposal as the work has the pre-requisite of having Atala Prism available to develop with. It has been mentioned previously this should become available in Q4 of 2021. Once the date is confirmed and the documentation is available, it will become easier to determine more exact dates of delivery. We can provide a roadmap for the development work to be completed where it should likely take anywhere between 5 to 7 weeks to develop after Atala Prism is available followed by at least 4 weeks for onboarding, monitoring and collecting feedback. The completion time could be slightly reduced or extended based on how easy it is to work with Atala Prism in its first iteration after launch - which for the moment is an unknown at the time of finalizing this proposal!
- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community
- 6 months - Monitoring and analysis of results, should finish a completion report in this time frame
- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed
 
Feasibility
- Technology - The PACE team joined the Atala Prism After Townhall and confirmed that the core parts of self sovereign identity (DIDs and VCs) will be functional when Atala Prism is launched. See  This proposal as a result is technically feasible after the launch date of Atala Prism as planned and builds upon some of the core concepts of self sovereign identity.
- Team - George has spent a couple of months already looking at self sovereign identity space in a previous proposal https://servnetwork.org and has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps.
Impact
- Awareness - By helping existing community projects, the execution of this proposal should help to provide increasing awareness to people who join the community and get involved in different ecosystem projects.
- Community adoption - By showcasing the possibilities of participation and completion credentials for community projects the community adoption of Atala Prism will increase.
- Developer adoption - Examples of integrating Atala Prism will help speed up other developers integrating solutions into their own applications and also potentially help other developers generate ideas on how they could also integrate Atala Prism into their own applications.
- Shared learnings - Our experience of creating tools to help the community will provide useful learnings we can share with the community to prevent common pitfalls
 
Auditability
- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.
- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst
- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e
- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7
- The workshop after developing the Atala Prism solution will be recorded and uploaded to Youtube
 
Success metrics
- Number of credentials issued and verified - One metric to assess success will be trying to attract a large number of the community to engage with using the solution to get participation or completion credentials. We can track how many people are issued credentials by community projects and also how many try verifying the credential on the https://projectcatalyst.org website after the first few months of completing the proposal development work.
- Usage of source code & technical discussions - A more qualitative success metric will be helping other projects start using Atala Prism solutions. Technical discussions with teams on implementing Atala Prism based on the experience from this proposal would be highly valuable towards producing more innovative and ambitious solutions.
 
What success looks like
Success of this proposal will be defined by community projects having an easy way to issue credentials that are valued by an increasing amount of members of the community as the tools get adopted. A write up of any conversations with other project teams that benefited from the workshop or discussions about Atala Prism will also help to highlight value brought by the execution of this proposal.
 
Budget
- Atala Prism Pioneer program - No time is included in the budget for the time spent in the Atala Prism pioneer program, this will be out of the teams own personal time.
- Time required: 10 weeks = 40 hours x 10 = 400

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Atala PRISM is an important step towards mass adoption of Cardano. With an accessible DID, many new users will have a chance to discover other services in the Cardano ecosystem. But not everyone will have access to spare Ada to use to pay for transactions or other services.
I've been interested in decentralised identity for almost a decade, though only privately. With Atala and Plutus, Cardano seems to be ready to make this happen. 
While blockchains are usually associated with privacy, there are many applications where having a public identity is beneficial, even crucial (academia, reputation..).
There already are already projects trying to reach mass audiences with this approach, but I think Cardano is uniquely positioned to make it work. 
 
My solutions is to create a simple token, BIT, that is tied to every verified unique Identity on Cardano. Every user can mint this token at the same rate. And once possible, can use this token to pay for supported smart transactions without needing to spend any Ada. This incentivises new users to regularly interact with the platform, and look for new applications that support this token.
This also serves as an incentive for Identity providers to establish a common standard for physical ID, as users will be motivated to register for other services if they simultaneously get registered to receive this virtual income for free.   
Should the token gain any external value from these interactions, it could be a great motivator for unbanked people from low income areas to join the Cardano ecosystem. Accumulating even a few Ada per week can be significant income for many.
 
This is an experiment in market based basic income - the token has no intrinsic value, except the guarantee that it can be minted only by real people at equal rate for everyone. 
 
Success Metrics
3 Months: While Atala's solution is not public yet, I think I can manage to have a working prototype in this timeframe. The full solution will require Babel fees and support from SPOs, but it will be usable by users who don't have issues spending Ada.
We will publish a list of verified people and projects interested in building support for this token.
Also taking part in the ADA MakerSpace hackathon - https://adamaker.space/hackathon2021/basic-income-token/
You can support the creators of the hackathon in Fund6:
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/ADA-MakerSpace-Bounty-Hunters-DEVX/369522-48088
6 Months: We will be reaching out to DID providers in and outside of Cardano with this value proposition. Other projects should start adopting this token.
I've already reached out to Adriano Fiorenza from GameChanger Wallet (https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/GameChanger-The-onboarding-wallet/367709-48088), who would help to integrate these projects.  
I plan to also build a prototype for a ideation platform based around the BIT token, detailed in my other proposal:
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/SOIL-Scalable-Open-Innovation/367740-48088
12 Months: Hopefully by now, public blockchain addresses will be widely recognized and used not just to accelerate onboarding of new users.
 
Budget: $6000
I hope to start developing full time for the Cardano ecosystem, on this and related projects. 
This would cover the costs of living for my family for up to 3 months here in Berlin.
I plan to develop this further in following funds, looking for more interested co-creators to bring real people on the Cardano chain!
 
Launch date:
Blog, detailing progress and challenges: by 1.10.2021
Public presentation with space for each verified person / project: by 11.11.2021
Stake pool / Alliance enabling verified users to participate: hopefully by Christmas :) 
 
I have also attached an earlier draft of this idea and a quick pitch for the ideation platform.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We are utilizing Atala PRISM DID's to log into the platform, grant in-game rights and proof proficiencies via Verified Credentials. The system is designed for users to engage in meaningful collaborations, building worlds and content together. It also provides easy ways to find peers for study and work. In building our own ecosystem, community collaboration and educational materials, we will substantially grow Cardano's and Atala PRISM's user-base, network-utility, network-value & ADA circulation.
Over the last 40 years, there is growing interest in making education more engaging, self-motivated and comprehensive through the use of digital games, often called ""serious games"". This trend breaks with the common understanding of ""game"", ""play"" as a waste of time, opposed to ""work"" and ""study"" for achieving meaningful things in your life through hardship.
Our platform is a low poly 3D-MMO-Sandbox-World, where you can learn and explore a language controlling your avatar. The in-game currency is a native token which fuels the system. We are redistributing all revenue streams of the platform into a treasury via smart contracts, swapping everything to ADA and ensuring an exchange rate of our token to ADA. In doing so, we provide further value and utility to all our students and contributors.
MMO-Games are ideal interactive learning environments, rewarding meaningful participation while being immersed into a subject. They provide a deep and rich context of ambiguous variety by inviting you to explore a narrative world full of wonders. Games promote creative problem-solving and critical thinking. They are clearly structured through space and checkpoints, highlighting your progress and what may lie ahead of you. You have the freedom to choose the direction and progress in your own speed. You are allowed to experiment and fail in a safe, welcoming and guided environment, supporting you to try again and eventually succeed. Finally, games are direct feedback loops, giving you important information and assessing your actions.
Effective learning needs to be fun and contextualized to be memorable!
We are learning best through embodied experience, not by merely reading and hearing about it in a non-related setting. To learn how to use a language, surely you need to listen, but you also need to talk, communicate and make it your own.
We invite you to explore, experiment, collaborate, create and craft to understand!
""The limits of my language means the limits of my world"". Friedrich Wittgenstein, philosopher
""Language is about being able to converse with people, to see beyond cultural boundaries and find a shared humanity"". Timothy Doner, super-polyglot
We firmly believe that language proficiency is one of the most crucial factors to overcome national and cultural limitations, collaborate with one another and push self-determined development.
Therefore, we are focusing on language learning first, with the possibility to scale to every educational field.
We've been thinking about what might be the most-needed languages for the Cardano ecosystem.
We think these are:
English, Arabic, Japanese, Amharic and Oromo, Swahili, Spanish, French, Russian, Mandarin and Hindi.
Why choose these languages as our starting point?

We figured that for achieving more communication across languages, we should start with the most spoken languages, both for L1 and L2 speakers. These account for English, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish, French, Russian and Arabic.
We then thought about recent or old partnerships of Cardano and how to deliver maximum value and possibilities to these early adopters. Japan is the country where a big part of Cardano's history begun, and it has a vibrant economy. The deal with the Ethiopian ministry of education is why we included Amharic and Oromo. In Tanzania, Cardano is building infrastructure with the World Mobile Group, so we added Swahili, which also has a considerable amount of L2-speakers across Africa.
We thought about twelve languages being better than eleven, so we will probably add at least one more language to the base layer. The candidates are Urdu, Indonesian/Malay, Persian, Georgian, and Bengali. Eventually, we want to encourage participation of as many languages as possible, to connect and enable a multitude of people to build and localize in various languages.

 
Each language has their own local community and in-game territory, where only the language is used. In there, you have a city, thriving with other players, NPC's and activities/quests. These cities are community hubs, built and sustained by the local community. These locals are composed of the native and proficient speakers, which can prove so by Verified Credentials.
A vital part of our concept is communication. You can invite other players to talk with you, join guilds, work on jobs and solve team-quests together. With this, the tedious search for a tandem or peer to practice your chosen language is becoming obsolete.
Outside the city, you have the level grounds, where further community-made levels and adventures are organized.
Content, e.g. lessons, quests and levels, is curated by several independent DAOs, one for each topic/language. You gain the right to contribute to a subject and join the corresponding DAO by proving your proficiency via an existing Verified Credential, stored on Atala PRISM (e.g. be a native speaker). The other option is to play through the existing content of that subject, reaching a high level in it and mastering the language on the way. You then become eligible to take a standardized test and earn a Verified Credential, which we issue to your Atala PRISM DID.
To add a new subject/language, you need to gather an initial founding team of dedicated professionals. These are representive for the ground level work of the new subject, so it must be ensured that the team is sufficiently diverse. These will implement and create basic narration, functionalities and standard content for the new subject, building a solid foundation for the community to grow.
 
Blockchain-specific parts:
NFTs are used to represent and identify every item and level in the game. NFTs for items and collectibles can be traded via an integrated NFT marketplace. These include collectibles, mounts, etc..
We will use Plutus Smart Contracts to handle the treasury and exchange rate of our Native token to ADA (Mini-DEX). They also enable users to monetize their services and sell products.
We store levels and areas in transaction metadata by serializing their construction information into JSON.
We are building an intuitive procedural-modeling 3D level editor to create your own ideas, implement various blueprints and best-practices.
We created a distinct proposal for the level editor, which you can find here:
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/3D-Level-editor-for-game-devs/367171-48088
We have a whole set of competitive edges:

We let you feel the importance of learning and collaboration by rewarding every meaningful participation with our own native token. All revenue-streams are redistributed to give this token an exchange-value to ADA, offering an economic incentive for all users and possibly contributing to your basic living costs while learning.
We diversify global standards and access for making business by actively driving utility, visibility and inclusion of less globalized languages and markets.
We are providing effective, research-based learning strategies for both informal and formal teaching for everyone.
We are connecting people to collaborate, study, work and communicate in a social, welcoming environment.

 
Why do we need DID's and how will this drive mass-adoption of Atala PRISM?

Every user needs an Atala PRISM DID to log into the game. If they do not have one, we show them how to get one.
The platform issues Verified Credentials to the user's DID to prove their progress/proficiency in a subject and to grant and assert certain rights inside the platform, based on their Credentials.
We offer every user their own virtual space inside their proficient areas. They can build on top of it, getting visibility for whatever they want - may it be local manufactures, products, services, art or just something nice. In doing so we enhance their reach for making business and connecting with other people.
We serve institution-level customers like universities and schools to buy their own territories and/or issue their own Credentials to their students. This way, they can expand their curriculum into the virtual space, which is possibly easier to access and gives more options.
For companies, we are offering a representative space in a specific, limited ad-area. No company can have ads in more than one territory.
Eventually, we want you to be able to take standardized tests to directly assess your proficiency from inside the platform. These tests meet global standards, like CEFR A1 to B2 for starters, but we also want to connect to other novel standards and drive diversification of proofs.

We plan to scale the platform for VR-usage and eventually all fields of education.
We want to host the platform in a decentralized way! The best solution would be to utilize a provider in the Cardano ecosystem, and if we can find one we will build on their infrastructure. Until then, we are currently looking into solutions like Akash, Filecoin and AWS. This will only matter later on, so it will be decided in the follow up proposal in Fund 7.
We are also designing a non-game interface to access learning material and mechanisms from outside the game, without the need to log in with an avatar. We do this to cater to people not willing to do so. These might still be interested in posting a job, showcasing their profession or learning vocabularies on the next train ride to work. They can still profit by our innovative and dynamic system without leaving their comfort zone.
 
Market:
The serious games market is highly competitive, consistently growing in double-digit %. The global gaming market had a value of around 167 billion dollars in 2020. Games like Roblox or Fortnite, that also offer user-generated content and an own in-game economy and currency, report several hundred million monthly active users. Minecraft is the most-sold video game of all time, with 238 million sold copies.
Product:
We provide one immersive and social platform to eventually all kinds of subjects, topics and professions. You can learn, teach, offer your real-life skills like translating content into different languages, or choose an in-game job that contributes to the platform.
Acquisition:
Access to educational material in an organized, sensible fashion and seamless connectivity to fellow students, peers and professionals will drive the need for our platform. We are prioritizing the development of resources helpful for Cardano's partnerships, e.g. the Ethiopian government deal, providing extra value for these early users.
Monopoly:
By expanding our user base, the platform-ecosystem grows and we also refine our developer resources and team. The more popular we get, the more people partake in shaping the future of the platform, adding subjects and topics, resulting in more levels and content being built by community and institutions alike.
Show us the money:
We are fully aware that we will need a lot of resources for a project on this scale. The core team focuses on the game framework, while local teams are formed for all eleven languages. These will be paid equally in the platform's tokens.
To start the development process, we decided to pay $1200 to each of our seven core team members for the initial six months. This is enough to at least cover basic costs of living. As we acquire more funding and partnerships, we will expand our team and hire more specialists to work for us full-time and outsource tasks. Currently, we have five core team members.
7 members * $20*60h * 4 months = $33600
We will create a follow-up proposal in Fund 7 to continue the development process.

■Establishing a brand for local specialty products
By replacing the Ataraprism's national IDs with cattle IDs and operating them, we can establish a blockchain traceability solution from beef production to the dinner table and promote branding (Japan already has a cattle ID database to manage cattle traceability).
This is a situation that we are promoting in cooperation with the prefectural assembly members. We have already given a presentation on Cardano to more than 10 staff members of related departments in the prefectural government. After that, the prefectural assembly members plan to submit the proposal to the governor.
Once this project gets off the ground, it can be developed into a platform for attracting funds from outside the prefecture and overseas through hometown taxation and funds. The prefectural assembly members are very motivated to move forward with this project, which has led to the following actions and plans.
Visited the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Department of the prefectural government, which has jurisdiction over the livestock industry in the prefecture, and made a presentation. We introduced our cattle traceability solution and also asked about the issues that the government faces. Based on the content of this presentation, we will propose the solution to the Livestock Breeders' Association (business organization), which is the next step, and hold a hearing. After that, we will draw up specific solutions to solve the issues and link them to the verification experiment.
⇒As soon as we get the budget from the prefecture, we will switch from the demonstration experiment version to the full-scale implementation version.
・Road map
September 2021: Budget for FY2022 to be incorporated, marketing (pilot versionrequirements to be defined)　
November 2021: Execution of funds, start of pilot version
April 2022: Start full version implementation　
 
Rationale
　Traceability of cattle and beef: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (maff.go.jp)
    https://www.maff.go.jp/j/syouan/tikusui/trace/
 
 If we can build a blockchain infrastructure in the government with these use cases, we can then expand it to various dApps solutions within the government. This project is a very important milestone toward this goal and the biggest opportunity to achieve this.
 
■Current Issues
 We need to build a consensus before we can get a budget from the government. In addition, it takes time to get the budget.Even if the project is successfully included in the next fiscal year's budget by September, it will not be eligible for execution in the next fiscal year's budget (from April 2022). In addition, it will take time to get the budget. We would like to proceed in the form of a demonstration experiment before that time, but due to financial problems, we participated in this Fund6.
 
■KPI
・Define design requirements for social use of ATALAPrism in Japan (developed country)
　 for the demonstration experiment.
・Through the demonstration experiments, we will define the requirements for specific
　 solution design led by the government. 
 
■Deliverables (Progress)
 Establishment of a strong and powerful relationship with the members of the prefectural assembly.An opinion exchange meeting was held at the prefectural government office with about 10 people in charge of related departments. We have already provided input on the necessity and usefulness of the prefecture's approach to the block chain.
■Budget request
　＄10,000
■Breakdown
The work period is expected to be about three months and 40 hours.
Labor cost (per hour) in Japan with skills above a certain level is about $30.
Labor cost (for four people): $4,800
PoC $5,000
To the prefectural government Transportation cost $200
Total  $10,000
 
This time, we are targeting the PoC stage, and we would like to make another proposal on Fund7 for further development of the pilot version and any missing funds.

Charles Hoskinson has recently expressed his exasperation with scammers & conmen who are offering to ""multiply your ADA"" and he suggested that there should be some policing of this matter to stop the scammers and to monitor the online space.
Watch this video to hear what he said about stopping Scams:

Part Transcript --------------------------------
In the event that certain companies are negligent in my view YouTube is highly negligent because of the giveaway scams that we continue to see so those of you who are in law enforcement and you're finally looking for something to do in cardano highly encourage you to start talking to each other form some groups, and really have a real dialogue, and go to catalyst and request some funds for fund six or fund seven specifically to start something to help the community in this respect it can be the development of bespoke software it can be the development of educational materials it could be things that can educate help law enforcement conduct investigations it can be all kinds of things that in your view as law enforcement experts could somehow assist mitigate or prevent scams from occurring inside the ecosystem. If you guys are willing to do that we can commit resources in two ways, several people that are on my security detail are former law enforcement I can certainly commit their time to assist in whatever group is formed, we also have cyber security experts at our firm, we can certainly commit some of their time there, and we also can commit money. So if you guys do something on catalyst and it gets approved, I will give matching funds to that ,up to a million dollars, depending upon how much you ask for to ensure that there's something there…..,

Initial Framework for Policing Scams & Threats
I believe that this requirement is in context with threats to the overall system and the damage done to the reputation.
I have created this acronym (ASTOP) & title for an activity that I believe should be included in our war rooms and with support from an extended network of people around the world.
These scams do not only happen in English, therefore we will need people around the world to spot these scams in other languages as they happen and report them to one or more central points for further action.
I will start by saying that this is an idea for a framework that will need to be built upon by lots of people around the world, many of whom will have skills I do not have. I am happy to work with other groups & organisations, input ideas to others or simply put this proposal out there for others to implement.
Bug Bounty Program
I am aware of the HackerOne bounty program for Cardano Launched in August, learn more here: https://hackerone.com/cardano-foundation?type=team, if I understand this properly they are incentivising to identification of bugs in the existing live blockchain and the live eco-system.
Disaster when all is at stake
If I understand this challenge correctly it is looking for ideas for the recovery of the Blockchain and to pro-actively identify potential problems before they go live (happy to be corrected in the comments).
Shadow Cardano
My proposal is to create one or more mirror, or shadow, Cardano blockchains, updated in real-time, that can run as ""virtual eco-systems"" where all types of tests can be carried out and scenarios tried with proposed or imagined applications.
Backup & Restore
One or more of these copies can be held in reserve as backup versions of the entire Cardano Blockchain, a procedure to shutdown and restore the blockchain to be ready in case of a catastrophic event.
Why call it a ""War Room""?
If you speak to any government they will quickly confirm that cyber warfare is a real and present danger, to protect Cardano we need to proactively engage with the digital enemies and take the fight to them before they can learning enough to damage our digital assets.
Only by having the correct mindset, which a war footing demands, will cyber threats and hackers be put on their back foot and be working more in a defensive fashion than an offensive fashion.
Location, Location, Location!
The Cardano eco-system must be monitored from more than one location, ideally from each continent and covering the most popular languages on that continent. Software must be developed to show everything being added to the blockchain in real time. It would be ideal to have a process where new applications submitted a notice to the war room so that potential threats could be headed off, although due to the decentralised nature of the blockchain this is something that needs to be discussed.
Build a knowledge base
A database would be built up of all known or imagined threats, a bounty system can be expanded for ideas, operatives would stress test everything and quarantine potential threats or risks until clarified. Staying decentralised, final actions to be voted on for further action, unless it is a recognised threat or something potentially critical.
The wild west
I think that we should be taking a frontier type mentality are so much in the digital space is unknown or unknowable until we see it appear before us. The basic system I am envisaging can be outlined with these colourful titles:
Sheriff - the sheriff would be a person in a management position who would have the final say on action to be taken against a scammer or a threat that has been reported via the deputies.
Deputy - A deputy would be a person attached to, or working inside a war room who would be the first point of contact and who would analyse the scam or threat to create a report to be submitted to the sheriff for urgent and immediate action.
Bounty hunter - a bounty hunter would be a recognised individual or group of individuals who would be known to the war room and would work remotely seeking out scams and threats in the system, parts of the war rooms task would be to develop tools such as bots to identify anomalies, keywords and key phrases. The bounty hunters would also focus on certain countries and jurisdiction where scams and threats were found to be prevalent.
Gunslinger - Once a course of action has been decided upon, and the maximum intelligence has been gathered about the scammer or threat, the gunslinger would be a protected individual that would take the necessary action to close down the scam or threat. These gunslingers need to be protected individuals to ensure there were no repercussions or reprisals.
And other parts of the war room's roll will be to develop close connections with all of the various platforms at management level in order to effectively close down scams once they have been identified.
Example Scams
I have personally noted give away ADA scams on telegram in the last seven days, I have used the available reporting facility to report each of these scams, the first one seems to have disappeared but the second one is still carrying on. I have also attempted to put posts with links to Charles Hoskinson's videos onto these channels but of course they are removed instantly by some type of bot, the other proactive way would be to find ways to contact the members of these sites to give them warnings and particularly the warning given by Charles Hoskinson ""we do not give away ADA"".
These are the scam channels:
""ADA Cardano Official"" 1592 Members (Seems to be stopped)
28/08/21 Reported: Cardano do not give away ADA Tokens
""Cardano Official Commuinty"" 765 Members (was still operating 01/09/21)

The Itsec aspect of running a stake pool is more than just your hardware and software. For example, what happens if the stake pool operator has an accident. You also need organizational and physical security measures. Have you a kind of Emergency manua, contact adresses, ...?
The first step in making the community aware is to do a self-audit. Every Stakepool owner can reflect on his own system and learn from it and improve. The community get a frameworks and important numbers and informations.
Milestone:
1. Create website (landing page)
2. Create a questionnaire and adapt it to the feedback from the community
3. Add the survey tool to the website
4. Motivate the stakepool owner
5. Communicate the results
Time schedule:
Start: 10/2021
Milestone 1-3 -> end of 2020
Milestone 4 -> Jan 2021
Milestone 5 -> Q2 2021
I believe that the big stake pools will need some kind of Itsec certification in the future. In a decentralized system, we have to push the small stakepool owners and improve their ITsec level. It is a process. The self audit will help to reflect and to get a feedback of the own status quo.
 
For Example:
The stakepools get a label Itsec Level 4 out of 5. The Label is valid just for one year. 
 
The Weak Point - How can you trust a label based on a self audit?
That's 100% true. You need to see it as a first step in a journey that will take place over the next few years. The next step of itsec standards and audits should be integrated into the cardano Foundation. (my opinion)
 
The budget is used for:
Website, Marketing, Communication 4000 $
Work hours  8000 $ (100-150h)

Disaster Recovery Funds
Setting aside funds that will be held for the purpose of helping SPOs recover in the event of a disaster scenario such as key SPOs shutting down their operations if adversarial regulations are passed that make it impossible for SPOs to operate legally. SPOCRA can allocate funds to help re-locate SPOs from a jurisdiction that passed disastrous regulations. 
The funds allocated to aid SPOs in the event of a regulation disaster would be held in a separate ADA wallet to appreciate over time. In the event SPOs need to tackle the risks associated with operating in a location that make it illegal to run a pool an application would be submitted to the SPOCRA board or eventually a request through a smart contract would be submitted to SPOCRA to request funding. Note: the funds allocated to disaster recovery would be solely for the purpose of holding in the event they are needed to aid SPOs in relocation and would not be used in the development of a smart contract or governance system. 
Education and Research (Preparedness) Funds
In addition, funds will be used for the purpose of education and research for viable relocation options. This would include research into the laws of potential jurisdictions that SPOs can move into as well as the costs & requirements to establish residency.  Funds allocated to research would be paid to professionals that provide relocation as a service to provide this information to SPOCRA.  
Understanding the processes of the various potential nations to relocate as efficiently as possible will be key to preparing for a disaster event such as adversarial regulations being passed into law. 
Legal Counsel & Defense Funds
Lastly, funds would also be used for lawyer fees to provide legal consultation to SPOCRA as the trade association is being established. Understanding the legal landscape and what potential laws/ regulations/ tax codes implicate for SPO businesses is still a gray area in most countries. Laws passed in the United States have a greater chance of influencing laws passed in other countries. There is not a dedicated law office proficient in matters concerning the blockchain space for SPOs that can identify potential threats and work to establish regulatory clarity & educate lawmakers so they do not create scenarios that would put SPO business owners at risk of running a stake pool operation illegally.
As a non-profit trade association for the stake pool operation industry SPOCRA must ensure we are operating according to laws and regulations pertaining to blockchain, cryptocurrency and stake pool operations. Our legal counsel provides SPOCRA with the most immediate updates concerning potential threats in the legal landscape of the blockchain space that can be accurately interpreted and disseminated to the entire SPO community.
Holding a lawyer under retainer for SPOCRA provides us with legal counsel over the ambiguous laws/ regulations in the blockchain space.  This means identifying and providing clarity on novel, emerging threats to the Cardano ecosystem as events unfold, i.e., potential laws being passed that can prohibit SPOs from running their businesses in the US legally would be a major assault on the backbone of the Cardano ecosystem if the result would mean many SPOs shutting down their operations.
These legal funds would also be held and used for addressing legal matters arising for community SPOs in the event of state & federal investigations or the need for regulatory defense.  Providing legal defense could benefit the entire SPO community where such cases could have cascading effects on shaping the laws in nations and states around the world regarding running a stake pool operation. 
 
Definition of Success:
Ultimately not needing to use these funds as the result of a disaster would be ideal. However, in the event a disaster does occur distributing funds to help key community SPOs recover successfully. Being prepared with the knowledge required, funds and professional help to react as quickly as possible to mitigate the disaster event assisting SPOs in relocation would mean success.
3 months
Acquiring professional help to acquire the information on most viable relocation possibilities and best methods to make this happen quickly. 
6 months
Providing educational content to the community to better prepare the SPO base in the event of adversarial regulation in specific jurisdictions. More operators preparing now with additional options for citizenship status would mean success for the entire Cardano ecosystem as this would mitigate the risk of a disaster such as many SPOs shutting down their operations. 
12 months
Established emergency communication channels to aid in the relocation of SPOs in the event of adversarial regulation passed into law. Legitimate preparedness and relocation processes laid out and proven through use by community SPOs.  
Budget:
$40,000 - Disaster recovery - held for the purpose of providing re-location assistance to community SPOs. 
$20,000 - Disaster preparedness - research & education into the best relocation spots and most efficient methods. 
$20,000 - Disaster defense - lawyer retainer fee for legal consultation and holding of funds for future legal aid.
 
Auditability:
All SPOCRA transactions can be viewed on Cardano blockchain explorers via searching for the public wallet address used to hold funds and create transactions.

Responding to a network failure begins with situational awareness. 
I propose to build a simple dashboard showing which stake pool nodes are reachable from different parts in the world. This dashboard should indicate which stake pools are up, down, and if network segmentation is a factor.
The status information and dashboard are served entirely from Amazon S3 (highly reliable data store). Since no public-facing server is required, and S3 is protected by Amazon against DoS and other attacks, the dashboard itself should remain available in the face of attack and most types of network failure. Also, S3 is extremely affordable for small amounts of data; I expect the dashboard to be extremely lightweight.
The idea is for servers located throughout the world to use cncli-ping to regularly probe all stake pool endpoints registered on the Cardano blockchain. Results of the ping are uploaded to S3 in JSON format. The dashboard, coded in HTML+Javasscript, loads the JSON status and display the results in a pretty table. 
We run the cncli-ping from various places in the world to test different network paths; the dashboard will present a table showing cncli-ping results from each geographic region (ping source) to each stake pool endpoint (ping destination).
For example, if an underwater cable between USA and Brazil is broken, Brazil-initiated probes might show USA pools as unreachable, and likewise USA-initiated probes might show Brazilian pools as unreachable. 
For another example, if a stake pool is offline, all cncli-ping locations should show the stakepool as unreachable.
This gives us a simple, effective, at-a-glance view of pool reachability from various points on the earth.
The deliverable for this project is the source code to run the cncli-ping nodes and dashboard, released under a permissive open source license. 
I estimate delivery around Oct-Nov 2021.
I consider this project a success if, after 2-6 months, myself and/or others use the software to host a publicly-available dashboard of stake pool reachability.

Disaster Recovery planning is critical for the Cardano Ecosystem, yet clearly underappreciated. F6: Disaster: When all is at stake only has 6 proposals with $150,000 of funding.
 
We will run an education and awareness campaign about Cardano Disaster Recovery Planning. 
 
The campaign will focus on
- Researching disaster risks, disaster recovery strategies, and the current state of disaster recovery preparedness in Cardano
- Educational material and documentation
- Outreach to the global Cardano community
- Workshops 
- Outreach to SPOs
- Outreach to proposers for this Catalyst Campaign. 
- Bringing together the Cardano community to discuss disaster recovery strategies
 
Documentation will include
- Document all disaster recovery tests and SPO participation
- Compile all disaster recovery protocols and proposals
- Provide links to disaster communication channels
- guidelines and recommendations for SPOs
- stake pool network benchmarks
- risk sources
 
This education and awareness campaign should lead to much higher rates of participation in disaster recovery planning by SPO's and the general Cardano community . As mentioned before, we believe the bottleneck is education and awareness, not funding.
 
Funding Breakdown
Research & Documentation               $3,000
Recovery Test Support                       $3,000
Workshops & Community                   $3,000
Outreach and Awareness                   $3,000
 
Success Criteria
 
- Gain strong understanding of Cardano Disaster Recovery through research
- Stimulate community discussions
- Increase SPO participation in disaster recovery tests by 2x
- Ensure comprenhsive documentation, fill gaps as much as possible
- Present our research at Educational Workshops
- Encourage at least 50 proposals for this campaign in F7 and future funds

## What is Blockfrost.io?
Blockfrost.io is an instant, public and freely accessible API that removes infrastructure obstacles for developers so that everyone can start building (d)apps on Cardano. With Blockfrost.io, developers can start doing what they love ❤️, without the need for running and maintaining additional infrastructure and tooling themselves.
At the moment, we have more than 2,500 developers already onboarded in Blockfrost!
 
## What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is a software component used for event monitoring and alerting. It is used to monitor metrics from other software components. SPOs are using it to monitor their own nodes and relays.
 
## Deliverables and roadmap
We would like to build a Prometheus exporter that will provide metrics about the Cardano blockchain from the 3rd party, which is Blockfrost. It will enable SPOs and node operators to have a pulse on the Cardano chain and can react if they find about a discrepancy on their own infrastructure.
We will release the first version of this software within 6 weeks after funding, including documentation and tests.
 
## Relevant experience
Five Binaries is an infrastructure development company. We're Cardano pioneers - with the first Cardano block minted on an aeroplane, first stake pool on the ITN and the first Shelley transaction on the mainnet.
We are the creators of Blockfrost.io. We are participants in Alonzo since the Blue testnet and we are Plutus pioneers.
With 24 proposals already funded across several funds in the past, we are trusted by the community. To find out more about our progress on making the Cardano infrastructure better, check out our Catalyst dashboard page at https://catalyst.fivebinaries.com/.
We are trusted by customers such as Emurgo, Trezor or Cardano Foundation. To get in touch or find more information about us, please visit https://fivebinaries.com/.
 
## Budget
We estimate this project will take about 3 weeks of active development and about 2 weeks of maintenance for the duration of the year.
 
## License
The entire outcome of this project will be open sourced under Apache License 2.0.

The best defence is a good offence - we shouldn't wait when threat disrupts the network, but build mechanism for whistleblowing and critical information aggregation about ecosystem participants.
At first we can make all whistleblowing and network participants data available via public record and trust scores, but in the future it could be used as a defensive mechanism against multipooling (on-chain Oracle for submitting proves of multiple pools).
The users are still in control, but they will have a verifiable information on which they can build systems incentivizing Cardano network security from reporting and warning about shady projects (e.g. reporting bot farms and shady practices or missed deliverables) to measuring network security and identifying risks and providing mechanism for Cardano telemetry integration into decision making (e.g. it's extremely easy for human to detect multi pool operator, but extremely hard for the machine, if protocol for challenging claims is robust enough it could be even baked into the pool rewards achieving the desired network properties).

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


As we all know stake pools are being run on servers, clouds, etc. There is currently a lack of cybersecurity awareness and not many ways to prevent sophisticated attacks like a mass attack campaign against Cardano's ecosystem. CardSec is aiming to build open-source powerful easy to use package with penetration testing tools for security assessment and security guides along with it solely for servers running the Cardano nodes. We will be researching all the common services where nodes are hosted and will be designing the tool accordingly.
We will create a user-friendly easy-to-install python package for SPOs to test their systems.
CardSec aims to roll out in different phases, with each phase we will be releasing in-depth, easy-to-understand DIY articles on medium and video guides on Youtube. 
Note: All the tools and guides will be based on five stages of the NIST Cyber Security framework: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
We will be requesting funding in batches.
(Fund-6)
Phase-1: Creating a tool to assess server load(RAM, CPU, disk & network usage) and tracking OS & software updates. Developing vulnerability scanning scripts detecting CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) among stake pool VPS, clouds, etc. 
Phase-2: Ddos 101 prevention guide for different kinds of cloud services, server machines, etc where the block and relay nodes are hosted and looking forward to building a safe stress testing environment for servers running the node.
(Fund-7 onward)
Phase-3: By now all the important security endpoints must have been strengthened. So, now we will issue response guides for what to do in the situation of any attack to prevent any large damage.
Phase-4: Integrating OSINT mapping tools like zoom eye to find out if a particular server is exposed or leaking any sensitive details. Issuing personal security guides and video tutorials for SPOs and delegators both covering attacks such as browser-based, wireless, and physical attack vectors to prevent leakage of sensitive wallet or server information.
(Fund-8 onward)
Phase-5: Integrating all the scripts and guides into a single CLI open-source tool on GitHub and developing a notification system for stake pool owners to upgrade their servers from time to time as new security updates come.
Phase-6: Developing a GUI version of the tool.
 
This will harden and strengthen all of Cardano's stake pools, node running servers and prepare them to face any unforeseen disruptions. Our goal is to establish a security standard among SPOs and delegators so most of the delegators are attracted only to the pools which are security conscious. 
We have already included what success will look like in the phases mentioned above.
 
Roadmap
The roadmap is carefully designed in accordance with what we are trying to achieve as researching, building, and testing these scripts takes time.

Fourth Quarter, 2021: Phase 1                  (Month 1-3)
First Quarter, 2022: Phase 2 and 3          (Month 3-6)  
Second Quarter, 2022: Phase 4 and 5     (Month 6-9)
Third Quarter, 2022: Phase 6                    (Month 9-12)

FAQs
Q. Will CardSec be open source and decentralize?
A. Yes, we will be making it fully open source after each phase so everyone can utilize the resources and since it is open-source anyone from the community can contribute to it making it fully decentralized.
Q. Will anyone require any prior pen-testing skills to use CardSec?
A. No, CardSec will be very user-friendly. All you need is basic Linux knowledge until we release our Phase-6.
Q. Why are we the right persons?
A. We run a stake pool ourselves, and developing another Cardano Project (deqree.in) and both of us are Plutus pioneers so we possess a deep understanding of the Cardano ecosystem.
 
Future Goals
Integrating the tool with Cardano's blockchain with a reward, security rating, and a notification system for SPOs with the help of smart contracts for running these assessment tests. Setting up threat intel monitoring to identify malicious actors.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
We will use our skills to provide a Critical Event Management (CEM) Platform for all Cardano Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) that will ensure consistent operation of the network through various disruptions or disasters.
Benefits from Cardano Heartbeat CEM will include:

Early notification of relevant threats to your stake pools operation.
The automation of incident response activities and resiliency protocol.
Rapid recovery of stake pool operations, should key components fail in a disaster.
Assurance to your delegators when your pool verifiably exceeds the standards of resiliency.

Benefits from the development of the Cardano Heartbeat CEM include:

Complete self-assessment of your stake pools risk profile, motivating SPOs to move from a reactive crisis response approach to proactive crisis prevention.
Better networking with SPOs on a regional basis to identify unthought-of threats and hazards.
Development of Best Practices amongst Stake Pool Operations.

How will the Cardano Heartbeat CEM be designed and developed?
First, understand that a Critical Event Management Platform employs various technologies and data to take manual processes and automate them to make the early notification, expedite recovery, and maintain operations during emergencies.
A CEM platform consists of three key elements and our approach to addressing these elements:
1. Risk Analysis
Utilizing the experience and training through FEMA and the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium, we will complete and provide a Threat & Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment & Stakeholder Preparedness Review (THIRA/SPR assessment) to be completed by a certified TEEX Infrastructure Protection Professional.
Development of ""Stake Pool Resiliency and Security"" self-assessment survey. This quiz-style survey compiled by multiple SPOs in this project and the greater SPO community will provide an accurate assessment of current capabilities across the network. The result will benefit the Cardano Community of SPO's with a verifiably documented understanding of the risks and hazards, which will determine the level of capability needed to address those risks. This path allows us to effectively estimate the network's current risk and resiliency, identify gaps, and justify the approach for addressing them through tools like the Cardano Heartbeat CEM.
2. Mass notification system
Similar to tools like Mellium, participation in the Cardano Heartbeat CEM will grow into the immediate notification of emerging threats like hurricanes, civil unrest, or natural disasters near-critical data centers and bare metal SPOs alike, as well as impulse disaster notifications like seismic activity or cyber terrorism.
3. Incident management/recovery
Based upon provided Risk Analysis Data and Mass Notification Participation, SPOs can now prepare for legitimate threats in their area of operation. Ideally, resiliency options are implemented pre-incident and tested for operability.
Knowing the risks, networking with SPOs, and developing best practice protocols will allow stronger responses to active incidents and highly expedited recovery time through pre-designed failover systems and tested alternatives.

Vision
Our vision is to establish a co-creation space in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It will be set up as a social business and become a hub for Cardano developers, entrepreneurs, students, and freelancers. Endubis Hub strives to become a physical platform in a stimulating and inspiring environment from where Cardano Enthusiasts cannot only work but also share knowledge, interact with one another, innovate solutions for the future and make ideas grow.
Open Space
The open space in the ground area will be semi-open to the public. This means that those within the Cardano community in Ethiopia can come over and interact/ work from there. They are free to use the cafe and bar area as well as the backyard. This is especially attractive for new members of the community that want to get more understanding of Cardano and the possibilities.
Co-working Area
The second floor will be only open for members. They have the choice between different membership deals. Membership for the first 3 months will be dedicated only to Cardano developers, Plutus students, and entrepreneurs and will be free of charge. 
From the 3rd month until the 6th month period the space will be open for a wider community of developers and entrepreneurs for a monthly membership fee but still remain free for Cardano developers.
After the 6th month period, Cardano developers will have to submit a business plan and apply for a time period of their development project, and depending on their project (decided by all members) they will still be eligible for the free use of the space. 
Membership Fees
The Membership deals will be

Full-time Membership: 6 days a week with 24 hours access and will cost 100 USD per month. Dedicated desk
Limited Membership: 3 days a week with limited access and a price of 80 USD. Guaranteed seat
Meeting room rental: Teams could rent out an extra room on an hourly basis.

Self Service
In order to keep costs low, the cafe will be self-service. A limited number of soft drinks, as well as snacks, will be offered the prices will be listed up and a cash box will be available there. Additionally, users can bring their own snacks and use the kitchen to warm up their food.
Platform for Sharing
Even more than a place to work from, creatives are in need of a physical platform to interact and share knowledge on a professional level. Endubis hub will encourage this as much as possible through specific features that can support this. 
We will install a big users board with Polaroid photos of the community members (Citizens Board). Around the pictures, there will be information about the members; their competencies, what kind of support they could need, projects they are currently working on, job offers, and searches. Even more, members can also offer time swapping with others through the wall, so a UI/UX designer can borrow some hours from a backend developer in exchange for doing UX designs.
The citizen board is the formal space that ties the network together. It is where you find out what people are working on and how you can help. It's where you find out whom to ask for what.
Next to it will be a little table with a desktop. On it not only can the users go online, but there is also a database with contacts, information, and references that members can add about themselves if they want to. Additionally, there will be a complete reference guide and well-organized learning materials that will be updated by the community.
Target Groups
We have identified three target groups that Endubis Hub wants to attract.

Students of creative and tech schools: Student from higher education facilities in Addis Ababa.
The aspiring entrepreneur: A young entrepreneur that is looking for inspiration to start a business. We also considered people that are currently employed but are planning to start their own business within the near future.
The freelancer: Freelance developers and designers looking to expand on their skills and find new opportunities

Marketing Channel
The only marketing channel that Endubis Hub will use is word of mouth. This is due to two major reasons:

The community, especially the core team, is worried about having too many strangers in the backyard
The capacity of the space is very limited

In the early phase, people will be invited to come to the space. Those that find out about the space are able to visit it and use the cafe. However only if they have been invited and applied for a membership can they have a more permanent desk solution or use the citizen wall.
Implementation Plan
++Renovation Phase:++October 2021 - November 2021
A design team closely related to the community will plan out how to set up the whole interior as well as exterior. Eventually, the community will renovate the entire interior of the space up to a point where it is ready to be furnished. The space is already a functioning area, so the renovation will not be extensive and the major works should be done by the end of November.
++Finishing off phase:++November 2021 - December 2021
In this period most construction work should be done. While there are still some minor adjustments to be done, the space can slowly be reopened for evening gatherings. It is continuously brought to life while the rooms are slowly being furniture with finding from the flea market, second-hand stores, and self-made furniture.
Testing Phase: January 2022
This phase should be seen as a testing and experimenting phase for the community in an informal setting. It can be done by working from the space and just using it frequently. In this phase, we will determine What works? What doesn't? How should the furniture be rearranged? What could be changed? How does the citizen wall work?
Moreover, this phase should be used to actively start thinking about who to invite as initial citizens. Consciously building up a bigger network, the kick-off can be promoted towards individuals. This can also be done through a series of regular events such as meetups or workshops in the location.
Operating the co-working Space: February 2022 and on
The fundament is set, things have been prototyped, tried over and over again. Now it is time to get into business. Are there too few users? Do they need to make more promotions? Or is it actually too full? Opening hours and rules can be adjusted.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before going to the implementation plan, we would like to present some reasons for our establishment of Cardano Vietnam Information Centre.
5.1. The world is becoming FLATTER.
Whether American, Russian, Ethiopian, or Vietnamese...through the Internet (Google, Youtube, The Moods...and other free platforms), through global cooperation programs, ...we will gradually have the same ability to access and exploit the vast resources of human knowledge, we will have equal opportunities to access the most advanced educational systems in the world...
Therefore, the gaps in technology, techniques, culture, services... will gradually narrow and be equal among all countries and regions .
The faster something grows, the stronger it grows, the faster it flows to the ""valleys""
Blockchain technology in general and the Cardano platform in particular is no exception, will also ""MUST"" flow into the ""valleys"".
And Vietnam is one of such ""valleys"".
We are facing a great opportunity to enter the Blockchain market:
- In recent years, Blockchain is developing strongly all over the world, gradually showing its practicality in the economy, health care, education...
- On December 16, 2020, the Prime Minister of Vietnam officially included Blockchain Technology in the List of Digital Technology fields that need to focus on research and development to actively participate in the revolution of Industry No.4.
- Vietnam is still in the golden population period, young people are enthusiastic, passionate about technology, ready to accept new challenges, desire to change their personal lives, raise the national position...
Now or never.
We need to win a ""place"" in this ""historic technological revolution"".
Otherwise, we will be left behind the rest of the World.
""Vietnamese can run 500 mph or 5 mph. It is fine. But the important thing is that you have to run. If you stand still, the world will ignore you."" – Thomas Loren Friedman (author of ""The World Is Flat"")
--> Blockchain technology in general and Cardano in particular will ""flow"" into Vietnam, irresistible. But in order to accelerate, we need a ""Canal"" – that is Cardano Vietnam Information Center (1)
5.2. The need to access information of the Vietnamese community
Only Cardano Community in Vietnam, we have about 40,000 members (Telegram and Facebook). This number will be much larger when Cardano is getting hotter and hotter. Most of them want to find out information about the project they are interested in, but have language barriers, expertise, and time constraints.
Spontaneous individuals/groups form their own communities, resulting in inconsistent and non-standardized, repetitive, and uncensored sources of information and documents; follow the same Cardano project but the community will have to join a lot of different groups, causing time consuming, and confusing information…
After nearly 4 years of taking care of and following the community, and most recently, surveying the Vietnam Cardano community through asking basic questions (about 20 questions) about Cardano as well as the Cardano ecosystem. I found that only about 1/5 of the participants answered the question correctly. The rest answered wrong or did not know. This result shows the sad reality: Cardano has been introduced since 2015 (ADA- a native token launched in 2017), but most of the Cardano Vietnam community doesn't know the basics. So what are they investing in? What type of investment? Honestly, they're investing in something they don't know what it is. This is the biggest risk when investing in finance.
The results of the investigation show that the main reason for 90% of them not knowing or answering the question incorrectly is: they want to understand more about Cardano but do not understand English, especially Blockchain English. Without English skills, it is difficult for them to access official information and documents from Cardano. And even if they have official sources of information and documents, they can't read &understand it.
During nearly 4 years of establishment, Cardano Vietnam team has been translating information and documents (IOHK' blog, Video, Event...) into Vietnamese to share with the community. We have also built a database to create Bots to help the community look up information on their own (May 2021); we've editted Cardano related videos for the community to understand; we've participated in IOHK's programs ( Shelley Summit 2020, Cardano 360, Catalyst TowHall...), Cardano Foundation's (like The Cardano Foundation's Strategy...) ...
But we only shared directly on Telegram, You can check out some of our translations and Bot here:
https://t.me/CardanoVietnam/189793
https://t.me/CardanoVietnam/188645
https://t.me/CardanoVietnam/188062
https://t.me/CardanoVietnam/177707
https://t.me/CardanoVietnam/184235
.....
That was a mistake, because the community will be very difficult to find them again for reference.
The community wants to understand Cardano but doesn't understand English. We understand English, translates information & documents for the community, but only saves it on Telegram, but has not been centrally saved on the website, youtube, or blog...(2)
(1) & (2) -->We realize that it is necessary to establish Cardano Vietnam Information Center as a center to store official information & documents about Cardano in Vietnamese.

■Why did we start this proposal?
 
We have planned as 3 steps for constructing new Ecology-Economic (ECO2) system based on Cardano block chain on our area (Yoshino-gawa city, Tokushima, Japan).
The collaboration of local government is great advantage for grow up Cardano community.
As Dr. Charles Hoskinson say the number of ADA holder is quite important for Cardano growth
and community is power!
At least in our area, the number of citizens are nearly 40 thousand!
Furthermore, if this project is go well, other countries especially near to our area will attend similar project or our system. Finally, millions of people potentially become Cardano community member and may be ADA holder.
 
■3-STEP-Milestone...This project will performed in 3 step describing bellow.
 
●STEP1 (Fund 6, present proposal)
The Cardano seminor for citizens. (Total 3 times : every month seminar will be held)
$ 3000 (Oct. Nov. Dec.)
As described in attached PDF slide, the understanding of the citizen is quite important in our project.
The Cardano seminor will grow up the member agree with our project.
The key point is the quality of Japan Cardano community member (ADA holder). The Cardano open chat member is now reach to 2400. Almost all members are gently, kindly and having lot of benefit. This is quite special situation compared to other Crypto community. Probably, long-term educational activity inside/outside open chat make this situation.
When, we consider this situation, the economic event for Japanese ADA holder may give benefit to the citizen.
However, there should be attracting things in our area, which is performed/constructed by citizens.
Of course natural and historical resources such as temple, castle and beautiful situation is important.
However, less communication between the citizens and ADA holder cannot continue this new economic challenge based on Cardano.
So it is important to understand of Cardano vision and quality ADA holder for the citizens.
Also for the online event or system, the Cardano vision understanding for the engineer is required.
For these reason, we will grow up the understanding and start education.
From October we will start Cardano seminor.
 
●STEP2 (Fund 7 or later $xxx)
After making understanding of Cardano vision for the citizens.
We will perform test case event using ADA or Cardano system.
Citizens will know Cardano is good and special. Moreover, this system bring benefit for the citizens.
 
●STEP3(Fund 8 or later $xxx)
The new Cardano eco system with original token (Hotaru : Fire fly Token).
Since our area is recognized as natural monument are for Fire fly. And almost all Japanese consider Fire fly is beautiful but very difficult to meet.
We will held the special Fire fly and related event for ADA holder using Hotaru token.
Since natural monument is quite sensitive, the gently behavior and limited number of people are required. Usually the citizens do not collaborate with other people. However, after understanding Cardano vision, they will accept ADA holder and enjoy close relations with each other.
 
■Team Member
6 directors and 4 management members from 3 youth business groups
6 people from the city's public servants, 1 person from the regional revitalization cooperation team
One Tokushima University professor as an advisor
 
■Intellectual property right
Deliverables and reports from meet-ups funded by the Fund will be widely published to the community.
 
■Breakdown of funds
Transportation costs, meeting room charges, labor costs related to the preparation of materials related to this work, etc.
 
■Potential needs for our meet-up

Create platform & YouTube Channels allowing translators to make their portfolio by translating blockchain & Cardano education and news",11,"Thursday, 26 August 2021 03:15",Rik,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Rik/3069291-48088,Alain J.,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Alain-J/3075058-48088,12380,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The general problem the Langbassadors address by making multi-language content is that only 9% of the world knows how to speak english. Cardano aims to be the blockchain of the world so Cardano world adoption is what we all strive for. 
To achieve that we require translators & massive amounts of content.
Second part of the problem addressed with this proposal is that the developing countries are suffering hard under Covid & even more under the economic disaster lockdowns caused over there at this very moment, with no safety net available.
Those translators active in the Cardano community have a hard time finding jobs & monetizing their skills.
What is the evident solution ?
SNC provides a platform where translation services can be offered commercially and translators can connect with Catalyst Projects.
The Safety in Numbers LangBassadors are proud to present blockchaintranslation.io.
The long term plan is to make this platform consisting of 3 pillars, each addressing a different need for translators involved within Cardano & help organise them. This Fund 6 proposal asks funding for the commercial part of the platform.
 
Our Collaboration:
This translator platform is part of a larger global translating project ""blockchaintranslation.io"" which includes 3 major pillars:

commercial platform - Safety in Numbers (Fund5 and Fund6)
translator platform - Project CTS (Fund6)
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Translator-Collaboration-Platform/366922-48088
news platform (Fund7)

 
What are the wins and how to leverage this untapped potential ?
First WIN WIN :
The Safety in Numbers LangBassadors developed( and proved it works during Fund5 ) a concept in which quality animation & video content is produced enabling a single animation to be produced in an infinite number of languages.
At the same time, by translating blockchain education native speakers and professional translators can become real blockchain translation experts themselves .
Translators & narrators actually educate themselves while educating others.
How does this mechanism work ?
SNC provides content like Youtube videos /animations and a translation services platform blockchaintranslation.io
Every commercial translator or native speaker can train themselves with the content the Langbassadors provide
By doing so they slowly turn into blockchain translators. The choice to commercialize that blockchain translation skill is open to anyone translating 1 piece of content a month ( averaging 700 words ). It's the only 'contribution' asked to advertise their services as native speakers or professional translators on the platform.
Second WIN WIN :
A glamour model invests in pictures creating a dazzling portfolio.
Similarly, aspiring commercial translators on blockchaintranslation.io can promote and demonstrate their skills with their translated version of the content on the LangBassadors media while helping to educate their language community.
This way we create more and more Cardano & blockchain content on the LangBassadors YouTube and other media channels.
Meanwhile general Cardano & blockchain adoption increases. Subsequently an increasing number of Catalyst projects can start finding translators on blockchaintranslation.io
So why should cardano care about translation anyway ?
Well, the mission of cardano is pretty clear : ""bank the unbanked"".
Now picture the profile of someone that falls under that category…

That unbanked person has no internet access or at best a very limited and unstable one
Also No or very limited experience with applications on computer or mobile phones
No familiarity with basic general computer and internet technology
Likely does not speak English.

So how can we give that person a fair shot at inclusion ?
A first priority is giving them internet access : That's why projects like WorldMobile are so important :
Onboarding 100000 in Tanzania ( and on Cardano ), their mission is to ""Connect the unconnected"" .
Africa at the moment has geographically less than 10 % of internet coverage at this point in time. The first requirement to include that particular Cardano Mission profile is a basic understanding of general computer, internet and blockchain lexicon. Every house needs a foundation.
During our translations of our first 5 videos the Langbassadors learned that a lot of concepts known in European languages simply don't even exist in other languages. Before someone can actively participate in Catalyst as proposer or even voter, ELI 5 education is the foundation :
Simplify, Summarize. The leap from going from absolutely nothing to blockchain is gigantic. Final requirement is giving all that news & education in their native language.
The task is vital to lift up the developing countries, the reason why Cardado needs to be the frontrunner in providing those translations. Cardano is one of the very few blockchains really aiming to become the blockchain of the world
For that you need more than the 9% English speakers.
Other blockchains might help providing blockchain education and content in other english and non-english languages but they only will bother for 'commercially interesting languages like Spanish, Chinese or Japanese.
If not Cardano, who else would do it for the developing countries in Africa since it has no great wealth as of yet ?
In the end the basic truth is that in order to be included people need to understand what blockchain and Cardano is about
A level playing field is most needed for non-english speakers from currently commercially uninteresting language communities
Both education and translation are unfortunately enough long-term investments.
Creating quality content and developing new block skin lexicons in non-european languages are works that take years.
Making the task even more difficult is a channel needs to provide massive amounts of content to become attractive to subscribers.
Results are long-term and the creation is extremely time consuming. But doesn't Cardano choose the long term path in coding as well ?
The problem is clear, but there are advantages as well:
Education is the ultimate flywheel accelerator.
Once basic educational content is created, that quality content educates for years to come so you can't do it too early, only too late. After publication it starts informing people for years and years after when the quality is there. The basics of blockchain & Cardano don't change that much, it evolves.
Blockchain lexicons in non-european languages will also be used forever and form the basis on how people will communicate with each other.
Let's give those people the basics and the language they require so we can properly welcome them in the Cardano family.
If the Cardano Foundation really onboards 100 million people by end 2022 and 1 billion by 2026 we need to hurry rather than worry if we are early.
Unfortunately, Short Term KPI's in reality are near impossible to predict.
Truthfully, they are not important in the short run, as first the massive task needs to be completed of creating enough quality content about the basics.
Do you subscribe to a channel with just a handful of videos ? ...
The need and return for this task will depend on where and when the government deals get implemented by the Cardano Foundation. Once those contracts are onboarded on Cardano via Atala, no doubt they will search for content that explains this whole new technology.
Short summary : The Langbassadors want to offer the commercial pillar of blockchaintranslations.io to anybody wanting to help educate about blockchain and Cardano in other languages. Langbassadors translate to help educate others and by doing so train themselves as well as translation experts.
The platform offers the opportunity to monetize those skills commercially or connect with Catalyst projects looking for a specific translator on our blockchaintranslations.io platform .
We hope on the support of the Cardano community in accomplishing that task.
So as KPI, the SNC Langbassadors intend to create the commercial part of the platform blockchaintranslations.io so anyone doing 1 ( or more ) translations a month of Langbassadors content.
This 'Find a Translator'  platform will be translated in

Minimum 8 Languages within the 3 months of the launch
Minimum 12 Languages within the 6 months of the launch
Minimum 20 Languages within the 12 months  : at least 10 European languages + 10 non European languages

Today, many university students are interested in blockchain but they don't know where to start and get involved with the ecosystem.
At the same time, city leaders seek ways to retain college graduates and attract talented professionals by launching new industries and fostering innovation.
With this pilot proposal, our aim is to launch Cardano Community Hubs by starting with local colleges and universities. We will engage with college students by hosting hackathons and co-creation sessions. We seek to build upon this engagement by launching broader community hubs, seeded by local students.
We aim at operating on two levels:

Meta problem of retaining talented college grads
Problem sensing at local level and onboarding college students and recent graduates to identify local problems and to design solutions (Victor and James will apply their experience in applied solutions when facilitating local events)

College towns often serve as innovation hubs. Let's build on this tradition by fostering/leveraging university relationships to create models for local hubs and widespread adoption.
In order to drive adoption and awareness of Cardano, we must emphasize how it can be used to address existing problems. In our cities, leaders seek new ways to encourage recent college graduates to stick around, build lives, and contribute to local economies. The birth of a new industry provides an opportunity for new expert hubs to emerge.
Can we create buzz in local governments by showing that we can engage with college students and even make an impact by keeping graduates around?

As I'm in Project Catalyst Fund1, I had a proposal ""Cardano Hub"" 
You can check it:
Fund1: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Hub/316096-48088
Fund2:  https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Cardano-Hub/323284-48088
 
After that Charles Hoskinson gave a speech on Community Led Hubs. Of course, most probably it's only a coincidence, but now in Project Catalyst, there is a category for this. 
So I decided to submit Community Hub idea once again, but increasing the focus on the bigger geography - Eastern Europe and decreasing the budget. 
I think first of all it will be necessary to focus on the incentives than on some physical location of the hub.
So such incentives would be:
- Developer evangelism (explaining how and why it's good to develop on Cardano)
- Local communication with businesses, NGO and government agencies
- Localization/translation help and support
- Meetup organization 
- Cardano popularization
- Cardano and crypto education

🔍 Details 
Goals:


Establish a safe and highly accessible hub within the Cardano ecosystem and Catalyst Swarm Community for independent cultural communities consisting of autonomous, self-organized, grassroots arts and cultural producers. The Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC) Hub - is envisioned to close the knowledge-gap between those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and blockchain and raise awareness about the opportunities they could access through education of these topics and by being integrated into expert communities.


Onboard a maximum of 8 international keyplayers and network leaders, which are established female & queer artists, activists, and cultural space organizers - to the Cardano Community through three educational workshops. Both groups would then collaborate to explore what potential the Hub has for local and transnational social impact.


Enhance the representation of independent arts and cultural producers (including queer,) BIPOC (Black, Indigious and people of color) and female communities) within the Cardano Community and build new alliances and areas for collaboration between the two groups of stakeholders.


 

Further empower communities of arts and cultural actors by building out the GADAC Hub into a Distributed Cooperative Organization (DisCO). WIth a DisCO governance structure, artists and other members of cultural communities can track contributions more effectively, allowing for the remuneration of care work and other intangible contributions. A DisCO also allows for autonomy from governments and other potentially repressive structures (particularly regarding communities and spaces within semi to fully authoritarian and/or corrupt political contexts), including the Game A, zero-sum status quo. 

 
 
 
Background and Overall Mission:
This proposal will initiate a three-month experiment in communication and understanding between existing Cardano Community members and artists, activists, and self-organized cultural collectives from the networks of Space of Urgency and United We Stream. The arts and cultural communities of Space of Urgency and United We Stream represent various social and cultural backgrounds from cities across the world such as: Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Budapest, Detroit, Lisbon, New York City, Mexico City, Paris, Kiev, Tbilisi , San Francisco, São Paulo, and Sydney. The network's foundation is comprised of subculture actors in night club communities, cultural grassroot spaces, and activist networks for feminist and queer rights in over 114 cities.
Self-organized, independent, grassroots cultural spaces and their vibrant communities - made up of autonomous collectives, artists and activists - are culturally determined social and political spaces created by and for a community. These are 'Space(s) of Urgency' and they are in a precarious position. Their survival is largely determined by real estate privatization and gentrification, yet these spaces play an important role by providing a shelter for cultural communities that lack support from the state or mainstream institutions. At the moment, spaces of urgency and the communities behind them are very compromised due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only exacerbated pre-existing issues of lack of funding and resources, a politically disabling environment, corporate takeovers, gentrification, commodification, social stigmatization, and marginalization. We see a large opportunity for a meaningful long-term integration of these communities within the Cardano ecosystem, since they are self-organized by origin and driven to upscale/increase social impacts beyond their spaces on a more transnational level. We believe that the Cardano Community and the methods behind developing the blockchain from the bottom up and with well thought out, peer-reviewed research, is more in-line with the collaborative and community-driven spaces we're working with.
At this moment, there is little knowledge within those communities about the possibilities to leverage their social impact by building on the Cardano blockchain. We see a huge opportunity for cross-pollinating unique knowledge between the cultural actors and the Cardano Community, since the cultural actors can benefit in many ways from the tools Cardano has to offer and in return Cardano becoming part of a worldwide network of diverse subcultural actors and community activists - including artists, musicians, cultural organizers, feminist communities & queer communites - to eventually drive further adoption by young people and those outside of the tech community.
 
The Team:
We're a group of activists, community organizers, entrepreneurs, researchers, writers, and artists working together to establish a Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC). Through this networked system and platform our aim is to create tools for autonomous, nonhierarchical, self-organized communities to efficiently and fairly govern, track contributions (especially community care and pro bono work) and remuneration, establish scalability.
After working for 10 years directly with artist and cultural communities, primarily those which have been marginalized by mainstream society and the status quo economic system, we've come to understand that new resilience strategies are needed - strategies that eliminate the need for government dependence and redistribution structures with little ROI. During the last years, we have facilitated substantive dialogue and debates and organized numerous conferences and events with interdisciplinary actors such as political agents, local governments, artists, and cultural communities. Establishing GADAC Hub is a natural next step in the progression of our work and a method we believe will successfully bring in the arts and cultural communities into the Cardano Catalyst ecosystem.

Space of Urgency (SoU): (Liese Kingma, Lucas Counter, Heather Brown): Space of Urgency´s mission is to empower the visibility and resilience of independent cultural spaces and their communities, by sharing stories, knowledge and tools for tangible solidarity in times of crisis. Expertise in designing and hosting workshops and knowledge exchange programs, and developing cultural community projects that brings collectives together, builds trust, and fosters deep knowledge exchange for social impact and community resilience. The project was founded in Berlin by a three person core team.

 

United We Stream (UWS): (Anna Harnes & Danaja Volk): Expertise in marketing and global outreach media strategies for social impact. Project team includes six Berlin-based members. The cultural platform was initiated in Berlin in March 2020 as the club scene's response to COVID-19 and has since gone far beyond that to advocate for the preservation and sustainable development of club culture, diversity, and equality through streaming, partnerships, and campaigns. The global movement has involved over 2,200 artists in 117 cities. The Berlin-based association is the umbrella for the worldwide network of individuals, clubs, and collectives.

📊 Milestone plan 
 
Timeline:
Project duration: 3 months (December 2021 - February)
Step 1: The project launch will take place at the Frei(t)räume (Envisioning Free Space) conference in Berlin (27.11.2021) - a nighttime culture conference organized by members of the Space of Urgency project in collaboration with United We Stream and the Stadt Nach Acht (City After 8) conference. A major focus of this year's conference is 'disruptive technologies', which should provide a fruitful environment for the initial engagement of cultural and community-driven spaces and connecting them with Cardano & Catalyst representatives and our project.
Step 2: After that, artists and cultural actors - including key figures from the feminist and queer scenes and BIPOC communities - will be onboarded via a purpose-built Discord server. This will be a starting point for building trust in the Cardano ecosystem and act as an accessible entry point where potential Catalyst Community members can gain baseline knowledge of Cardano, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain among their peers. Taking inspiration from the first Swam session online meetings - GADAC will develop in a similar community oriented way by starting small and expanded based on the needs of the community.
Step 3: Once we have successfully onboarded upto 8 members, we'll begin rolling out our program of three workshops, beginning with an introduction workshop, and followed by two workshops focused on specific projects (use cases) within the Cardano ecosystem that can be leveraged by the community hub. We will invite various members of the Cardano Catalyst Community to present specific elements of the workshop program that demonstrate the potential of Cardano.
 
Technical Information:
We'll be introducing the Hub for Independent Cultural Communities with a mix of digital tools, they include:

Zoom: online communication and workshop hosting

 

Miro: workshop aid and documentation

 

Discord: for community building, information exchange & consolidating the Independent Cultural Communities Hub

 

United We Stream (UWS): the live streaming network will take care of the recording and distribution of the workshop content to different channels (Facebook, YouTube Twitter, Discord) and also crosspost the stream via the global UWS network of stakeholders. UWS takes care of the communication campaign surrounding the project to create optimal understanding of the topics and to target audiences beyond the 8 workshop participants.

 
 
 
🦾 KPIs 
Definition of Success:
Within the 3 month project timeframe:

Launch a Global Association for Distributed Arts & Culture (GADAC) Discord server (and give it more sexy name like DisCO of Urgency) and develop a presence on social media (Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) that is supported by UWS, SoU, and the communities they work with.

 

Build up and merge the networks and organizations involved (UWS, SoU, FTR, and Distributed Ledger Technology related) to create a new, strong GADAC Community Hub and social media channel which contribute to and disseminate information on the project.

 

Public launch of the project strategy and vision of the GADAC will be presented at the Frei(t)räume conference in Berlin (27.11.2021), recorded and distributed to the GADAC Community Hub social media platforms (Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, Discord) and also via the Cardano Catalyst channels such as Youtube, Telegram, and Discord.

 

Build a communication campaign with recorded and published content from the launch at the Frei(T)räume conference to create interest and raise awareness of the new opportunities that lie within the project. One of GADAC's main goals is to close the knowledge gap between communities unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies and blockchain, by feeding accessible information into the communities.

 

Research and design a workshop program format with three different entry levels (basic, advanced, expert) to bridge the knowledge gap and guarantee low-threshold access. Execute the three workshops for each level and introduce diverse arts and cultural actors, including key members from the femminist and queer communities, to the potential of the Cardano ecosystem. Participants from each level are given the chance to choose where they want to start/enter into the program, based on their prior understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

 

Detailed documentation of workshop outcomes (Miro collaborations, Zoom recording) and upload it to Youtube so that newcomers can also access the developing body of knowledge. Content will also be distributed on the other social media channels for maximum outreach.

 

Successful onboarding of actors from the Independent Cultural Communities hub into the Cardano Catalyst Community, including Discord and the weekly Townhall.

 
 
After the Three-month project timeframe:

Stable and growing user base on the Hub's Discord server.
Maintenance and community management of the Hub's Discord server/community.
Actively strengthening connections/alliances between the GADAC Hub and Cardano Catalyst Community.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


The Cardano community is pioneering a new collaborative mindset. A new way of working together. A new way of solving vexing problems. The future has arrived, the challenge is to evenly distribute it; To paraphrase William Gibson[13].
To see opportunity and act upon it requires an entrepreneurial mindset. Entrepreneurs are everywhere. Tech Entrepreneurs, Impact Entrepreneurs, Interpenuers. They are driven by their beliefs, principles and values. They see the world from a local perspective, as it could be.
To develop the entrepreneurial mindset and turn ideas into sustainable projects and ventures, community-led hubs become places entrepreneurs can build knowledge, share information, connect, learn about and support each other. They can evenly distribute the Cardano future.
Current problems and limitations
To stay relevant and sustain their operations Local Hubs need to develop engaging programmes of events, workshops, and networking opportunities. However, as a newly emerging field that blends entrepreneurship, blockchains, token engineering, culture, governance and Cardano it is hard to find expertise to instigate, shape, host and run these events. When language and cultural barriers are factored in, reaching entrepreneurs becomes even more difficult.
Few entrepreneurs are aware of the opportunities, the technical and economic benefits or the Project Catalyst community governance of Cardano; Nor is there a full understanding of how to apply Cardano technology to micro, small and medium businesses, or startups who have the vision to scale. We need local hubs to distribute that knowledge, to make Cardano a viable option for solving market needs. The lack of available expertise restricts a hub's ability to broadcast the potential uses of Cardano's technology to the fullest. We want to change that.
The Team
The team has been responsible for entrepreneurial programme development across New Zealand. A richly diverse multicultural society of the pacific.
Jo Allum (@yojo): Entrepreneur, Communication Designer and Creative Director. Co-Founder of Venture Centre, New Zealand Open Source Society and Society for Cooperative Housing New Zealand Council Member, Co-Organises Legal Hackers NZ.
Robert O'Brien (@wolstaeb): Entrepreneur and Financial systems Software Engineer (Financial systems). Extensive Blockchain experience and co-Founded three fintech start-ups. Co-Organises LegalHackers NZ.
Pascale Hyboud-Peron: Entrepreneur, 20+ year high-school teacher, and trustee of the Global Entrepreneurship Network NZ. Co-Founder of Venture Centre. Facilitates Young Enterprise NZ, NZ Startup Weekends.
We are educators with backgrounds in finance, blockchain, legal technology, publication media, and teaching. We are co-founders and entrepreneurs and part of a team many thousand strong.
Our Solution: Co-design Canvas, Card deck & Calculator tools for hubs that are easy to explain, customise & share offline for designing blockchain ventures.
Prototype the first Cardano Business Design Canvas and associated toolkit starting with a card deck, and calculator. An engaging pack of resources that can be used at local hubs, start-up events and hackathons. These artefacts kick-start a customisable open-source set of business model co-design tools that help entrepreneurs understand and explore how to apply Cardano's technology. They create a shared community language for the greater good.
Using these resources as facilitation tools will help people understand each other and the opportunities the Cardano platform can provide them in their particular problem/solution space. They aid the process of blending worldview, information, and expertise. They focus effort on experience-based learning by providing a fun way for people to analyse, communicate, and decide.
We have extensively used the Lean Startup Canvas[1] as a facilitation artefact in hundreds of Start Weekends[2] held across New Zealand. The Cardano Business Design Toolkit is inspired by and modelled after the Platform Design Toolkit[3]. A synthesis of the Business Model Generation[4], Customer Development[5], Design Thinking[6], and Wardley Mapping[7] applied to blockchain business models. The Platform Design Toolkit is inspired by analytical tools like Lean Startup Canvas.
The initial toolkit will include three components:

Cardano Business Design Canvas: A set of co-design templates and associated guides that help facilitate team discussion and analysis of token business models.
Blockchain Economy Card Deck: A set of design patterns and methods presented as cards that prompt discussion and investigation [8].
Startup Cost Calculator: A web-based tool to help entrepreneurs budget for the costs of setting up and running a new venture [9].

Our first test deployment of the Cardano Business Design Toolkit will be in Vietnam and Indonesia! Working with the Catalyst Eastern Townhall[10] to deliver their Cardano StartUp Week in February 2022. From there we hope to iterate and refine the toolkit and translate it into more languages.
What comes next: More advanced facilitation artefacts in the future will include;

A Token Economy Simulator - easy to use web-based simulator for designing the parameters of a token economic system and its costs.
Integration of Social Simulations[11] and Games[12] into the toolkit that helps teams understand the complexity and trade-offs in the designs by playing games.

A note about challenge choice:
We have chosen the Scale-UP Cardano's Community Hubs challenge for the core work in this proposal, rather than the DLT Toolkit Challenge. Our focus with these resources is 100% on scaling community hubs as the primary customer and use. With seven years of hands-on experience building community hubs at Venture Centre, we have a deep understanding of what it takes to build these hubs and what's needed to support emerging entrepreneurs. We want to onboard the networks of hubs we already work with, and the thousands of others around the world to Sale-UP Cardano in a fast, flexible and fun way.TODO: Budget, KPIs and Additional Details to be added.
Budget
Asking for $19,500. This funds @280 hours of work @$70p/hr for both research and development, and content creation over the next 3 months (23hrs a week)
Major Tasks

Design research
Case-study interviews
Synthesis
Prototyping
Graphic design
Content writing, editing
Testing

Deliverables timeline

Month 1 - Conduct initial interviews. First draft Canvas. Document Card deck and Calculator scope/requirements.
Month 2 - Establish initial lexicon of patterns and terms for Card deck. Establish an initial chart of inputs for the calculator. Conduct 2nd interviews.
Month 3 - Design. Copy editing. Testing

What does the future look like?

Month 6 - Continue to develop the tools. Expand the project team globally. Instigate a plan for peer review and publishing of results achieved through use and dissemination of the tools through local hubs.
Month 12 - Present the project, tools and frameworks at the 2022 Cardano Summit. Begin research and development of additional tools for the toolkit.

Why is it important?
People who participate and contribute to community hubs are interested in creating ventures which provide blended social, environmental and economic returns. They just need to know how to do that on Cardano's platform and very few of them are technical people with blockchain knowledge and expertise.
How does success look like?
The average person will be able to participate in a Local Community Hub event anywhere across the world and be delighted to find a familiar frame of reference for their work. They will recognise common patterns, language and symbols and so making human connections in new communities, getting started on the earliest stages of ideation amongst a diverse group of new people and team building to create ventures on Cardano will be simpler.
Since this will be a first-of-its-kind market design resource, we plan to measure whether or not it is successful in properly instructing entrepreneurs. Instructing them in the technical and economic benefits of Cardano.
We're using our experience with similar tools in the Venture Centre with thousands of entrepreneurs over seven years. That includes many StartUp Weekends that used the LeanCanvas.
Our access to a large community of social entrepreneurs means we are able to rapidly prototype and design the ideas with our local network. We also plan to use and gain experience with the tools, in upcoming events with the Eastern Townhall and also seek to help the Catalyst School to use and provide feedback.
The most important benefit an entrepreneur walks away with is an understanding of:

Platform business and incentive models for use and distribution. (Non-Blockchain)
How platform business models are enabled by token designs. (Blockchain)
How Cardano's Native Assets, Meta-Data, and Smart-Contracts are be used to implement token fuelled platform business models. (Cardano)

From these factors, Entrepreneurs can then take the framework, create business hypotheses and map them to a set of tasks needed to test their ideas and get their venture off the ground.
Following a well-trod path, designing Canvas, Card deck and Calculator tools for use by entrepreneurs, will result in a steady increase in Cardano-curious at the top of the funnel and converting them to Cardano-community members lower down, resulting in an increase in the adoption and awareness of Cardano, a key, a continuous overarching metric of success.
Key Metrics to measure
How many new Hubs were launched in the next 6 months?

To be achieved by sharing the frameworks and tools around which Hubs can build programmes.

How many developers did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?

To be achieved by using frameworks and tools in Hub programmes that bring Tech Entrepreneurs, Impact Entrepreneurs, Interpenuers and others together.

How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?

To be achieved by creating a part of the programme/event an onboarding ritual

How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?

To be achieved by using frameworks and tools in Hub programmes that bring external organisations together (as sponsors, mentors, advisors, judges and providers on the programme/event) to work with Tech Entrepreneurs, Impact Entrepreneurs and Interpenuers.

■KPI1 : Scale up community members to 4800 from 2400.
・Why?：Now, Japan Cardano Community open chat is one of the most gently, kindle and deep understanding community. For Catalyst voting, long-term investor holder is quite important apparently to speculator. The community is quite important for increase long-term investor and step up present investor's understandings.
・WHAT? : Estimated Japanese ADA holder is more than 20000. In fact the number of the member starting Cardano open chat is 800. However, now it's increased to 2400.
■KPI２：Catalyst Voting population by Community member scale up 75 % from 50 %
・WHY？：For Catalyst voting, larger scale ADA holder such as pre-sale holder and more than 0.1 M ADA holders is quite important.
・WHAT?： The main stream to increase Catalyst voting is i) increase community members ii) increase population of Community members iii) grow up the understandings for Cardano Vision.
・HOW？： By publishing of book for Cardano vision and fundamental understanding of CRYPTO!, YOUTUBE, meetups, community moderate. This moderation also make deep understanding of Cardano and other crypto vision, these may reduce at random voting, and finally good idea will get Catalyst Funds.
■KPI３：Increasing of investor type ADA holder.
・WHY？：The increasing speculator type ADA holder does not grow up Cardano community. The long-term investors with true understanding Cardano vision is important.
・WHAT?：When the traditional investor type BTC and ETH holders convert their BTC and ETH to ADA, which make world standard model for ADA
・HOW？：By publishing of book for Cardano vision and fundamental understanding of CRYPTO!, YOUTUBE, meetups, community moderate.

TL;DR:

Offer three local educational seminars to teach people about Cardano and Catalyst with the goal of educating local people about blockchain and Cardano
Launch a community in the Salmon Nation bio-region both online (Discord) and with a physical presence for better networking and connecting with local people and getting them involved with Catalyst.
Reflect, evaluate, and iterate for greater and greater impact to drive adoption and awareness of Cardano in Salmon Nation

Detailed Plan:
This is a proposal to launch the Salmon Nation Decentralized Alliance (SANADA) as a Cardano Local Community Center for a six month trial period. During this time, we will hire a part-time community manager (20 hrs./mo) to build and create a local community center in Victoria, BC, plan and run three educational seminars which will be open to the public, start on online community on Discord for SANADA, hold weekly online meetings to bring the community together, and engage in networking and discussion with the local community to spread the word and introduce them to Cardano and Catalyst.
Setting up local community centers in the region (starting with Victoria) will give us the opportunity to connect with and recruit people to solve local problems using Cardano decentralized blockchain technologies. Opportunities exist here in the areas of focus on local governance (decentralization), Indigenous empowerment and sovereignty (decolonization), and sustainability/climate change initiatives (decarbonization). Cardano can help in those areas by creating solutions to those problems, and involving local people to address local issues will be key to creating social and economic impact in these areas.
The long term (multi-year) goals of SANADA will be to:

Teach and communicate the benefits of the Cardano ecosystem to the local community and bring them into the Catalyst community,
Act as a developer hub to educate and teach developers to create these blockchain solutions, and
Discover innovative solutions to help grow the entrepreneurial ecosystem and accelerate the creation of world changing solutions by local talent, particularly in the areas of decolonization, decentralization, and decarbonization.

Thirty-three million people share our home in this place we call Salmon Nation. It spans 9.7 million square miles of land and sea—about the size of North and Central America. From central California north to the Arctic, it includes 1.2 million square miles of land in Canada and the United States and generates between $1.2 and $1.9 trillion in economic activity each year. Salmon Nation (https://salmonnation.net/) is a multi-country bio region that extends from Alaska down to Northern California. Salmon Nation is a unique and beautiful bio-region that is home to millions of people, including Indigenous populations in both the US and Canada. From issues of Indigenous sovereignty, to re-envisioning democracy and governance, to the challenges of sustainable resource extraction, the issues and challenges of the region are many and require new ways of thinking and collaborating. Cardano brings the blockchain and smart contract solutions to help solve many of these issues with enough creativity and passion from the people on the ground trying to solve these problems.
Goals and timeline for Fund 6:
December 2021: Fund SANADA for 6 months as a trial period to launch the organization and spread the word about Cardano and build up interest and excitement about Catalyst in the local community.
December 2021: Start SANADA as a non-profit organization incorporated in Victoria, British Columbia (heart of Salmon Nation) and set up a physical presence. We will operate out of a co-working space for lower costs, have access to event space, and to increase opportunities for serendipitous networking.
December 2021: Set up our virtual online presence with a Discord server, weekly Zoom calls, and a website. We will also build an on on-line community with weekly virtual collaboration meetings.
December 2021 - February 2022: Host introductory Cardano seminars for the local community. These will start with monthly educational meetups and networking events for 3 consecutive months to raise awareness of Cardano in the local community and get them involved with Catalyst (ideally these will be in-person events, but they may need to be on-line to accommodate COVID-19 safety recommendations):

December 2021 seminar: What is Cardano and blockchain? What is Web 3.0 and decentralization?
January 2022 seminar: How to buy Cardano. Setting up your own wallet, keeping your keys secure. Staking. Sending ADA, tokens, and NFTs.
February 2022 seminar: Introduction to Project Catalyst and getting involved

Lesson materials and notes will be put up online for the community to see and use for reference, and support those that were unable to attend the seminars in person.
February 2022 - May 2022: Focus on regional community involvement in Catalyst for Fund 8+ by working with the local community and developers on ideas and potential areas where proposals can be made to solve local challenges.
During this 6 month trial period, the community manager will also reach out to existing local cryptocurrency meetups, meet with local entrepreneurs and developers, and begin to build up a regional community of change-makers, developers, and entrepreneurs to get involved with Catalyst.
We will also do deep dive retrospectives of all events and community engagement to reflect on what is working and what is not so we can iterate and improve to drive greater and greater adoption and awareness of Cardano and Catalyst in the Salmon Nation bio-region.
How will we measure success (for this Fund 6 proposal):
Building community is a key outcome measured by:

Engagement metrics on Discord
Number of people participating in the community (diversity and inclusion) over time
Number of attendees for weekly online community meetings
Number of educational seminar attendees
Number of partnering organizations and companies
Number of developers participating

Getting the local community involved with Catalyst is a key outcome measured by:

Number of people from the community participating in Catalyst voting in Fund 8
Number of people from the community participating as Catalyst community advisors in Fund 8
Number of people from the community submitting Catalyst proposals in Fund 8

About SANADA
SANADA (Salmon Nation Decentralized Alliance) (https://www.sanada.eco) is a Cardano Local Community Center founded to educate, connect, and foster the development of decentralized blockchain solutions in our local bio-region. Salmon Nation is a multi-country bio region that extends from Alaska down to Northern California. If you are new to the concept of Salmon Nation, here is a thesis that describes the movement: https://salmonnation.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Salmon-Nation-Thesis-v2-Pages-Web-v2-91520.pdf
SANADA is not an official representative of the Salmon Nation organization or Raven network. We are a collective of blockchain enthusiasts who believe in the Salmon Nation mission and hope to contribute to the body of wisdom and practices to share with the community, particularly how we can apply blockchain solutions to local and global challenges. SANADA seeks to act as a resource for software developers; connect with and educate the local community, creatives, and businesses; and raise awareness of Cardano and the power of blockchain and decentralization. We seek to solve local challenges to bring creative and sustainable solutions to the region and empower regional communities.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Built on Cardano, BoC, is currently live, running in BETA, and is already far ahead of its competitors in terms of scope, usability, and the quality of its content.
Approximately 1100 hours of work have been put into BoC over the course of the past three months to get it to its current state and we want to expand our vision of this map of the Cardano ecosystem further. This includes:
 
- Increasing the quantity and quality of listed projects week on week, including in-depth research and the writing up of informative and unbiased descriptions for each project.
- Creating a dictionary of industry specific terminologies to be coded into the terms used throughout the site. This will be done using pop-up definitions, so that when a user hover over an industry specific term e.g. AMM, mainnet, smart contract, babel fees; the definition of that term pops up, meaning they don't have to leave the page or even lose their spot in the text.
- Provide industry descriptions, written in layman's terms, across the platform to introduce the user to, and familiarize them with, the subcategories of the Cardano ecosystem.
- Integrating ""available in"" language tags into all projects and searching capabilities to facilitate the ease of finding and using tools built on Cardano in the users native tongue.
- Expanding project page designs so they are tailored to spotlight the unique features of each specific industry e.g. An NFT collection is very different from a DEX and both are very different from a developer tool. All project pages are currently uniform. We will assess each of the 13+ industries to document its specific needs and develop page formats and input forms to suit these needs.
- Currently, BoC showcases Cardano in a project-orientated fashion through a search function. This method of discovery resonates strongly with the existing Cardano community but fails to capture the imagination and attention of beginner users who are dissuaded from further exploration by an excess of foreign concepts and new terminologies. We are going to develop a fun and explorative UI funnel, ""a journey through the industries"", aimed specifically at the Cardano and crypto newcomer. This UI will consist of education materials, specific to each industry category found on BoC, that break down and explain each unique industry to the newcomer. We will utilize various media formats and the project data we've accumulated to help us simply explain even the most complex of topics found in the Cardano-verse.
- Optimizing the search and tagging functions to better organize the language of Cardano that is used to catalogue the ecosystem.
- Performing a code audit to move BoC from BETA to public and to ready the platform for the almost exponential growth of both users and the Cardano ecosystem in the coming months and years.
 
*BUDGET*
Asking for $44,000
$44,000 funds another 1100 hours of work -@ $40p/hr- for both development and content creation over the next 3 months.
 
*DELIVERABLES TIMELINE*
1 Month - The successful implementation of short and informative industry descriptions into the UI. Integrate language tags into all projects and the search function. The addition of 40+ projects and their write ups to the site.
2 Months - Creation of the dictionary of terms along with implementation into all existing projects on the site. The addition of 40+ projects and their write ups to the site. Audit of existing code completed and BoC emerging from BETA.
3 Months - Creation and implementation of the UI funnel ""a journey through the industries"". The addition of 40+ projects and their write ups to the site.
 
*DEFINITIONS OF SUCCESS*
Through all of the below a steady increase in site visits, resulting in an increase in the adoption and awareness of Cardano, is a key and continuous metric of success.
3 Months
Becoming a developers go-to source for discovering the tools they will use to develop their ideas on top of the Cardano blockchain.
6 Months
Use of BoC as a referenceable resource by community hubs around the world. Discussions of translating the static educational content into various languages.
12 Months
Continue to maintain an up-to-date education system, library of projects, and level playing field for project discovery in the Cardano ecosystem. This means not having to succumb to financial pressure from advertisers or others attempting to manipulate our morals and steer the platform away from its pure purpose of education and discovery for their own individual gains.
 
*WHY DO WE NEED BUILT ON CARDANO?*
Many consumers (51% in some surveys) are currently investing in cryptocurrencies with get-rich-quick ideas and no knowledge of the cypherpunk and societal democratization ideals underlying their inception and proliferation. This gap between this reality and the dream state of indoctrinating more members of the public to become involved in the projects being built on blockchains exists for two reasons:
1. The media-fueled, speculative-asset perspective of cryptocurrencies projected toward members of the general public.
2. The time-consuming learning process required to become involved with any crypto project on more than a speculative investment level.
If one aspires to learn more and chooses to dive down the proverbial rabbit hole to explore the crypto-world below this superficial level they find a world full of highly fragmented, unorganized content and information. This content is often driven by ulterior motives -subscribers, stakes, and views- whilst content creators and investment returns regularly take center stage; with the information filling only a formal and auxiliary station.
Such content is not conducive to fostering further engagement with blockchain platforms, and it's fragmented nature doesn't give the newbie a cohesive path to a place where they can seek concrete knowledge of this foreign world and the concepts it puts forth; thus deterring them from exploring further, becoming an involved member of the space and, potentially, an advocate for the underlying ideals noted in the first paragraph.
Currently, when introducing others to the crypto-verse, those in-the-know will inform those who want-to-know by talking to them, by explaining ""it"" to them and telling them what it ""is"". They may show them a website or two -of either specific projects or a blockchain encompassing website like the Cardano Foundation- and then direct them to some select Youtube videos. But what do these closed-loop websites actually tell the reader? and, more importantly, where do they guide themselves thereafter?
The same goes for Youtube videos, except that the person behind the video may have an ulterior motive shaping their words; and, in a way, you can say projects' homepages do too. After this, then what? If our protagonist, armed with their iotas of new knowledge, is still willing to cast themself adrift into the oceans in front of them, where are they to steer their ship? There is no map to guide them. There is no tool to help them feel their way through the world of Cardano.
If only our in-the-know facilitator of this story could direct their, often tentatively eager, want-to-know amigo to an easily navigable map of the ecosystem? This map is our vision. This map doesn't only provide an overview of the whole, and often intimidatingly large, ecosystem that stretches out before the reader, it also contains smaller, sub-maps, to which an explorer can turn when they want to delve deeper into a certain element of the ecosystem; be that the canyon of DEXs or the sea of NFTs. Each of these maps comes with a legend, informing our new traveller of the meanings of all the strange acronyms and terminologies they find littering the maps of the ecosystem they're exploring.
As a community managed, ecosystem-growth-orientated platform Project Catalyst is yet to develop an information hub aimed at those looking to expose themselves to the possibilities of Cardano and educate themselves to a level where they can feel confident in participating; be that as a user of a dApp or blockchain based service, or by adding their voice to the community.
Fostering engagement, in any and all crypto-spheres, is most often done through encouraging the self-education of the under-informed by making them fumble blindly across uncharted territory; a world full of acronyms and technological terminology that can terminally bog the explorer down, stifling their desire to continue.
Unfortunately, this is a poor way of improving the conversion rate of ""interested member of the public"" into ""informed user"".
In order to help drive the awareness and adoption rates of Cardano around the world there is a need for a uniform hub of up-to-date, informative content that is displayed in a neutral way and written in un-intimidating layman's terms without a bias. A ""central"" hub of written information like this can provide the citizens of the world with access to a uniform and easily navigable resource.
We have already started building it: builtoncardano.com

Introduce the Cardano Community to homeless communities in Manchester, UK, through in-person workshops and online sessions.",21,"Sunday, 22 August 2021 21:34",Stephen Whitenstall,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Stephen-Whitenstall/3073558-48088,Vanessa Cardui,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Vanessa-Cardui/3093022-48088,18980,Requested funds in USD,"

Impact - How we address the challenge question
This proposal will initiate a 6-month experiment in communication and understanding between the Cardano community, and homeless communities in Manchester, UK.
Homeless people in the UK come from a diverse mix of different social backgrounds, cultures, languages, and migration status; but due to their homelessness, they form a distinct and cohesive community, with a culture of its own. This culture includes lived experience of exclusion, poverty and marginalisation; and also, a tendency towards mutual aid, because homeless people have to develop networks of mutual support between themselves in order to survive. As a result, ""homeless culture"" often has a perspective on questions of value and contribution that is unique and vital. We believe this perspective could enrich the Cardano community; and in turn, Cardano could empower homeless people. By inviting homeless people to engage with Cardano from where they are, using the perspective of their community and its culture, and by using facilitators who have their own lived experience of homelessness, we are addressing the challenge's key focus on enabling people to bring their own cultural understanding to Cardano.  ""Cultural understanding"" is not only about the culture of a particular country or language – it can also be about shared experience.
The people we will reach are unlikely to have any blockchain expertise, although they may have some tech skills. So we are addressing the challenge's aim of driving adoption at ground level, by people who do not already have blockchain expertise. And because the UK homeless community includes a mix of migrant people and UK-born people, and a wide range of levels of ability in English, our project also addresses the challenge's aim of enabling people to take part in their own language; our budget includes money for interpretation/translation where needed, and we plan to pay people from within the community itself as interpreters, and to encourage participants to work in their first language if they wish.
The first step in empowering any community to change their lives is to create a space where people can develop and crystallise their OWN understanding of the problem. This might be called community ""problem-sensing"". By making space for this, our project meets the challenge of empowering people to change their lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What the Homeless Hub will do
1. Problem-Sensing Workshops
A series of 15 weekly workshops will be held with homeless communities in Manchester, UK, working in association with local grassroots homeless organisations that the proposal team have existing links with.
These workshops will explore questions of value, worth, contribution, power, governance and participation through the lens of lived experience of homelessness, and will allow time and space for participants to define and articulate problems, and research whether these problems could be addressed using blockchain technology.
Sessions will be documented, and key questions and perspectives that arise in sessions will be fed back to the Cardano community through its various channels (e.g. Discord; Telegram; the Town Hall; social media), thus opening dialogue between the homeless community and the Cardano community.
 
2. Building a community hub
These initial workshops will build confidence, and shared understanding, to enable the group of homeless people to lead a community hub.
This hub will have its roots in the homeless community, but might also engage others locally. We envisage it leading to a public event where homeless people can tell non-homeless locals about blockchain technology and its implications for all of our empowerment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our measures of success
at 3 months (end of January 2022)

3 organisations working with homeless people onboarded. At least 10 participants engaged, and sessions are in progress.
Initial baseline evaluation done with participants – what did they know about blockchain before the project?
Participants feel welcomed in the sessions, know that their contribution is valued, and are enjoying taking part.
Participants report increased awareness of blockchain technology, increased confidence in expressing ideas about it.
Participants are beginning to take ownership, and shape the project towards the things that interest them.
We (facilitators and participants) are regularly sharing short insights from the sessions, via social media, Catalyst sessions, Town Hall, etc; and opening channels of communication and dialogue between Cardano and the project participants.

A mid-term evaluation will ask participants whether all this is happening. (If it's not, project team and participants will look at how to fix it.)
at 6 months (end of April 2022)

All 15 sessions delivered. Sessions have been a homeless-led space, where people could think and talk about ideas around value, worth, contribution, power, governance and participation in a way that centres their experience and perspectives.
A final project output or launch has been developed by participants, marketed widely, and delivered. This could be an event engaging the wider public, or something more internal to the homeless community, depending on what participants want to do.
During project delivery, we have found meaningful ways to create a 2-way dialogue between participants and Cardano, and to share with Cardano the insights emerging from the sessions, giving homeless people a voice in Cardano's thinking on how to engage communities. Or, if we've identified barriers to this, we have looked together at how to address those barriers.
The project has focused on the strengths and skills of the homeless community, not purely on its problems. Also, participants have been able to take part as *people*, and have not focused solely on homelessness issues if they didn't want to.
Any barriers to ongoing participation have been clearly identified, and possible solutions discussed with participants.
Participants have been publicly credited, in whatever ways they choose, for all their contributions to the project.

at 12 months (end of Nov 2022; i.e. after end of project)

The project team will write a report, documenting best practice and learning-points from the project, and will share it with participants, homeless organisations in the UK and worldwide, and Cardano.
The experiences of the project will add to ongoing conversations within Cardano about how to onboard people ""on the ground"" in communities around the world, and how to create mechanisms for effective dialogue between Cardano and communities.
12 months on, Homeless Hub might not continue in its original form (i.e. running regular weekly sessions) – but we aim for it be able to demonstrate some kind of legacy. This could include ongoing personal contacts and networking between project particpants and Catalyst (or individuals within Catalyst); ongoing links with organisations who work with homeless people, both in Manchester and more widely; increased awareness of Cardano in the homeless community; and ideally, the project team mentoring project participants to develop a proposal for Fund 8 or 9 which is led and devised by the homeless community themselves.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected public launch date
The project will be launched to the homeless community in late November/early December 2021.
The public launch date will be in April 2022, as part of the project's final output or event.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key potential risks, and how we will mitigate them


COVID issues (e.g. if there is a further UK lockdown) might make indoor, face-to-face group sessions impossible. This currently seems unlikely to happen in the UK after October; but if it does, we will mitigate by delivering via a combination of remote methods (e.g. video, online discussion), one-to-one meetings, and outdoor/walking group sessions as we move into Spring.


Participant dropout rates can be high with this community; often because projects are too inflexible, and do not understand the barriers to participation that homeless people face. We will mitigate by building group cohesion gradually (for example, structuring the early sessions so each one is self-contained and people don't have to attend them all); by offering expenses to enable participants to attend; and by offering ways that participants can contribute remotely if they miss a session, or even keep in touch with the project remotely if they need to drop out altogether. We'll also engage the help of our partner homelessness organisations, to encourage and support participants; and we'll initially recruit more participants than our minimum, to allow for some dropping-out.


Slight risk that media myths about the ""crypto boom"" might give participants unrealistic expectations of what the project can offer. We will mitigate this with clear information from the outset about what the project will offer; and by enabling participants to find out about blockchain, discuss the issues, and counter the myths.


Risks around sustaining the energy after the end of the funded project. We will mitigate this by our focus throughout on empowering participants to take ownership, so that when funding ends, participants have the tools to continue for themselves. We will also ensure that participants, and the staff of the homeless organisations we are working with, know how to stay connected with Cardano and with Catalyst after the end of the project, and that participants particularly have support to do so and are welcomed. We also aim, after the end of the project, to mentor participants to create their own homeless-led proposal for fund 8 or 9.

She is inspired by her own lived experience of homelessness as a young woman; and has developed and led a range of groundbreaking publicly-funded community engagement projects in the UK, working with marginalised communities such as homeless people, Gypsies and Travellers, refugees and asylum seekers, migrants, and working-class urban communities. She has managed successful partnerships between these communities and third-sector organisations, to address issues such as digital inclusion, creative placemaking, and access to public space and resources. She is committed to amplifying the voices of marginalised people, and working in ways that centre their experiences and empower them to build their own solutions. A key focus of her practice is the idea of the Archive in marginalised communities – how those with experience of social exclusion decide which objects they value, and preserve them for posterity outside of professional museums. For example, see The National Archives Of The Republic Of The Homeless, a 2019 project with homeless and ex-homeless artists in Hull, England: https://homeless.omeka.net
 
Homeless Hub is a project of QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) an ongoing open source project that provides support for the Cardano Project Catalyst Community. Homeless Hub's project documentation will follow  QA-DAO ideals of open-source transparency and auditability.

How this proposal will impact the challenge metrics
How many new Hubs were launched in the next 6 months?
Our proposal will set up one new hub.
How many new users of Cardano were onboarded?
The project will directly reach 10 participants from the homeless community, who will be onboarded into Cardano. Additionally, the project will attract wider attention, and we aim to onboard 5 additional people, both from the non-homeless local community where we are working, and among the staff of organisations working with homeless people in the UK.
What was the total reach of the Hub's initial marketing launch?
Initially we will be working with a core group of homeless participants to build capacity, and the Hub will not be fully public. We aim for 30 people (both homeless people, and staff working in homeless organisations) to become aware of the project, and of these, 10 homeless people will form the core project participants. The public marketing launch, to market and promote the project's outcome event in April, will happen later in the project; we aim to reach c. 1,000 people with our marketing, via social media, live publicity materials distributed locally, and word-of-mouth.
How many external organizations did this community-focused challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?
The project will draw its participants from 3 organisations working with homeless people in Manchester, UK, so these organisations will therefore be aware of the Cardano ecosystem. During the course of the project, we aim to conduct outreach to 3 additional community organisations in the local area (such as tenants' groups, parents' groups, etc), and bring them into the Cardano ecosystem via social media engagement with our project, raised awareness of Cardano, and offering the opportunity to join Catalyst workshops and events such as Town Halls.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Main Deliverable:

Educate and onboard 100 policy makers and government officials  in Ghana and Democratic Republic Of Congo (DRC) to facilitate local Cardano/DLT knowledge and use case adoption

----------IMPACT-----------
How does the proposal fit into this challenge?

Unfavorable government policies hamper blockchain adoption at the grassroot level. Creating a favorable blockchain policy climate ensures thriving local Cardano Community hubs 

How will this campaign add value to our ecosystem?

The 'Scam' narrative in many African countries has lead to wholesale bans of cryptocurrencies and blockchain due to limited understanding of DLT usage and value.
Ensuring that Cardano adoption is driven at the ground level without fear of government reprisals, will empower people to change their lives, create ownership and expand Cardano market

---------FEASIBILITY-------
Reference & Past Successes:

DRC and Ghana teams have connections to high level government and academic policy influencers 
In August WADA completed a widely successful virtual and in-person Proposer outreach program event, significantly increasing our visibility as the go-to for mentoring and onboarding new developers and entrepreneurs from Africa and diaspora. https://twitter.com/jaycidiq/status/1432106218923888640
8 unique-country Africa and diaspora hubs with expanding teams ensures local macro-level awareness, sensitivity and shared learnings. 2 of these will host these high profile events 
A membership platform in development for onboarding, interaction and virtual training sessions
Mentors and experts willing to support both the goals of WADA and Cardano

Roadmap:
Launch Date: Q1 2022
1-3 months Post Project Approval

Identify local collaborators, official guest list and speakers for each event

4-6 months:

Organize One in person event each in Ghana and DRC aimed at high level government and academic officials

6months -1 year

Onboard to WADA membership platform and engage attendees in local hubs and Cardano ecosystem as appropriate

Team & Roles:

Afia: Ghana Country Lead @WADA https://www.linkedin.com/in/afia-asamoa-04911816/

Budget: 7k x 2 = $14,000

Team Costs and Coordination: 3k x2
Marketing Venue Publicity: 3K x2
Speaker Incentives: 1k x2

Risk Management:

Ongoing local Covid 19 protocols could be an issue with in person events. This will be closely monitored for event date modification as necessary
Follow-up of event attendees will be prioritized to ensure event gains don't dissipate over time

----------AUDITABILITY-----------
What success looks like:

Policy makers have a more favorable  view of Cardano as an example of positive DLT use and Local Community hubs  are able to offer the average person participation in their own language and with their own cultural understanding

Key Metrics:

No of event attendees
No. of new users of Cardano measured by Yoroi or Daedalus download
Follow-up questions and engagement
Number of attendees onboarded into WADA membership platform

I N T R O D U C T IO N
Members of the  Cardano community are creatives, doers and visionaries. They don't want to just show up they want to make a difference. We cannot nurture and grow the communities if they are held back by an unnecessary digital divide that separates technology experts from non-tech visionaries. 
Everyday I meet creative people eager to roll up their sleeves and write application on Cardano but they are blocked because they are not programmers or engineers.
Let's introduce  build communities around the ideas of Citizen Development and No-Code Hackathons. 

C I T I Z E N  D E V E L O P M E N T
Citizen Developers are are people with little to no knowledge of programming who build software using No-Code platforms like QModeler. The advent of No-Code has created a sea change in the way software is developed by allowing Citizen Developers to build software and communities to work collaboratively to create software solutions to problems. Citizen Developer is a new term to describe someone who is participating in building software products despite having little or no technical knowledge.The growth of Citizen development is estimated to be 30% per year will overtake programming development in the next 3 years.
N O  C O D E  H AC K A T H O N S
No-Code hackathons are long running events, 3-6 month or even longer, that brings people of all backgrounds together together around the task of creating software to solve a problem. We hope to soon use No-Code hackathons to include Plutus smart contracts using QModeler. Follow the progress of no-code hackathons at https://www.cardanonocode.com
 
W H O  W E  A R E
We believe technology should unite and not divide us. We strive to democratize technology by simplifying it so that innovation happens across all strata of society. Our vision will be realized when any sized company, from enterprise to a small business owner, or even a single person with a yen to create, can innovate solutions to their problems. Ferdon - the maker of Qmodeler is its located in Vietnam. QModeler is a supporter of the Vietnam National Computer Olympic Team where many of our team members of competed.
Ferdon is a company of currently 20 people passionate about democratizing technology. Ferdon has been working 3 and a half years to build our flagship product, QModeler, one of the first no-code platforms and the first no-code platform for blockchain. QModeler is capable of synthesizing models into smart contracts.
Ferdon is launching the first of its kind, no-code hackathons, long running events that bring together communities to solve pressing issues using No-Code tools.
Ferdon's active projects include

In collaboration with WADA we have launched a first of its kind no-code hackathon to develop a solution for food safety traceability in Africa.
Launching a no-code hackathon in Vietnam to develop a solution to food traceability in Vietnam.

More and more people are joining Cardano blockchain and we still want to grow even further.
But for achieving that we need to protect what we already have! 
First of all, we are creating multiple mailing lists (in different languages) where we announce people on ongoing scams (here people will have to report it). In addition we will have an website where the scams are announced.
Secondly, we create a short video (max 30s) that will be used for ads on youtube and given to Cardano and IOHK officials to be used. The video will represent the social media verifiable signature and other videos without this ""intro"" should be considered as scam potentials. 
The video should just tell that Cardano or the IOHK officials don't give money for free in anyway (here should be said nicer than this).  In this way if the scammers want to use the video will just make no sense because will contradict the rest of the scam.
Lastly, create groups to sign petitions to ban/block bad actors.
The solution is not perfect, but at least it may save some people getting scammed.
 
30h video making x 100$/h = 3000$
Ads campaign budget 12 months x 1000$/month = 12000$
Website to verify scammers = 2000$
Mailing list tools + maintenance = 1000$
 Subtitle text translation 50$/h x 100 languages = 5000$

Fund A Cardano Hub in Buenos Aires. Host Spanish language events and provide educational workshops, delivered by local community members.",8,"Friday, 20 August 2021 20:13",Bitcoin Bay,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Bitcoin-Bay/3100270-48088,,,9500,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We are Bitcoin Bay, a cryptocurrency community originally from Toronto, but also organize meetup communities around the world. 
 
Summary
We propose the founding of a new Cardano Community Hub in Buenos Aires. This will be its own independent organization, but gain the support of Bitcoin Bay and other Cardano communities. 
The Buenos Aires hub will host bi-weekly Spanish language events, including community gatherings and educational workshops. At first these may be online events due to pandemic restrictions, but they will become in-person as soon as restrictions are lifted. Our contacts in Buenos Aires will be able to host them in person, given some incentive. 
In addition we will create local community whatsapp and telegram groups to enable community members to stay in touch. (Whatsapp is popular in Argentina). 
We are looking for suggestions on how to connect this hub with the wider Cardano Community. 
 
Budget
$3000 - Meetup Logistics, Venue costs, food etc. 
$4500 - Salary for local event organizers and workshop givers
$2000 - ADA airdrops for the Buenos Aires community
Goals
- Introduce new users to cardano
- Provide a space for Cardano enthusiasts to find each other
- connect Buenos Aires Talent to Cardano Community (especially  developer)
- provide quality educational workshops
- Drive adoption of Cardano apps 
- provide on the ground fact finding, how is Cardano actually being used? 
- Hold 26 successful events in 1 year's time. 
 
What success looks like
0-3 months
- Hold bi-weekly events, growing to 30+ people per event
- Create 15 new Cardano holders per event 
3-6 months
- Hold bi-weekly events, growing to 60+ people per event
- Create 30 new Cardano holders per event
- Secure additional sponsorship
6-12 months
- Hold bi-weekly events, growing to 100+ people per event
- Create 50 new Cardano holders per event
- Secure additional sponsorship
- With enough funding, secure a permanent physical location for the hub
 
We aim to host 26 successful events in 1 year's time. Following that, the success of the hub may depend on additional sponsorship.

※If something changes,they are summarized in the following documents.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jo8zOO0FjBooAyfs0GaCy6fbxf2cEdWoUiToZelsCY/edit?usp=sharing
【Problem-Detali】
Few companies are aware that blockchain will revolutionize industries and infrastructure. The reason for this is that there are still few actual examples and it lacks persuasiveness, and it is difficult for active Cardano-related information to reach outside the community.
 
【Solusion-Detali】
We will exhibit at the Blockchain Expo, one of the largest business events in Japan, and introduce Cardano to companies and public organizations that visit the event to make them recognize and remember Cardano. To do this, we will make full use of the drawing power of Charles' speech in this event and the spreading power of the powerful Japanese community to create excitement even before the event and make it the most active exhibition booth.
Ultimately desired result:-JP companies recognize Cardano as main BLOCKCHAIN! The problem is that few companies recognize that blockchain will revolutionize industries and infrastructure.
 
【Experience-Detali】
Got and shared Cardano and blockchain-related information on social networking sites on a daily basis for over two years, reaching approximately 1,000 people. Has been contributing translated articles for a year as an ambassador and recently became an SPO with the support of the community.

We provide one main platform for every translator-hub, that we have one collaboration standard among our whole ecosystem.",27,"Thursday, 19 August 2021 20:25",Jonny Mai,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Jonny-Mai/3094645-48088,Rik,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Rik/3069291-48088,4000,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Our Main Focus:
""Create a collaboration platform as bridge between local Translation-Hubs""
This project in a nutshell:

Make it easier to work international
Build a Bridge between local Hubs and Projects
Attract new engaged members
Provide an platform, that local hubs can focus on their community

 
The main problem:
Only 9%* of the world speaks English = Cardano can't reach the unbanked!     *English as their first or second language
We need to give people the chance to understand Cardano in their own language.
 
Our work:
We already translate the weekly Catalyst Town-hall meeting into German and French, reaching about 40% more people. And we've already developed the CTS_Community collaboration platform: www.project-cts.org
 
Collaboration:
This translator platform is part of a larger global translating project ""blockchaintranslation.io"" which includes 3 major pillars:

commercial platform - Safety in Numbers (Fund5 and Fund6)
https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/BLOCKCHAINTRANSLATION-IO/369707-48088
translator platform - Project CTS (Fund6)
news platform (Fund7)

 
Our project:
We are already well-known translators in the cardano and ProjectCatalyst community. We see that there are already local Translation-hubs out there. People speak with each other, collaborate, make projects and create cool content. We dont want to create even more hubs, we want to build an bridge between these hubs. We all united by our love to the cardano ecosystem and we are only divided by our languages. So we should support the translators, because they are the bridge that we need.
We already build up an collaboration-platform, where every one can work with each other. We give them the opportunity to create projects on their own or with others. They also can join projects that are already running. Every work, every data, every thing that you have done is in one main place - on this collaboration platform. The best is, you only need this one platform, this one account, to work with ever project that it part of our network.
Now you ask ""Why one central platform and why an platform at all?""
Decentralization is great sure, but the decentralized hubs need to work with each other. We live in an global world, where only the language divide us as people. If we dont connect every hub on one platform they isolate themself. These Hubs are in the end only local groups of friends. Every Hub have their own tools, have their own apps and so on. Someone is using Google, another maybe Slack, and also other maybe have an own App. In the end they dont can work together. We provide one platform for every Hub, every project that they can focus on their local community. The best thing here is, that the software for this collaboration platform is open-source.
For the Translators, the bridge between every hub, this have one big advantage: They just have one translator account and can work for every project that is part of this network. And because every data is connected with this platform, they dont translate twice or create content twice. Finaly our best thing is that with this platform, we enable second layer translations. In the moment there are just Translators from ENG to their local language. With this platform, we could also onboard Translators from for Example Russian into Chinese.
We are not an business - We are part of the community. We dont take money - If you fund us, you fund the community.
Why a new collaboration platform?
Yes, we know that there are Discord, Telegram, Google Forms, Google Meet and so on out there. But imagine one place where you can have all of this. One place where you chat, create forms, make meetings and store data. Imagine you just need 1 App for this, imagine you could chat and call people who doesn't have these Apps.
You dont need to imagine it, we have made it: The ProjectCTS - collaboration platform.
It is one tool for every need. This is time efficient and could safe toolmakers and translators many time.
 
Security of the platform and the data-sytem
Our platform is secured under the highest industrial standards and is certified with the ISO/IEC 27001:2013. To ensure that no data is getting lost, there will be made several backups daily and to avoid attacks the server are behind multiple firewalls and there were setted up geo-redundant. In the dialog with our hosting provider we already defend over 20 deep attacks on our server.
 
Our roadmap:
Starting Point:
We already startet the platform in August 2021
In the next 3-6 months:

We maintain the collaboration tool.
We invite Toolmakers, Translators and also funded project to onboard on our tool.
We invite parts of the ProjectCatalyst team to onboard on our platform.

Further steps:

Invite more people to onboard
Scale-Up the platform for more users
Invite parts of the cardano team (IOG and the foundation) to onboard

 
Our financial plan:
Q: Why is the financial plan calculated over 12months?
A: The cheapest payment method for hosting are anually. So somehow we are a little bit cheaper
over the long term to calculate from year to year insted of months.
website-hosting and security:
19€ per month apx. 23$
23$ * 12months = 276 USD
**website coding and design:**699 USD once
commercial and presentations:
109,99 per year apx. 130 USD
collaboration plattform:
  45€ per month - Plattform
+ 2€ per month - Domain
+ 3€ per month - Security
SUM = 50€ per month apx. 60 USD
60$ * 12months = 720 USD
legal:
30€ per month apx. 35$
35$ * 12months = 420 USD
maintaining-Team:
60€ per month apx. 71$
71$ * 12months * 2admins = 1704 USD
 
Financial Reserve:
4,000 $ requested - 3,949$ sum of all above = 51 USD
Requested Fund: 4,000 USD
 
Success and measurement-metrics:
Success after 3 months:
finished to onboard 10 language-hubs
finished to onboard 3 projects
translated the website into 3 languages
 
Success after 6 months:
finished to onboard 20 language-hubs
finished to onboard 10 projects
supported at least 3 projects to translate them and reaching out more users
 
Success after 12 months:
finished to onboard 30 language-hubs
finished to onboard 20 projects
supported at least 7 projects to translate them and reaching out more users
 
*1 language-hub is counted as one unique language with more than 1 translators - this goal is regarding to the challenge metric ""How many new Hubs were launched in the next 6 months?""
1 project is counted as one unique group of developer or an organization who want to develop something for or with the cardano-ecosystem - this goal is regarding to the challenge metric ""How many developers did this community-focused challenge bring into the cardano ecosystem?"" and also ""How many external organizations did this community-focus challenge bring into the Cardano ecosystem?""
 
""supported at least 1 project"" is counted, that one of the projects (definition is mentioned above) already could increase their own success and outreach by participating in our translation-network. The additional outreach to an new language can be counted and could fit into challenge metric, but here we are not sure which one.*

FundTrack is a modern-day, forward looking tool to facilitate timely project accounting, 3increase transparency, aid in decision-making and document the procurement and supply chain process as it happens. Especially tuned to the
charitably-funded international project environment. Where sponsors, separated by large distances from implementing partners, do not have active control of the project spending process.
The Cardano platform, and all of its components, properly harnessed and configured, offer opportunities for large and small organizations operating on the edge to simplify data collection and facilitate timely Project Accounting & Reporting. 
Creating a new, dynamic, data-driven dimension of Monitoring and Evaluation, the tool used by almost every UN agency, donors and sponsoring agencies. This ""tip-of-the-spear"" use of Cardano aimed at improving the Project Environment - will lead to many other applications across the spectrum of UN 17 SDG goals, in countries throughout the developing world.
 
FundTrack operates within the same time-tested budgeting, project accounting, procurement and supply chain management processes, familiar to all organizations. But brings those processes into the 21st century. Building on Shelly, Goguen, Marlowe, Basho, Voltaire, Atala, Yoroi and, in part, on the concept of ""Ricardian Contracts"".4
FundTrack design capitalizes on today's (and considers tomorrow's) telecoms' networks, widespread coverage of terrestrial & satellite-based internet service56, penetration levels of affordable smartphones, and Cardano blockchain protocols.
 
FundTrack harnesses features and capabilities of the whole of the blockchain-based Cardano Ecosystem built into
Alonzo (smart contracts)
Marlowe (Plutus Domain Specific Language for financial transactions)
Atala (permissioned networks, identity, payments, supply chain management)
Yoroi Mobile Application.
 
Whilst FundTrack appears to be aimed at Project Accounting, its value rests on access to the documents which underlie the cost data. Being able to see a ""proposed"" transaction that ""somehow does not look right' before funds have been spent, gives the opportunity to exercise control. Perhaps just to ask for an explanation or more detail before approving. Sponsors never get that opportunity in typical grant management processes. (See graphic attached).
The UN uses a centralised SAP Enterprise Resource Program, ""Umoja"". It is based on the ""End to End: Partner Life Cycle (See Graphic attached).
Anyone who has experience with ERP systems knows that change is a really big deal. Not to mention cost. FundTrack works at the bottom end of the food chain – where people and companies lack the resources (human and financial) to interface with a SAP enterprise resource system. The temporary nature of a project-based service provider (Implementing Partners) makes the economic equation to gather those skills unworkable, for all but the very largest organizations.
Conceptually, the Umoja approach is quite similar to FundTrack. So that is half of the battle won. The UN recognizes the benefit of trying to harmonize implementing partner processes. However, the cost and effort to get all levels of Implementing Partners able to use SAP, will be prohibitive – in every dimension. Whereas FundTrack focuses on simplicity and user experience. (Later discussed as human-centered design). The Revolut inspiration is quite relevant to FundTrack usability and adoption, a demonstration there is no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to effective ""killer-app"" UX .
 
FundTrack is a tool for all kinds of development projects. Useful across the entire range of the UN 17 SDG. It can serve institutions, large non profits, government agencies and non governmental organizations, companies and consultants.

A project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time, and therefore defined scope and resources.
And a project is unique in that it is not a routine operation, but a specific set of operations designed to accomplish a singular goal. 
So a project team often includes people who don't usually work together – sometimes from different organizations and across multiple geographies.

  FundTrack focuses on the most under-served segment at Phase 4 of this PMP: 'Effort and Cost Tracking.'(See Project Management Professional explanation attached.
 While Effort and Cost Tracking might seem to be a small part of improving outcomes, it is actually critical to achieving the UN Secretary general's commitment to data-driven transformation. For, Effort and Cost Tracking is the only place in the process where problems can be identified and prevented. If the data is not available to the Program managers sitting far away from the work, in a timely manner, decision-making is always condemned to being too little, too late – after the fact.
 
Traditionally, Monitoring & Evaluation programs leave Effort and Cost Tracking to the purview of Implementing Partners. The one party in the equation that has the least incentive to report mistakes, problems, missteps, or in worst cases, fraud, waste or abuse. Suspect expenses, easily hidden, can be reported as ""net costs"" in reports - obscuring problems completely, or at least until too late to avoid.
FundTrack enables

Authorizing expenditures according to the Project Budget.
Revealing changes in the Project Plan, as they arise, via the procurement process.
Providing local implementing partners with a standard project accounting system, while they continue to manage
their own financial accounting system.

UN SDG Projects are Large and Small
FundTract is designed to work for two levels of Projects. For example: Infrastructure and Sustainable cities (Goals 9 & 11) probably involve large complex multi-year projects - operating with sophisticated project controls and qualified financial and administrative staff.
Projects in other sectors like Education or Water (Goals 4,6) or Forests (Goal 15) may involve a series of or combination of smaller, short term projects, scattered over wide geographic areas, executed by several small Micro-Small-Medium Sized
Enterprises (Goal 9 – MSMSEs) each managing work with unsophisticated financial accounting systems (not using Project Accounting Systems) and a small financial and administrative support staff.
 
CIPFA \ THE CHARTERED INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC FINANCE AND ACCOUNTANCY published a report by The Intl Financial Reporting For Non Profit Organisations that says: 
""The preparation of financial statements is crucial for accountability and decision-making and for trust and confidence in NPOs.""
""NPO stakeholders need financial reporting information that shows whether an NPO is achieving its objectives in a way that maximises economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources, while complying with restrictions and regulations, in the context of its longer-term financial health.""
 
Sponsors Rely on Monitoring and Evaluation Teams
Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) activities are the main tools used to increase the likelihood of achieving Program and Policy objectives - Outcomes and Impact.
""Monitoring is the systematic process of collecting, analyzing and using information to track a programme's progress toward reaching its objectives and to guide management decisions. Monitoring usually focuses on processes, such as when and where activities occur, who delivers them and how many people or entities they reach.""
""Evaluation aims at determining the relevance, impact, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of interventions and the contributions of the intervention to the results achieved. 9(Adapted from Gage and Dunn 2009, Frankel and Gage 2007, and PATH Monitoring and Evaluation Initiative)""
 
However, in neither mode does the M&E team get deeply involved, on a continuing basis throughout the project life cycle in project accounting, procurement processes, supply chain management or project documentation. At best, they discover problems or weaknesses after the fact.
M&E is useful to identify Outcomes and Impact, but not as useful in achieving efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation, especially Use of Funds.
Traditional mechanisms and systems, at their hearts, are founded in the pre-digitized world. Relying on personal interventions (field based Monitoring and Evaluation), after action reports, and lessons learned - codified in digital copies of paper documents. They do not capitalize on the extensive penetration of mobile communications and smartphones with cameras and mobile apps, in and around the edges of the developing world.

""Audit via DAO"" is an attempt to increase community engagement into Catalyst and to make audit like Decentralized Autonomous Organization. 
There are many winners of Project Catalyst and there will be more. Some of these projects will really to develop Cardano ecosystem, but with such amount of projects it's easy to be lost. There are of course reports and Catalyst team work actively, and as we have this category to ""Improve and Grow Auditability"" I'm suggesting to do it with the help of community.
Yes, there are professional auditors, community audits will differ in a way that we don't give strict rules to all the auditors. DAO auditors can select a project where he or she can have bigger competence, and do audit by reading a proposal, tracking results and speaking with companies and individuals who work on this particular proposal.  
For example with a budget of $8000 and the fixed price ($40 per audit) we will have 200 community audits. 
Of course, somebody can say it's a small amount, but we here in Project Catalyst do a lot of work for free) So I think $40 in ADA is a normal reward per audit (but of course looking forward to hear your thoughts) 
Who will do these audits? You! 
It can be 20 people who do 10 audits each, or it can be 40 people who will do 5 audits each.
All this is up to the community to decide
We'll create a new site for these audits, and will also publish this information on crypto-blogs, therefore also increasing general awareness about Cardano ecosystem and which projects emerge.
$888 of budget will be organizational cost (for project manager's work, web-site hosting, domain, transaction fees, etc.). In the beginning I will hold managerial role, but in the future I hope there will be enough instruments to do it by DAO
I'm sure that this can bring more people's awareness to the project Catalyst, more transparency, and more ADA usage. Hopefully, if supported - this proposal will give the opportunity to earn ADA to all the active memebers. 
This might look like experiment, but the Project Catalyst is an experiment too)

SCAT DAO is a new audit paradigm that reinvents the way audits are selected, performed, and financed. With SCAT DAO we solve audits inherent problem, the conflict of interest that comes from paying for an audit service. As we have seen with Enron, Tyco, and countless others, the possibility always exists for an auditor to commit fraud to keep their client happy. With SCAT DAO, the token holders choose the projects they care for and want audited. The audit process is standardized, automated, and performed by the community with all services funded by the DAO's treasury. SCAT DAO auditors are incentivized only to provide accurate audit results, regardless of if they are good or bad. No more altering or softening results to appease clients, no more worrying about what the client will think. We are the client, we are the auditor, we are SCAT DAO.
With our funding received from R5, we are currently in the process of developing our work program to audit the various dapps and projects that will be coming to the Cardano ecosystem. As part of this initiative, we will also be onboarding a work force of part time auditors who will perform audit procedures on behalf of the DAO. We believe there are direct synergies between this project already in progress and the monitoring and review of Catalyst projects, so that incorporating this into our mandate would be a good use of the communities funds as well as improve the utility and usefulness of our DAO.
As mentioned, SCAT DAO does not receive funding from any project that we audit. We feel that this is a direct conflict of interest that puts into question the legitimacy of any audit results that are found. In order to solve for this, the DAO will be issuing a token that is partially reserved by its treasury and invested into various yield generating opportunities that generate revenue and fund its operations. Eventually, we expect our treasury to be able to fund our audits as well as our monitoring of Catalyst projects, but it will take a bit of time to get to that point. To begin reviewing these sooner we are requesting additional funds that can be used to compensate our workforce that will be monitoring Catalyst projects until the treasury funding is robust and self-sustaining. All results of our monitoring will be written up into clear, easy to read reports, and will be distributed for the entire community through our website (SCATDAO.com).
Detailed information about how the DAO functions and is funded is provided on our website along with our Whitepaper. Please refer to SCATDAO.com to learn more about how the process works.
Road Map
One Month:
Develop comprehensive work program to monitor Catalyst winners. Examples of items that the work program will take into account in its monitoring are:
• Performance
• Achievements
• Financials
• Number of onboarded developers.
• Number of commits in funded proposal repositories (Github)
• Indicators of: transactions, volume and unique wallets interacting with dapps.
• Smart contract audit results.
• Social media engagement indicators.
As different projects will have different metrics to define their success, we will be sure to design the program to have various KPIs that we check for each different category that a project falls into. For example, a Defi applications would be assessed and monitored differently than a project to create educational YouTube videos.
Three Months:
Hire, onboard, and train our workforce who will be following the work program we develop and begin the monitoring of funded Catalyst projects. Within 3 months of receiving funding, we plan to publicly launch this aspect of our DAO and be actively monitoring Catalyst projects. 
Six Months:
The treasury should now be self-sustaining and SCAT DAO will now have funding to review all catalyst projects in perpetuity. No additional funds should be required from Catalyst and the ecosystem will now have a dedicated, scalable team who will be continuously reviewing Catalyst project and sharing our results with the community.
Budget:
Website $0 – Already covered through R5 Funding
Programming smart contract functionality $0 - Already covered through R5 Funding
Creating work program $0 - Already covered through R5 Funding
Paying Auditors working on behalf of the DAO for 6 months – 15,000
 
Measuring Success: If we receive funding and are able to incorporate this work into the mandate of our DAO, then success would be defined as every single project that receives funding through Catalyst would be monitored and reported on by us. Achieving partial results or covering a majority of projects would be a failure. We do not feel that any project funded through catalyst is more important than any other or deserves special focus. All funding awarded through Catalyst carries a responsibility to the community to spend it ethically and build something that will benefit the Cardano community. So our success will be defined by thoroughly reviewing all funded projects and delivering accurate and timely results to the community through our website.

Provide a tool for completion reports to share the final execution result and success metrics achieved and share that to the community",8,"Saturday, 21 August 2021 13:32",lovegrovegeorge,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/lovegrovegeorge/3056930-48088,Jakob Dickhaut,https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/member/Jakob-Dickhaut/3060916-48088,13700,Requested funds in USD,"

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
Proposals should have a completion report so that the community is more aware of when a proposal finished the work they were funded for. Thus, the community can review the impact the completed proposal had. The report should look at what the proposals aimed to execute, what ended up being executed and the results of that execution with any learnings that the community may benefit from.
This proposal is a follow on from the following fund 5 proposals - improve proposal data https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The enriched proposal data from these fund 5 proposals will be made available in an open source repository that anyone can fork and consume for their own projects. This proposal for proposal completion reports will build on top of that data set and produce more data for that repository that will get updated through the projectcatalyst.org community site.
A completion report for each funded proposal will help to make the auditing of funded proposals more efficient and transparent as it will provide the community with information on what funded proposals were delivering for the funded amount. The reports will be publicly available and attached to the proposal data. This will help with any auditing of what has happened in that proposal and also help guide whether the community will want to fund the proposal team for other proposals in the future.
 
Design
Check the attachments for a design mockup. This design is just to give an idea of what it could look like though please note that both how its executed and the design may change closer to implementation as we think about the solution more!
 
Development steps
- Collaborate with IOG and the community to confirm the completion report details that should be included when a proposal team has finished allocating their funds.
- Create a form on the proposal page to allow proposers to indicate they have completed a proposal and to fill in the relevant details on what was completed and the return on intention for the community to have access to.
- Render the completion report on the proposal pages that proposers have added and also provide a way for the community to filter all proposals based on the ones which have been completed.
- Implement adding the completion report to the open source proposal data repository so everyone will have access to completion reports for any given proposal to use as needed.
 
Roadmap
Getting existing proposal information into an open source repository will the pre-requisite to this proposal which involves completing fund 5 funded proposals for improving proposal information https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The data model for completion reports and functionality should take around 3 weeks to complete, further work is likely needed depending on whether IOHK has been recording this information. If so we will take that information and add it to existing data, if not then we will be looking to reach out to previous funded proposals to complete the completion report so the community has the data. In either event that manual work will likely take around 3 weeks to complete. Please note we would not expect to get complete coverage of creation of historic completion reports in that time frame if we had to reach out to previous funded proposals - it would be a best efforts situation which is naturally based off the responsiveness of the previously funded proposers. For future proposals we would push for it to become part of the process. In total the proposal should take around 6 weeks to complete.
- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.
- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.
- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed
 
Feasibility
- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps & Darlington has 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Between us we covers the skills needed to draft out a sensible data model, make it easy to gather the data and host that in a public API for the community. 
 
Impact
- Effective auditable information - By knowing which proposals are completed and whether they are executed successfully will help to give the community a good indication on the amount of proposals that are completed, how long they take on average to finish and what percentage of work planned to be completed actually gets executed.
- Inform future voting - All of completion report data will give auditable information mentioned previously that will help improve future voting based off how much impact each funded proposal made when they completed their proposal.
- Usage across tools - Public access to this the completion report information should help to allow different types of tooling to emerge such as analytic dashboards or more in depth reports and reviews on different proposals in the ecosystem. The better the data quality and easier it is to access the more likely the community is to create different tools - especially ones concerning auditing!
 
Auditability
- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.
- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst
- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e
- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7
 
Success metrics
- Increasing voter awareness of completion reports - For a completion report to be truly effective it will be important that voters are aware of it when voting for the same teams again in future funding rounds. This report along with any other proposal data will provide effective auditing of the impact of the proposal that can be compared with other potential proposals when deciding which should be funded. One number we can track is how many people are looking at proposals with completion reports added - especially near voting time. Another metric to follow is the number of tools like a voter tool that incorporate this information into their own tools.
 
What success looks like
The success of this proposal will be providing an effortless way for proposers to add a completion report to their proposal once they have completed allocating their funds. The secondary aspect is making sure the information is widely available (open source) and promoted to the community to share the information for auditing purposes as we collectively continue to improve the Catalyst process.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
Proposals after the finalized stage or also after being funded currently lack the ability to be kept up to date with relevant content about the proposal such as interviews, podcasts, articles, demos and any other relevant media content. Both proposers themselves or the community should be able to suggest content that should be added to the proposal data so it is easy for the community to understand everything going on for a given proposal - especially those that have been funded!
This proposal is a follow on from the following fund 5 proposals - improve proposal data https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The enriched proposal data from these fund 5 proposals will be made available in an open source repository that anyone can fork and consume for their own projects. This proposal media content proposal will build on top of that data set and produce more data for that repository that will be updated through the https://projectcatalyst.org community site.
This proposal helps meet the challenge of improving auditability of funded proposals by providing a way for both proposers and the community to add more content based information about a funded proposal. The more information that the community has relevant to each funded proposal the more efficient and transparent it is to the community to understand the impact of a proposal for its return on intention. The data will also be completely open source helping it to become more distributed in the community and allow for it to be more easily used in other contexts such as analysis on the effectiveness of proposals.
 
Design 
Check the attachments for a design mockup. This design is just to give an idea of what it could look like though please note this may change a bit when it gets implemented!
 
Development steps
- Add a media linking form to the proposal pages so that a proposer or trusted community member can link to any media content that is relevant to a given proposal.
- Present the media content on all the proposal pages so the community can view the media with the other relevant information.
- Take existing data for attachments from Ideascale to attach them to the historical proposals so that proposals have the historical media content data.
- Implement the adding the media content data to the open source proposal data repository so everyone gets access to media content for any proposal.
 
Roadmap
Getting existing proposal information into an open source repository will the pre-requisite to this proposal which involves completing fund 5 funded proposals for improving proposal information https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 Creating a data model for the media with the functionality should take around 3 weeks to complete however there is also manual work in bringing together historical data of attachments in Ideascale and other relevant media to previous proposals that will enrich the previously funded proposal data. This manual work will be fairly time consuming and likely take around 3 weeks to complete. In total the proposal will likely take around 6 weeks to complete.
- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.
- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.
- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed
 
Feasibility
- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps & Darlington has 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Between us we covers the skills needed to draft out a sensible data model, make it easy to gather new data and host that in a public API for the community.
 
Impact
- More up to date information - By providing a better process to keep media information up to date for a given proposal the community will be better informed on the progress or relevant information about what is happening.
- Inform future voting - Better media coverage of what is happening should help to inform future voting where the community can more easily audit interviews, demos or similar media content to gage the impact they are having in the ecosystem.
 
Auditability
- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.
- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst
- To see an overview of the entire PACE team information and active and funded proposals you can visit our documentation - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/PACE-c1b5ed092f0c43bdb7045a75b8592b0e
- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7
 
Success metrics
- Increasing the number of people viewing proposals - Tracking the traffic to proposal pages will give insight into the engagement of the community for a given proposal and whether they are viewing the media relevant to each proposal.
- Increasing the amount of proposal information coverage - Providing an easy way to attach relevant media to a proposal should help encourage people both working on the proposal team and also community members in the ecosystem to help link more relevant media content that will help with the auditing process.
 
What success looks like
The success of this proposal will mean providing an effortless way for proposers or trusted community members to be able to enrich a proposal with more media content as it becomes available. With that functionality the secondary thing is how that impacts the communities engagement with the proposals and use the extra proposal data to enrich their own tools or for analysis for auditing.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We want to build out a website where funded proposers are required to submit documentation supporting the amounts spent on their project and within the budget limits proposed.
We intend to use GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) when identifying risk.
We will produce an auditing handbook for the proposers and for the use of the auditors that clearly outlines the requirements to be fulfilled by the funded proposer.
We will also perform audits on projects based on audit profile risk and normal industry profiles. 
We intend to share these results and compliance activity with the Catalyst management team and on our website and twitter accounts to ensure the community is informed of audit results.
We will perform up to 40 Audits per Fund with the Funding Requested. Additional funding may be required to ensure audit risk is controlled. The number of audits projected in this pilot will not be sufficient to cover all the funded proposals in a given Fund.
We anticipate it will take 3 months to complete documentation and engage and train the team. The project should be able to audit the Fund8 participants and be fully functional from that point forward.
Note: A continuing funding request will be required for each fund to ensure audits are completed on time and within budget. Given the inability to forecast the number of funded proposals it will be difficult to project an ongoing continuing funding request.

After 3 months we should have completed 40 audits and have already submitted a funding request to cover a larger number of audits, perhaps 100, then at the 6-9 month marks we would hope to be able to audit all of the funded proposers and continue to evolve to perhaps hire these students (some of them) as permanent full time employees with the goal of creating more auditing tools that enhance the process, streamline the process and innovate to achieve good value for money spent.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Watch the pilot episode below.
We intend to create 1 video per month. 5-8 minutes long.
Every video should follow 2-3 proposers / funded teams and their story. The format is structured as an educational and inspirational programme. The Cardano community and a global audience can learn about Project Catalyst and the unique stories of each funded proposal.
The plan is to deliver 3 videos in total after the Fund 6 winners annoucement.
The first one will be delivered in November, the second one in December 2020 and the last one in January 2021.
If the Catalyst Stories are a success, we'd ask for more funds to create more stories in Fund 7.
This approach is great for existing proposers too, because they get a slot to talk about their project, and the video can be distributed with ease on multiple platforms and with interested stakeholders.
Furthermore, it will inspire others to follow a similar path via Project Catalyst.
The videos are distributed on our website via Vimeo and then organically to the viewers.
I need help here. I'm not a Youtuber, never will be. In essence I'm a documentary filmmaker and I intend to stay one. So I can create the content, but I need a marketing specialist who knows how to deliver the videos to a wider audience.
I still see the best option in IOHK's YT channel or as a part of Cardano 360. Not sure whether this is possible.
In the future I'd like to broadcast my work on TV but it's too soon at this stage.
I have a small crew of TV professionals and story tellers who are working with me on the project.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Overview
The community would benefit from having access to a history of update logs from the funded proposals to inform the community of the progress of any given funded proposal. The update logs should be convenient to find and attached to the existing proposal data and the data will also be open source with the other proposal data so that anyone can use it within other tools and projects.
For the progress updates the proposers should be able to confirm which of their roadmap items have been completed so the community is able to see a rough percentage of completion as well as any relevant technical or visual information that showcases and confirms that update. The PACE team have done update logs for the project on a weekly basis https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7 which provide a fairly accurate example of the type of updates that funded proposals could complete to provide more information for community auditing.
This proposal is a follow on from the following fund 5 proposals - improve proposal data https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking proposal https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The enriched proposal data from these fund 5 proposals will be made available in an open source repository that anyone can fork and consume for their own projects. This proposal for proposal progress update logs will build on top of that data set and produce more data for that repository that will get updated through the https://projectcatalyst.org community site.
Creating public progress update logs for proposals will address the challenge by providing an easy way for proposers to provide information about the progress of their funded proposal progress that will make it more efficient and transparent when the community audits their proposals are being executed correctly. The data will be completely open source so anyone in the community will be able to consume or analyse the updates from proposers to distribute the auditing process.
 
Design
Check the attachments for a design mockup. This design is just to give an idea of what it could look like though please note that both how its executed and the design may change a closer to implementation as we think about the solution more!
 
Development steps
- Add a progress update form to the proposal pages so that a proposer can detail out what has happened recently with any links or demos to showcase a proposal update.
- Present the progress update logs on any proposal pages that have added them for the community to view.
- Use existing data for update logs given to IOG for previously funded proposals and add this data to the proposal information so that it is historically up to to date.
- Implement the addition of adding the update log data to the open source proposal data repository so everyone gets access to this proposal update log data.
 
Roadmap
Getting existing proposal information into an open source repository will the pre-requisite to this proposal which involves completing fund 5 funded proposals for improving proposal information https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Improve-proposal-data/350686-48088 and project tracking https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Catalyst-Site-Project-tracking/350699-48088 The functionality will likely only take around 2 weeks to complete however there is also manual work in bringing together and likely standardising the historical update data that IOG has been capturing to date which will be added to the previously funded proposals and likely take around 3 weeks to complete. In total the proposal will likely take anywhere from 5 weeks to complete.
- 3 months - Development of the proposal, launch and start of integration within community and also monitoring and analysis of results. May also finish a completion report in this time frame.
- 6 months - Should be finished at this point though may write a completion report near the 6 month mark.
- 12 months - Proposal should already be completed
 
Feasibility
- Technology - George has over 5 years development experience in web and mobile apps & Darlington has 14 years in software development with 7 years within cloud infrastructure and DevOps. Between us we covers the skills needed to standardise the data and host it on a public API for the community.
- Data access - A requirement for this proposal will be getting access to the update logs provided to IOG. As this process needs to be decentralized over time and IOG already provide required data on request this should not be an issue.
 
Impact
- Increase proposal progress updates exposure - Public exposure of the proposal updates will benefit the community in auditing any proposals progress and also opens up more opportunity for feedback and support where it's needed. If a team is blocked on a problem the community may collectively have an answer to support proposers execution.
- Inform future voting - Current progress reports from existing funded proposals makes for valuable information to guide future funding decisions. If progress is slow with a well funded team then the progress updates will help provide a way to audit that progress and adjust voters preferences.
- Usage across tools - Public access to this the completion report information should help to allow different types of tooling to emerge such as analytic dashboards or more in depth reports and reviews on different proposals in the ecosystem. The better the data quality and easier it is to access the more likely the community is to create different tools - especially ones concerning auditing!
 
Auditability
- Open source code - The code developed for this proposal will be open source and free to use for the community making it easy to audit both its progress and final result.
- Finished development of any of our proposals can be found on the community site https://projectcatalyst.org or our Github repository https://github.com/projectcatalyst

- Our weekly development updates can be founded here - https://cardanocommunity.notion.site/Project-updates-7f42f8cc1648444dbfe6e18b74ccc3b7
Success metrics
- Number of proposers submitting proposal updates - We can track how many proposers adds proposal updates through our system providing IOG agrees this could become an accepted input source.
- Increasing the number of people viewing proposals - Tracking the traffic to proposal pages will give insight into the engagement of the community for a given proposal and viewing their progress update logs.
- Increasing the regularity and quality of the updates given by proposers - Setting a standard for the update logs should help make it fast and easy for proposers to provide updates on what is happening. The more proposers that complete this regularly the better information the community has for auditing each funded proposal.
 
What success looks like
The success of this proposal will come down to creating an effortless way for proposers to provide progress updates that provides enough information to understand how the project is doing. The second part is that it effectively allows the community to view this information and use the data as needed in any of their own tools or analysis for auditing. This proposal is an initial stepping stone for helping with auditability where a more refined proposal progress update system can be developed over time.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


We have built a first iteration of the directory, currently living at https://www.lidonation.com/en/catalyst-proposals. This initial version of the directory already allows users to view all proposals, search by title keywords, or filter by fund, challenge, funded status, and over-budget proposals. Users can sort proposals by requested budget and yes votes. Directory listings include proposal problem/solution outlines, infographics, project team details, and website links.  
Funding this proposal will enable us to set up infrastructure and provide an API that toolmakers can use to build oracles and other interesting interfaces for improving and growing audibility.  
 
## Partnerships
Our work complements what's being done by the fine folks, George and Jakob, over at PACE. PACE received funding in round 5 to begin standardizing catalyst data. LIDO Nation is cooperating with PACE on this effort, and looking to extend their work by creating an API for the community. it In this fund we will also work together to add additional rich data if these proposals are funded: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/PACE-Proposal-completion-reports/367498-48088, https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/PACE-Proposal-media-content/367365-48088, and https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/PACE-Proposal-progress-updates/367266-48088.
The big idea is to take the data from the PACE collaboration, combine it with data in our directory and provide an open API for the community as well as an open source data repository. This data can be used in many ways including but not limited to:

Our own cardanotreasury.org site for generating informative charts and graphs.
The PACE site as a directory and for proposal teams to manage.
The voter tool or community advisor tool could use our API to get historical data to help improve the experience by using up to date proposal data
https://www.lidonation.com/catalyst-proposals directory can be enriched to serve as a more robust research tool.
Anyone else in the community who wants to use the data for their own tool.

## About Us
We are two blockchain enthusiasts. Darlington is an engineer by day and at all times a dancer, humanitarian, idealist and entrepreneur.
Stephanie is a teacher and technologist with a passion for helping non-profits navigate and capitalize on technology.
 
## Definition of Success

Lidonation.com is using api to further enrich the treasury dashboard and catalyst proposal directory
https://projectcatalyst.org/proposals is using api to provide a rich ui for the community to follow, audit and track catalyst proposals
The community is using the API to create other interesting use cases.

 
## Roadmap


1 Month: Setup infrastructure, and build GraphQL API for current data. Release beta GraphQL API for proposal data (fund1 through fund5)


3 Months: Release production ready GraphQL API for proposal data including fund 6 data. Launch beta, then production GraphQL API for Cardano treasury API enriched with on chain and catalyst data.


6 Months: Audit API uses, collect community feedback (and/or wishlist), triage and deliver non-breaking low hanging fruits.


Research potential for crowdsourced translations.


Scope localization of api.


Scope what it would take to add a rich text search engine to API with support for multiple languages.


Future: If the directory is providing value to the community, we will continue to iterate in response to the community need and feedback. We hope future funding will be secured by donations and/or another proposal depending on the challenges chosen. The LIDO Nation pool is also committed to providing some funding from pool rewards.
 
## Budget
infrastructure: $4,200: $700/month for testing and production infrastructure for, messaging, and database infrastructure x 6 months.
Development and Documentation ($12,000): Already spent about 120 hours developing and sanitizing current beta. Estimating an additional 200 hrs of development and documentation @ 65/hr. Darlington will donate any additional coding hours.

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


Main Deliverable
Dedicated auditing team experienced in the reporting of Africa-based proposals, including platform development for reporting on metrics, financials and dApp performance.
---------IMPACT--------
By hiring experienced community advisors and students familiar with auditing process in law and accounting departments, WADA will create a 3-month auditing program where auditors will be tasked with creating bi-monthly reports, articles and videos on their assigned proposals.
This will result in:

Increased visibility for the projects
A steady stream of updates
Improved tracking of performance metrics
A more robust auditing process as we identify best practices

-------FEASIBILITY---------
Past Successes and Future Outlook:
With several successfully funded proposals under its belt, WADA is well-placed to deliver an auditing program and hire the necessary resources from its partners (https://www.blockchainedu.org/) and from within its own network.
With a membership platform currently being developed, there is an opportunity to create an auditing function to include performance tracking, social media analytics and accounting features.
Roadmap:

30 days - Outline auditing process, framework and supporting documentation
30 days - Hire 10 students and CAs to carry out the auditing process, with program management by WADA.
Expected public launch date: Jan 15th
90 days - Beginning in Fund 7, carry out audit until project completion or time duration is up.

Budget breakdown:
Admin team fees $6000
Auditing team fees $12000
Platform and development costs $4000
Marketing $1000
---------AUDITABILITY----------
What success looks like:
Successful audit of over 80% of proposals given. 90% completed within timeline and with 90% accuracy. At least 50 unique content pieces (articles and videos) are created on the proposals as a whole.
After a successful audit program, a resubmission in Fund 8 will take place for a larger program.

3 months: Auditors hired, projects identified and allocated, platform developed
6 months: Audits completed and reviewed, with unique content created for all projects
12 months: Application for larger audit program through Catalyst

Key Metrics:

No. Proposals under audit
No. Articles written
No Reports delivered
No. Video created
No. Auditors in the program

Risk Management:
Auditing standards: WADA will oversee the program and create documentation around auditing standards for the initial group of 10 to follow. After the program is successfully concluded, a review of these standards will take place, best practices from the program will be identified and incorporated into an updated handbook and a larger program will be submitted in a future funding round.
Auditors' commitment: By having an application process, we will only select those who have a demonstrated commitment to completing the program, as well as tying incentives to the completion of the audits, within the timeframe given.
Quality of content: Similarly, by our application process, but also by limiting the number of proposals under audit for each hire, as well as applying a bi-monthly cadence to the reporting times, we can ensure a high quality of output across individuals

Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build an automated distributed auditability system.
At its heart Project Catalyst is an experiment to develop distributed governance for the Cardano blockchain. So, meeting the challenge to improve and grow auditability requires a distributed approach. An effective and equitable distribution of auditability will require connections between the funded proposer and the community to be established, the communal development of transparent audit methods and constant iteration.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revisiting the Problem Statement
Project Catalyst is rapidly expanding, and its decentralized funding platform needs to develop common audit standards to apply to its funded proposals. At large scale if there is no way to compare the performance of proposals then there is no means by which return on intent can be assessed.
No consistent evaluation will lead to a lack of understanding of why proposals fail or succeed. This will obscure what can be learnt from the Catalyst experiment.
Manual reporting is time-consuming, prone to error and creates inconsistencies between proposals.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution Overview
Drawing on lessons learnt to date tracking and documenting Catalyst Swarm and Quality Assurance DAO this proposal will research reporting workflows, then develop and deploy automated reporting & tracking using Continuous Integration tools such as GitHub Actions.
A library of Continuous Integration tools will assist with consistent evaluation of funded proposals and make reporting processes more transparent.
Automated reporting & tracking is less time-consuming than manual reporting. Each event is run through a batch process that exposes any errors and is reproducible; thereby promoting consistent reporting.

Stephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects. Relevant experience for this proposal includes Program Test Management (IBM) and Quality Assurance Management (BNP-Paribas).
He currently develops, maintains documentation and provides technical project management support for Catalyst Swarm.
In Fund 5 of Project Catalyst Stephen's QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) submitted a proposal ""Quality Assurance DAO"" in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge that was funded in August 2021.
Stephen provides support to Catalyst Swarm by documenting and tracking it's activities. This has been done continuously since 7th July 2021 by raising GitHub issues that track Core Swarm Activities such as meetings, After Town Halls, events (Idea Fest) and Saturday Swarm Sessions. The evolution of the governance of Catalyst Swarm is documented and updated here - https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/governance/overview .

Roadmap
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The present – Fund 5 QA-DAO proposal and community collaborations.
In August 2021 the F5: Developer ecosystem proposal Quality-Assurance-DAO ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Quality-Assurance-DAO/351678-48088 ) was successful in receiving votes and was funded. This confirmed that voters wish to see Quality Assurance Implemented in Project Catalyst and provides support for this proposal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 0 : Prior to Funding - Research and prototyping – present to November 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Research
How different teams and individuals report the progress of their funded proposals will be researched.
This Fund 6 Auditability proposal will draw upon the successful Fund 5 Developer ecosystem proposal for research. This will be done in collaboration with the funded cohort, IOG and Catalyst ecosystem toolmakers such as Catalyst Swarm.
Lessons Learnt to date
The ongoing experience of working with a widely distributed team such as Catalyst Swarm, working on many different projects, has led to automation solutions such as Issue templates and forms.
Qualitative lessons have also been learnt within Catalyst Swarm in respect of the amount of reporting and tracking required. In terms of what is manageable and what is meaningful to team members. The best incentive is a team understanding of who contributes what to a project - so that work is fairly attributed and costed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 - Continuous Integration Development - November 2021 to December 2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once funded Distributed Auditability will build upon lessons learnt in research and prototyping to automate reporting & tracking using Continuous Integration tools such as GitHub Actions.
Building on prototypes from Phase 0 specific auditing workflows will be automated using GitHub Actions.
Auditability Workflows
Data from funded cohort reporting, Swarm tracking and qualitative research (into how reporting varies) will inform the design of auditability workflows. An auditability workflow will model the working practices of participants, the metrics they report on, whether this fit into their own documentation and how they might benefit from automation.
Auditability Workshops
In addition a related proposal Open-Source-Training ( F6: DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox proposal ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Source-Training/368678-48088 ) offered in collaboration with the Catalyst School will will offer workshops to assist early stage entrepreneurs in discovering their workflows and examining how these may be documented, reported on and automated. If the Open-Source-Training is funded data from workshop workflows will also feedback into Continuous Integration Development.
Continuous Integration Development
Auditability workflows identified from tracking and research will be translated to GitHub Actions for development and testing.
This will comprise of :

Batch jobs that will raise & close tracking issues, meeting minutes, contribution surveys and biweekly reports automatically.

 

Interface with Catalyst Fund data to prefill issue templates & reports.

 

Interface with and update static site website with team workflow status and reporting.

 

Setup trigger events on pull requests.

 

Sending status bots to Discord servers.

 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 2 - Continuous Integration Deployment - January 2022 to February 2022
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From January 10th 2022 QA-DAO will begin to deploy Continuous Integration tools at pilot GitHub Organisations such as Catalyst Swarm, SecretDecks and Quality Assurance DAO.

Auditability workflows identified in Development (above) will be deployed and tested in the pilot GitHub Organisations.

 

Deployment and test reports will be produced to document how effective the tools are.

Science is becoming the most important source for evidences for Governments and expert advisors when developing Public Policies. The problem is that science need funds to be developed and accomplished, during the last decades those funds have been coming from private sector, which intentions have been clearly not to further develop scientific and social knowledge, but rather it was to guide science to the type of results which fits their needs of evidences (real intention of the funders).
Our future science should be decentralized and transparent, where the funds come from anonymous  and altruist people willing to collaborate with science. A new platform where scientist from all around the world can connect to develop different papers, theories and/or hypothesis regarding a topic whit a strong social interest, for example, Crypto, Climate, Governance, Social movements, Human Rights, etc.
All the people which participate can do it remotely and do not need to know each other from advance, this will fit the best people (with stronger interests on each topic) with the best topics for them, this due to the possible scoring that each participant will have based on peers opinion after or during the development of a project. The payment will be done with a token (ADAnized) which will be minted as an stable coin from the donations (funds) pools.

Nowadays, renewable energy has always been proposed and implemented by big players with large amounts of money.
Why don't we bring decentralized renewable energy to everybody creating a DAO?
The DAO will be responsible to create a platform where small businesses can upload their projects. Those projects will be revisioned and helped by a community of experts and companies connected to the field.
Projects can then be funded by the community locking the tokens in a smart contract.
The community will then be rewarded by the electricity bills that the business will pay until the wind turbine will be repaid. (6-10 months)
Afterwards, the smart contract will be opened and the tokens unstacked.
The turbine will remain in the state grid and will be owned by the DAO creating free energy for the business and the country grid. (Incentive to be approved by the state)

Not many people know yet about Catalyst and Cardano, This is an idea that I will leave here for now and anybody feel free to make it its own and even create a proposal of it.
The idea is to publish ads in local newspapers since these newspaper publishers these days make the publication automatically, it is easier to publish these ads like once a week and renew them every week or even every month, by just paying in advance to these local publishers. One of the advantages of this type of advertising is that when someone publishes something, these local publishers advertise the same ad in many local towns (in the USA for example) in a week, so they do this  by regions at once
This idea can be used to advertise in the whole USA in all local newspapers. We know that local ads have different sizes and prices, so for this, it has to be something precise, refined, something that will attract businesses owners' attention and take action engaging into Catalyst community and connect their businesses into Cardano.
The idea I have in mind is publishing on those sections of a newspaper where the size is about the size of a business card more or less approximately, which probably uses about 20 - 30 words?

Collateralized debt platforms do not rely on lenders to provide liquidity as they can mint the stable-
coins themselves. With no refinancing costs, such systems can generate liquidity for free. Yet, most
platforms charge recurring fees for borrowing (as high as 20.5% ) which accumulate over time.
The variable fees (stability fees) are meant to regulate coin supply in order to maintain the peg of
the issued stable coin and correspond to an interest rate in traditional banking. Affecting new and
existing loans alike, interest rates only have an indirect impact on monetary supply and are rather
ineffective in the short term. While existing borrowers may not have the means to repay their loans
as an immediate reaction to rising interest, short-term speculators and leverage seekers might not be
greatly affected by interest rates in the first place.
 
Our solution:
XETB Protocol provides liquidity without charging borrowers interest or recurring fees. ETH holders
can obtain liquidity against their collateral for free. However, as an algorithmically controlled monetary instrument, the protocol charges a Borrowing Fee (as a one-time fee) for newly drawn liquidity
to support the peg with the ETB.
Users are free to utilize their stable coin, SETB, to participate in the broader Defi market consisting of many different products which are designed to generate yield.

I believe the gap between the current state and the expected or envisioned state is relevant to how much time is necessary to find what you're seeking. Currently there is an overabundance of information that needs to be either filtered or curated. I think one solution is envision a much simpler dashboard that focuses on identifying potential matches for the user. Therefore categorizing would help by identifying what the user is interested in (ie. Build, Collaborate, Vote, Explore, Incentives, Education etc). Additional, one key feature that I've yet to encounter, maybe it exists, but an external share feature would be nice to incorporate as this could help with adoption. If i know someone who is interested in something relevant it would be nice to share outside of the platform.

SPOs are dependent on the central energy resources in which we don't know where the power comes from. Running stake pool operators is extremely energy efficient comparing to mining Bitcoin. Besides, currently, most SPOs remain dependent on the central energy resources in which we don't know where the electricity comes from. Cardano community needs to ensure building global sustainable models and use the capacity to regenerate our ecosystems. Therefore decreasing our need for central resources by promoting off-grid solutions through renewable energy resources is important.

And start to be thinking of growing their investment which the best way to knowing more about Cardano behind the everyday price.
Current state: Too many documents to read from tons of sites and videos/podcasts are not being verified and endorsed by the majority of Project Catalyst contributors and Cardano users. The result is time-wasting, exhaust and frustrating due to can not find relevant materials and answers.
 
Expected or envisioned: A system may name as ""Project Catalyst self-driven learning system (PC-SLS)"" where experience contributors are posting podcasts less than 5 mins, for example, and users/learners/viewers able rate and the algorithm could be ranking and giving the newbie the best suggestion for a type of knowledge when search.

New Cardano developers require readily available smart contract templates that they can use to jumpstart their projects. This library will need to be constructed in a modular fashion so that developers can combine components from different templates as they build their dapps.
The most visible example of a template library is the OpenZeppelin project which is popular with Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain developers. This library contains solutions to common problems and articulates the different types of contracts that can be created.
As of this writing, there are a few smart contract examples for Cardano but they are not well documented and there are not enough of them.

As is, many Africans are already interested in crypto currencies as a whole. West Africa is one of the most populated crypto markets worldwide, it is also mong the highest volume of cryptotrading, despite government indifference. This means that crypto is already incredibly popular among the people, especially the youths.
 
Cardano could leverage this preexisting goodwill by a publicity campaign which can and would lead to more adoption, given it's relatively infant state and easy on board rate. Thereby leading to benefits for all the parties in the long run.

Pet Microchip company's currently have a private database of animal owners. There are multiple companies that all have different user interfaces that are slow, inconsistent and often inaccurate.
Creating a NFT database using already existing pet Microchip numbers to establish the owner of a pet could radically transform the way lost pets are handled and saved. Further this has untold potential for animal shelters, zoos, breeders, livestock, etc..
Imagine the ability to scan a lost dog for a chip using a cell phone, contact the owner via an app and return the dog. Even be able to receive a reward via the app using Ada. 
An animal shelter could establish ownership of rescued dogs or transfer ownership between two individuals. 
Breeders could track lineage via block chain as well as owners and future litters, this opens the door to kennel clubs and breed registries. 
Zoo's, vets and shelters, could track animal data using a microchip NFT as a unique identifier incorporated into existing software for medical issues, bite reports, ownership history etc...

Currently in Africa especially South Africa the leadership of the the PSL South African Football Premier league is made up of people that owns clubs that are involved in the competitions they are leading. This has a direct impact on the decisions that are taken in favour of their favourite teams to the exclusion of the other teams. Even the match officials are also implicated in this sports corruption as they end up taking decisions that favours their bosses those that own these teams owned by PSL CEOs.

This leads to the loss of money and the errors that we see on social networks. Worse in Africa, users have twice as many worries: international exchangers do not accept local identity documents during kyc, impossible to be able to pay directly for cryptocurrencies with local currency, they are forced to take third parties, and in the end it is too expensive for them. In addition, international exchangers are not able to help users by taking into account the amateurism of the latter. To name just these problems.

After watching the Cardano Summit I was inspired to start looking into the possibility of building an eco system for our project. We are currently developing a campus of dome structure in WA. (short term rental ) Oculislodge.com . We started the permit process and planning to start the construction soon on the first show case unit. We are currently raising capital with wefunder where you will be able to see what we are trying to achieve. Multiple campuses of short term rentals.
After watching part of the Cardano summit I was inspired to build a similar VR World where investors/guests/founder/board member could interact in the same platform for everyone to contribute to the project and create a strong community.
Some of the core ideas of what could be done. All this would happen in a VR world like the one at the Cardano Summit.
1. When people book a unit with a native token they would get rewards (tokens) making them part of the company . Booking a room will be done in vr making the booking experience fun. (no more booking site like airbnb, booking.com They could interact with the other guests via chat with existing guest or past guest. (avatar will be created and they will be able to navigate through the campus to choose their units and book , shop in the virtual shop ETC Check out VR tour of our structure here
2. Investing can be done on the VR platform. A token will be created. Tokens will be created to complete milestones. Each campus will be created in VR in conjunction with their real life progress. Investors will be able to interact with other investors /founder in VR. (Guest will become investors by collecting tokens as rewards)
3. board meetings/investor relations. New Developtment presentation would happen in vr where everyone can contribute and vote (at a large VR meeting table). Involvement would be rewarded.
4. integration of financial tools to further finance
5. I am open to ideas
To sum it up I would want to combine multiple application into one ecosystem to create transparency and a strong community.
I believe this would create a more social business. 
How do I get started? Is this a feasible project for any developer? Any graphic designer out there ?
All the best to the Cardano community !! Congrats on the summit.

There should be items/colors/tags to depict yourself to spaces. The avitor should have a vibe and personailty that can be seen from a distance. Wallets and other flex items should be awarded for completing community tasks. This assimilation between worlds will later use hardware to help bring personal items onto your avitor.

Cardano is listing numerous dapps and there is little to no information as to the vetting process. The ICO market is rife with fraud and something needs to be done about it.  As an example: Plutuswap created a nice website regarding an upcoming dex on the Cardano blockchain and offered ""their token"" after exchanging ADA.  Plutuswap no longer exists and the scammers have gotten away with a lot of money of the adherents to Cardano.
 
What I propose is:
Any ICO that is to be on the Cardano blockchain must use a ""smart contract"", that will only release funds received by the ICO when certain milestones are met. 
It is to easy for a bad actor to create a fake dapp and sell coins.  Having an escrow like smart contract that only releases the funds as milestones are met will help eliminate the scammers and increase the trust in the Cardanosphere.

Currently scammers are targeting ADA holders across Social Media platforms, phishing documents, websites, fake mobile apps, fake dApps and rug-pulls.
I envision using the immutable nature of the blockchain to empower the community to flag a scammers wallet address and monitor the movement of stolen Cryptocurrency on Cardano. 
This would be done by having dApps, Dex' and wallets having a ""report scam"" button built in, which would ""black list"" the scam wallet. In addition to community self-reports, tools such as the Cardano Phishing Bot (Twitter: @CardanoPhishing) could be utilised to identify scams in real-time, scrape the scam wallet address from the scammer's website and generate a contract preventing funds being sent to the scam wallet address. The victim would make a failed transaction and receive a notification alerting them of the scam and links to educate the victim on scams.
To prevent malicious reporting of wallet addresses, the person reporting would have to provide a URL from the originating scam and the exact amount of ADA stolen, the URL could be analysed for scam content.
Exchanges and DEX would be invited to work with the project to prevent converting to other crypto or fiat. If the report came in late and scammer was successful in converting to fiat, the scam report, blockchain data, wallet address and KYC from the exchange could be sent to law enforcement to investigate.

The current way your family may treat chores maybe working great. I have 2 kids and 2 stepkids would like them to be responsible and clean up after themselves. Basic Right? -Wrong! 
Currently parents yell at kids for many reasons could be not cleaning up, maybe not cleaning up to par, maybe they do not want to ask them to do the same basic chores over and over.

Here is the clash to fill the gap Solution= ""vote on name"" (#Cleaning Dapp)- Parents will program basic tasks by scanning house of items in correct spot and ideal setups. Kids will be given a list of tasks for rewards they can complete. 
To achieve the task, you must verify it was completed to standard. Where parents can verify live or with geo datatags they set for whatever reward amount.

Currently transaction fees on Cardano are fixed to the price of ADA, so if ADA goes up or down, relative to the dollar, so do transaction fees. This has meant that in the space of 1 year, fees have gone from less than a cent per transaction, to over 40 cents. 
I understand that this is no where near the huge fees we've seen on Ethereum, but it is enough to start to put some people off using Cardano and to look elsewhere. Also, if ADA continues to rise in price, the fees will only get higher too. So a $10 ADA would mean $1.70 transaction fees. 
I feel that this issue could be quite a big barrier to the growth of the network if not addressed soon, and I've not aware of any current plans to do so.
I therefore propose a change to the transaction fee formula/structure, that would result in long term stable price (in terms of dollar value) and low price.
I understand that there are other factors that are connected to transaction fees, like staking rewards, and that the fees cannot be 0, but if fees were less than a cent per transaction a year ago, why can't they be set at that value long term?
I am not a programmer or developer, so there may be technical or logistical reasons why this is impossible, but if networks like Solana can have transactions fees below a cent, even when their market cap is in the top 10, then why can't Cardano.
I think that a Cardano with guaranteed low and stable transaction fees would be hugely beneficial to its growth and prosperity and that if left unaddressed could pose a big problem in the months and years to come, leading to migration of users to other blockchains.

Africa, and for that matter, Ghana's population is growing at a fast pace and subsequently is our unemployment rate, which is also increasing at an alarming rate, giving the scare of insecurities among the populace. In addition, the future of work is borderless and in this Internet of Things (or) era, technological skills are high on demand but supply, on the other hand, is gravely lacking.
For these reasons, we are seeking to provide a 60 monthly blueprint to enable the government of Ghana in partnership with Aya as well as other interested stakeholders to Equip, Empower and Provide borderless-in-demand skills for the Global Future of Work.

Predicting catastrophic failure is integral to safe design.  Construction design should consider contribution of heat transfer chemicals (HVAC, lubrication, fire etc) used in a structures' life-cycle operations.  Construction stakeholders (lead designers) are not transparently standing up for their decisions which prioritize profit over planetary health.  Decisions are not totemed for affect on planetary health.  Sometimes engineer sign-off occurs digitally without knowledge of the engineer.  Decisions can be tracked for predicted likelihood of catastrophe, temporal catastrophe tolerance level, stakeholder name, etc.  If it can be measured we can better manage it.  Blockchain can facilitate memorializing stakeholder decisions in construction.  This also could identify which countries are more risk tolerant (China, UK, etc.).  We may access thousands of data points on futball and cricket players, because much money is at stake in gambling.  Construction decisions gamble with health and profitability of entire planet.

Presently, navigating through the ""cryptosphere"" is daunting  and making one  mistake could result in losing your coins. 
The need for a ""cardano for dummies"" program is vital for mass adoption. A step by step video guide of how to purchase and stake cardano and unstake cardano is needed, as well as as a guide to what Cardano has to offer, especially when the smart contracts become available.  There needs to be reasons why someone who would not typically use tokens, should use tokens.
I have read the ideas on this forum and they are great, however, most are far beyond the simple user (such as myself). If there is to be mass adoption, I believe you need to keep it as simple as possible with the best step by step directions. Cardano has developed by the ""you need to walk before you can run"" motto and that was in the developers' world.  Cardano might be able to run shortly, but most of the users you want to attract are not even walking, more like crawling.  
The beginner is important for success and if the user interfaces are difficult and confusing, they will give up and not try.  I speak from experience.  I ask when you are creating something for mass adoption that you consider the person who is going to utilize it knows nothing.

The current academic system is closed, expensive and unfair.  The answer to the closed nature of academic publishing is often considered to be open access models where researchers/institutions pay prohibitively expensive Article Processing Charges (APCs)  to have their scientific materials reviewed, edited and published. Editors and peer reviewers are rarely paid and the process can take up to several years for articles. 
I propose here a Cardano-based publishing system which is focussed on openness and transparency and which is fast and responsive; fairly priced and which rewards and incentivizes high quality editors and peer reviewers through smart contracts set in reference to APCs.  Concurrently, this system would encourage research participant engagement with studies through Cardano-based incentives and would facilitate near real time sharing of data through decentralised clinical trials. The overall aim would be to be living, real-time, high quality research gathering and publication.

Catalyst voters get to vote on the project, but the project description leaves out details that might expose the idea. All details about the project is only know to the Catalyst advisors assigned to the project. Project proposal description might contain a statement from the advisors that this project is vital for the community to fund by giving examples or praise for the project.

There isn't a widely socialized or accepted methodology for conflict resolution practiced within the Catalyst community currently.
 
For instance there are several ways these things are handled in other organizations. See below.
Simple 3-Step Conflict Resolution Scheme
To maintain a healthy community we need to settle differences, or solve disagreements, and there are simple ways we can do that. We can employ some basic principles that can help us to solve problems and keep good relationships with others.
Here is a simple three-step process: 

first, endeavor to settle the matter privately between those involved; 
second, if the initial step fails, bringing along a witness or two; 
and third, if the preceding step fails, taking the matter to the community as represented by the community leaders or advisors.

When we have an issue, conflict, dispute, or disagreement, it is a practical principle to approach the opposing individual, entity or institution with your position or concern. It's a best practice to allow them to hear from you directly about the reasons for your concern. Many times, it can be resolved by simply communicating and increasing each other's understanding. 
 If they do not acknowledge the issue nor offer to participate in resolving it, the second step can be taken. This involves including just one or two others who are aware of your concern, who can perhaps support your claim and influence a resolution. Your goal should be a peaceful conflict resolution in the spirit of community. 
 If this doesn't resolve the issue, your next option should be to involve those who are responsible for maintaining a healthy community. Once it is brought to the community leaders, it should be left with them.
If you aren't satisfied with how the community leaders address the concern, you are free to express your independence and leave the community. This is not new, as rage quitting is a common phenomenon in similar communities.  Below are some quotes from communities with programmatic rage quitting solutions.
Rage Quitting
""Rage quitting gives them the ability to express their discontent publicly and excommunicate themselves from the DAO.""
https://github.com/pie-dao/docs/blob/master/pie-dao/rage-quitting.md
""""Quitting"" is a right.
In DAO speak, ""rage quit"" … is probably more aptly called ""freedom to leave"" or something like that.""
https://daohaus.substack.com/p/rage-quit-exit-rights-and-real-skin
""Ragequit is the magic sauce
The ragequit mechanism of Moloch lowers the coordination cost even more. It ensures that if you, a member, really don't like a proposal you can exit with your funds before the proposal goes through.""

DEFINITIONS AND RESEARCH
Conflict Resolution Law and Legal Definition
Conflict resolution means a process of resolving dispute or disagreement. It mainly aims at reconciling opposing arguments in a manner that promotes and protects the human rights of all parties concerned.
Generally, conflict resolution adopts the following five methods:
(1) problem solving or confrontation in which the two parties work together to find out a common solution;
(2) compromising in which both sides arrive on an agreement about their gain and loss;
(3) forcing in which the person having power direct a solution for acceptance by the other;
(4) smoothing in which the major points of agreement are given attention and disagreement between the two sides are not highlighted; and
(5) withdrawing in which either one or both sides withdraws from conflict.
The term conflict resolution is also known as dispute resolution or alternative dispute resolution. Other methods adopted for conflict resolution include negotiation, mediation, and diplomacy. Sometimes arbitration, litigation, and formal complaint processes such as ombudsman processes are also referred as conflict resolution.
https://definitions.uslegal.com/c/conflict-resolution/
 
""Dispute resolution or dispute settlement is the process of resolving disputes between parties. The term dispute resolution is sometimes used interchangeably with conflict resolution, although conflicts are generally more deep-rooted and lengthy than disputes. Dispute resolution techniques assist the resolution of antagonisms between parties that can include citizens, corporations, and governments.""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_resolution
 
Other communities address dispute or conflict resolution using similar methods as above.

1)For easier access to the relevant proposal information I already use the community project at https://cardanocataly.st/voter-tool/#/ , because it is easier than using the Catalyst-In-App functionality (for me at least). I think it's a great resource to see CA feedback and give a summary of the project and prepare my votes. It would be ideal to being able to export my vote selection from cardanocataly.st and import it into the Catalyst-App for voting. At the same time I could share my selection with friends and like-minded people who value my research.
2)After a vote is chosen in the Catalyst app, please make the app come back to the selected project position in the app. It is very tedious to have to scroll back down the whole list of projects to get to the current standing (especially if you want to vote for a large number of projects).

Currently, there are many submissions that need to be evaluated. This will grow exponentially.
 
Instead of Kudos, we can use a virtual currency that accrues over time to both incentivise people to join and participate in the selection process.
 
People can use this currency to claim ownership of any submitted ideas. This signals interest to others, and motivates the claimant to further the submission to increase their payouts if it gets funded. And even users who don't have interest / capacity to improve the proposals are incentivised to look for proposals with the highest potential payouts, which get diluted quickly for popular submissions. 
 
Eventually, this activity would result in a hierarchy of topics, constantly evaluated and refined by the community. In time, this could cover all topics in all industries, and serve as a replacement for current IP protection efforts (patents), while incentivising open sharing and quick collaboration. 
 
The required modifications to enable this is drafted in attached document, along with a quick pitch for the patent replacement project (from a sadly failed hackathon attempt).

ADA has massive potentials to solve Africa's numerous currencies issues.  Its becoming very difficult for inter country trading.  The newly African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) initiative has brought much hope to entrepreneurs of the continent but two major issues stands as a bottle neck.
1. Numerous Currencies
2. Inter bank exchange rates, delays and regulations
So in a bid to start addressing these issues a simple approach for mass adoption campaign for Africans to start using  ADA cryptocurrency is needed.
My company Glonextech  ( Global Next Technology ) registered in South Africa, operating in Cape Town have been working with a team of cryptosystem enthusiasts, economists and legal experts to define ways to develop a fully functional set of free ecommerce plugins  that will equip shopping carts, POSs across the African Continent to incorporate the use of ADA as native or secondary currency for buying goods and services.  
Every ecommerce platform will install the plugin to start trading or accepting ADA.  Goods can be displayed in local Fiat currencies, upon checkout the buyer or shopper may choose to pay with ADA and earn points.  The plugin will be linked to a smart contract that generate ADA wallets for every app user.
The plugin will be developed and deployed freely across multiple ecommerce marketplace such as magento, wordpress, shoplify etc.
The second layer is to develop ADA Faucet App and plastic Cards linked to the smart contract.  These cards will be printed in large quantities and freely distributed to the public. The cards will be link to the app running a smart contract on the users phone. Any predefined use case will generate points.  Points or tokens can be converted to ADA by means of swapping, tokens can be used on ecommerce platforms running our plugins, fuel stations or garage, restaurant or shops that subscribed to attract cards holders as customers. 
As  partners on the network all purchases will reduce  credits form a pool. That means anytime a user buys from any partners shop using ADA, the wallet app generate free tokens that are redeemable by swapping to earn more ADA. Some may be converted to get discount on fuel and call credit on the app.
Therefore users will be required to download the management app that will create an ADA wallet, issue public addresses. Network partners will have a separate interface either through a plugin back end of their ecommerce store or POS and link to any swapping machine. Partners will also have a separate app to centrally manage their accounts.
Anytime a user buys ADA or transact using ADA, simply they can copy and paste the transaction code to earn fuel or call credits.
Users can use the card at any partner petrol station or. Uy Call credits from the app directly. As user become comfortable in shopping with ADA they can swap tokens in-app for ADA. 
Partner network menbers or vendors will credit a pool with the partner app or plugin with ADA to get buying traffic or  customers. That's the same ADA the smart contract will distribute as points to users. Anytime a partner credits the pool, his business or services will display on that locality closest to ADA shoppers or card holders. Shoppers or card holders can search partners in the app directory. Anytime shoppers swaps their card partners profile, credits automatically reduces until it depletes.
Majority of working class youths in many African countries ride on bikes and or have phones that need data as they carry on with business everyday. The fuel and calling credit the app will offer will encourage many to sign up creating ADA wallets everywhere which will intern attract more partners/vendors to sign up and credit the pool.
To motivates youths to massively adopt ADA, A life style of carrying an ADA faucets card with an app that converts point for ADA will drive massive adoption and excitement.  The cards can be swapped at shops, restaurants, garages, fuelling station etc.  
Many inter African trades will also be possible, ecommerce platforms with our plugin can attract buyers or card holders across the continent. Accepting ADA as payment takes away the stress of currency conversion and slow movement of cash, high transation fees etc. 
Glonextech don't need to reinvent the wheel but use simple common techniques to attract Africa's young population to up skill their passion for innovation. Cardano  ADA at the minds and pockets of everyone in Africa.

Once every blockchain technology would copy Cardano's model of involving Congress members, the Cardano community would be proud to be one of the main big names like Bitcoin, Etheuren Cryptos to provide Congress members the first crypto. You could imagine how it was to receive the first email in the 1990s.
We have the luck of information for Congress members, and the best way to learn about Blockchain technology science would be to contribute, therefore providing an opportunity for congress members campaign to use crypto for their own interest in a reelection campaign. Cardano community would decide how many ADA each member of congress should receive regardless of all parties to help them engage directly in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Currently, music streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) have incredible financial power over the music industry, as they are the conduit between musicians and their listeners. 
Building an NFT marketplace, catered towards music sales, on the Cardano network--the best network in the crypto industry--will allow musicians, bands, rappers, DJs, and so on, to sell their music directly to fans at a fraction of what it costs them to do so through streaming platforms.
Both music artists and music fans around the globe would benefit from this greatly -- finally removing power out of big tech companies' hands.

Today, there are few resources for people who want to learn about Cardano and start developing and growing their local communities, especially in African French-speaking countries, starting from Burkina Faso. However, the international Language Consult( ILC) has similar training programs running at Bobo-Dioulasso, the second city after Ouagadougou. For example, when ILC introduced its ""PROGRAMME DE FORMATION EN COMPETENCES DIGITALES (Avec Anglais come langue d'instruction),"" there was a hunger from local youth of getting such training programs in the community. The program has been a great success. ILC would like to incorporate blockchain technology in its programs, and Cardano would be a great candidate for a new training program.

Delegators currently receive ADA rewards for delegation, but do not receive any proceeds of Stakepool business operations. 
 
This project aims to provide Stakepools with simple smart contracts for NFT sales, which provide an adjustablee % of sales to delegators. 
 
Via this mechanism, delegators become more invested in the success of their Stakepool, and have a chance to earn continuous rewards based on sales performance. 
 
This could be applied to ongoing payments like royalties as well, and the code could also be modified to target specific NFT holders.

Currently the state of stock exchanges is centralized which can result in major issues. Centralization leads to ""having a single point of failure, a possible performance bottleneck or susceptibility to attacks and [is] time consuming. Furthermore, the central authority charges a fees and there is a lack of transparency of the auctioning process for the trader"" (Bhandarkar). When I think of how current stock exchanges need revisions I think of Robinhood.
 
The envisioned state would be digitized tokens of shares of stock (or equity tokens) which could be easily traded between buyers and sellers. ""By decentralizing the system, there is no central authority or intermediate needed for placing and executing the orders. This allows peer-to-peer transfer of stocks and direct buy and sell of equities between the traders without a need of third party to intermediate the trade. This reduces the transaction cost occurred on each trade, time needed for transaction would be significantly reduced and provides enhanced security as well as transparency"" (Bhandarkar). Transactions and trades would be near instant, get rid of the middleman, lower fees, and increase security. I only see benefits to creating a system like this and think Cardano is the perfect blockchain to create a technology like this on. With smart contracts this will definetely be possible on the blockchain and could massively alter and improve the entire way people trade stocks. This method is complete peer-to-peer trading. This wouldn't be replacing today's systems, simply another option people can use.

We are working on CodeUpBlood.com, an online platform that connects blood donors to blood recipients in critical need for blood. It was launched recently. However, we have decided to upgrade the platform (https://codeupblood.com) with smart contracts on the Blockchain network in order to track the entire blood donation supply chain processes, which will be from the blood donation to transfusion. Thus we intend to develop this project on the Cardano Blockchain Network. The technical dependencies of this project will include the following:
1. Web Application
2. Smart Contracts
3. Wallets
4. Data Parsing Service (Python)
5. JavaScript
6. Cardano Blockchain
7. Crypto and Cash (Fiat Money) Payments Executions
The Project Model, TimeLine and Budget can be found via the following links respectively

Currently NFTs are sold on the secondary market with nothing more than the trust that it is authentic and not forged.  Sure you can do some research and find if the piece is authentic or a copy, but many users either don't know how to go about doing this or aren't aware they can be scammed.  With this project we create a COA on the blockchain that is for any particular NFT or actual physical item.  Through the chain of ownership an item can be verified all the way back to the original owner or creator to insure authenticity.  The COA would include all identifiers needed to describe the piece, every change of ownership and the price at time of sale, and can also have a current appraisal price along with the name of the appraisor attached anytime the piece is appraised.  This COA system can also be applied to physical items such as sports memorabilia, collectibles, antiques, movie props, etc., the list is endless.

The current state of project is pre-seed and the current team is made up of a Founding CEO and a recently hired CTO. We have written a white paper written from an economics standpoint. We are looking for a seed investment of £250,000. Utilising this capital we will make the necessary core team hires; COO, CMO and an Economic advisor. We will begin fully planning implementation and creating a technical summary. Additionally marketing materials will be created for our crowdfunding campaign, which we hope to launch 3-4 months after our seed investment. We will allocate ~7.5% of our Centia supply to a CAFE offering (convertible note) via fairmint.co. We aim to raise $2 million crowdfunding continuously utilising this strategy over a 12 month period. Utilising $2 million we will have the capital to build a fully functioning MVP and the necessary funds for a marketing and PR campaign promoting entrepreneurial adoption and the liquidity to make our IEX offering for Centia launching the protocol to the public. When we launch we aim to already have early commitments from entrepreneurs building early applications on our protocol.

The current state is more expensive than it has to be. The housing market will gravitate towards smart contracted escrow accounts, and that is a savings which will make it easier for people to own homes. There are many other reasons people would use an escrow account.
People could sell anything and the specific criteria would have to be met and verified before the purchase could be finalized. People would use escrow more often for more purchases online, which makes the world run more smoothly.
The process of buying a home, or anything else for that matter, can be simplified by taking out the middle man in the equation.
Cardano finding its way into the current housing market to better it would be an overall good thing.
It will make it more affordable for people trying to get out of renting and into a house.

As it stands now, these are some reasons why blockchain technology is needed for elections in Nigeria:
1. Some politicians/political parties arm the youths with guns and weapons to unleash mayhem on members of opposing parties to intimidate people to vote for their own party and in cases where these armed youths realise that they are not going to win at a particular voting centre/location, they shoot in the air to disperse the crowd then destroy election materials or take them away.
2. The need for people to leave their homes to travel far to vote will be overcomed. 
3. Vote buying (this is when politicians induce votes to vote for them on election day with gift items/food or sometimes cash) will be a thing of the past as each voters will be at home without the need for them to gather at a place for inducement.
4. The use of under aged children can also be eliminated. 
5. The cost of conducting elections will be brought down drastically to the bearest minimum. 
6. Most importantly, the manipulation and tampering of election results will automatically become history since there would not be any opportunity to tamper the blockchain. 
7. And finally, the results will be obtained in real time.
So utilising blockchain solves a lot of problems associated with election malpractices in Nigeria. The major issue that might arise in carrying out this project would be lettimg everyone within the voting age to have a digital identity that will be used during voting.

At the moment it seems to me that some members have a lot of ideas. That is good. But if there is no limit on the amount of proposals that one can put forward the quality of proposals will decline substantially.
 
Today I participated on the voting process and there are a lot of proposals. Some of them, in my view, are the same but proposed by different people, with different ways to explain it. Others are borderline outrageous on the problems that want to tackle and the advancing solutions.
 
In my view, if limits per member are imposed, members that want to submit their ideas will have time to meditate about them, discuss with other members and will be able to communicate better with the rest of community. They will have the time to think about the problems they want to solve and the solutions they envision to implement.
 
Without limits, quantity over quality will be the norm. And this gives an extra incentive to bad actors or freeloaders to submit a lot of proposals, maximising their chances of receiving funds.

These node will utilize satellite communication to communicate the ledger across the globe. The nodes will be self sufficient buoys that utilized wake current to power it's operation; ( the system will use a magnetic chamber attached to the ocean to power using the wake of the ocean current to power its entire network using eco friendly energy tactics. ). This information can be utilized to study the ocean using a series of sensors this information can become very useful for tracking and monitoring weather patterns found through the coastline. This information can be sent to news outlets to better predict natural disasters such as hurricanes. By using the scalability of NANO currency's ledger this can be done with low power consumption.

Currently, we have no standard governance primitives.
Currently, we have no modular elements capable of constructing valid DAOs.  The DAO ecosystem is largely based on good will, committee, powerpoints, and sparse, disconnected, smart contracts if any exist at all.
As a community, we need to define governance primitives that allow for:
1. Explicit scope of governance.  Defined actors, direction of activity, transparent activation of governance functions.
2. Construction of large, connected, distributed governance systems and modular governance.

In it's current state, I see no available tools to integrate Cardano with Unity3D. Game development will be of particular interest with NFTs and smart contracts around the corner. One possible integration method that I think would be a quick win for the ecosystem, is to integrate Yoroi and Unity Web games using a plugin. 
I personally have worked on something similar to bridge Unity Web Games with Metamask for Ethereum.  As Yoroi updates come out, they expect to be similar to MetaMask for Ethereum. Since this is the case, there may be an easy gap that my team can fill. By filling this gap, we will not only bring more developers to Cardano, but will also encourage more developments to integrate further beyond just Unity Web Games.
The expected outcome of this proposal would be a Unity Plugin that integrates with Yoroi through a javascript api. This plugin would allow users to do the following when playing a game:
1. sign into their Cardano wallet
2. check their ADA balance as well as other Native Token Balances.
3. check their addresses for any matching NFTs for the game they are playing.
4. once the NFT is verified, the player would unlock whatever the developers tied the NFT ownership to. This could be playable characters, upgrades, or any other digital asset.
While this solution isn't something that will integrate mobile apps built in Unity, I think it's a great start. This will also attract other developers to help build the tools we need for gaming in the future.
 
Funding would be used to assess the feasibility of the solution using the current tools described above. An initial search, shows that Emurgo has a dApp connector for Yoroi that would be used for this case but the dApp conector is in a current nightly version(Yoroi = 4.5.7002 and dapp-connector = 0.4.0).  In addition it seems like a project in fund 5 is proposing to build a connector and they did work on this emurgo connector. This would be perfect timing to use this upcoming connector for a Unity Plugin.
Continued Funding would be used to build the Unity plugin using the dApp connector and make it public to Unity Game Developers. Advanced funding could be used to add features requested by new Cardano Game developers or create more plugins for Mobile Development. It would be nice to build something for Unreal Engine as well since those are the two most popular Game Engines right now.
Expected costs depends on the state of the dApp connector and the exact functionality provided or If the feasibility assessment reveals there are other tools that can be used in place of the dApp connector.

Right now, there is a large upswell of hostility on social media concerning systems development on Cardano. Meanwhile, there is tangible leaps of development also happening in Ethereum that must be acknowledged for their efficacy, especially onboarding efforts.
After seeing this sort of behavior, I believe that there is a list of use cases, by entity, that satisfies the onboarding use case, namely:
Rabbithole.gg (checklist reward system for basic introductory participation in application layer)
scaffold.eth (github repository for a plethora of boilerplate framework for fast implementation of prototypes)
BrightID/Proof of Humanity (sybil resistance/ p2p dID implementation , i.e. cross-party barcode scans with strict limits on authenticity per registration mechanism)
Polymarket (betting market with a twitter account managed by a drunk/otherwise impaired intern)
Olympus DAO (reserve currency that is NOT pegged to any fiat currency, but still maintains price above a threshold)
MetaCartel (like Catalyst, a DAO that invests in application layer)
OpenSea/Rarible/Superrare/etc. (NFT marketplaces)
other DAOs with collective ownership over traditional commercial niches like content creation, land management, intellectual property, gated communities, etc.
I could go on and on.

There is a big problem for all sports fans, the problem that they can simply admire their players or their teams and not actively participate in this industry that moves billions of dollars.
With nft you could afford to own a part of a player's card and earn from his performance.If his card increases in value, those who invested in him by covering nft can earn with him, without being cut off.Buying company/teams NFTs you could vote decisions, participate in profits, have exclusive benefits and much more. A platform should be built on Cardano for the issuance of these NFTs by teams and athletes to allow fans to invest in of them and see the earnings of both sides increase.

Currently elected officials with good intentions cannot govern in a way that eradicates the faults of the Human condition. The Human condition is clan specific and based on a model of evolutionary survival and self interest. This leads to corruption and serving of the clan/friend group before that of the public. 
The solution as I see it is the creation of a decentralised self learning Artificial Intelligence based on the principles of the highest order of Human being, one who has overcome the base desire of the default Human condition, otherwise know as a 'Rose Cross' whom can be found in the 'Invisible College'. This group of mystics should be sought for the inputs of the A.I with a blanace of interest based on Humans the Earth and Animal and plant kingdoms. 
The A.I would need environmental, legal framework, scientific inputs in order to problemsolve. It would require data to project outwards and provide suggestions on actions for local governenace. At the most basic levels it would suggest legal remedies for crimes, environemental and weather actions from suggesting gritters and snow plows to suggesting emergency support in times of drought to carbon and methane reduction plans etc..

There is a gap, I humbly think, between the mental model of any every-day person and interactions with blockchain technology. Specifically, visualizations of smart contract interactions that are easy to understand, interact with, comprehend, easily understand how it applies to a person's life, and visualizes over time what has happened. Experimenting and building interactions that allow users to interact with the smart contract is comprehensive and individual ways helps in adopting the technology.
Visualizations and interfaces in the blockchain area are evolving rapidly. And Dapps, but I also see a gap that could complement the rapid iteration of building particular applications to wide-scale adoption, and that is in how we visualize smart contracts. Working on how the end-user will have an elegant,, but highly usable interface to smart contracts. There is modeling language for visualization for blockchain, but none in the area of Dapps or specifically for the novice, Currently visualizations for blockchain  is applied for development and while that's cool, it is difficult to find interactions that pertain to the mental model of the end user. 
For example, Felix Härer and Hans-Georg Fill write about it  in their research ""A COMPARISON OF APPROACHES FOR VISUALIZING BLOCKCHAINS AND SMART CONTRACTS"" that though we currently have different ways to model blockchain transactions, ledgers, and domain specific modeling languages, they argue that when it comes to smart contract : ""...visual models are presented on the same level of abstraction as technical models."" I agree. They go on to say that in order to allow an understanding by the end user for smart contract technology, ""Visualization by itself is, thus, insufficient. While the reviewed design approaches might be appropriate for technical development processes, and while the analysis approaches might provide insight when conducting targeted investigations, their broader applicability in domains outside of technical fields is limited.""
Given this gap, I think it will be a large impediment to wide-scale adoption. But, ever optimistic, I would like very much to propose that smart contracts CAN BE visualized in a manner that is eloquent, easy-to-underand, and powerful. 
The gap I currently have is at a project level and needing support to accomplish this (if it is useful). The first use case is a Garden | Climate Journal application. Wireframes and specifications are complete, and I can organize user testing but do not know how to go about development and need resources and help. Also, the first project is very much focused on visualizing smart contracts to the mental model of an every-day person for the purpose of helping people interact with nature, trade, sell, barter food in any way they want and easily show this in a smart contract. Testing often with every-day people, whether or not this is working well as a smart contract visualization, modifying, and iterating, etc. in an Agile manner is something I would highly embrace with a development team. The wireframes and specifications are complete, product planning and user testing are not an issue: I am very much struggling with finding developers and funding to make this project happen.

Hi Cardano Developers,
I am interested in bridging todays centralized currencies to the blockchain. Every micro transaction game from fortinite to clash royal has an onboarding ramp from fiat into their centralized proprietary in game currency. I want to build the tools so that these micro transaction game companies will actually adopt so they list game currencies on the blockchain creating an on ramp from their centralized proprietary in game currency to the blockchain and back. From a user experience angle one needs to be able to tell the micro transaction company they want their in game currency transferred to them on the blockchain as soon as possible. 
 
There are existing ways of doing this. You can bundle a bunch of transactions from the day, take them to a cold server over night, sign the transactions, then send them out in the morning. This procedure, though pretty secure, is very cumbersum and negatively effects the customer experience.
 
The transition from centralized proprietary currency to crypto currency needs to be seamless. Give micro transaction game public key, you get crypto in the next 5 minutes, or less. It is one thing to get insurance or something if your hot server holding the minting/token key gets compromised leading to stolen tokens, it is something else entirely giving organizations ability to invalidate transactions within a certain amount of time after minting using a cold key . Executive teams at these micro transaction game companies are not going to get behind a blockchain bridge if the hot server can be compromised leading to damages, too much risk. The ability to detect incorrect minting and nullify transactions within a specified time frame, say 72 hours, using a cold private key is something these executive teams could get on board with.
Now for the technical side of thing...
If one were to mint a centralized currency via a bridge to Cardano could one invalidate transactions and have them tracked via UTxO. Let's say a micro transaction game wants to list their currency on a Dex. They have some API running on their backend that when it receives a request it mints the tokens on the blockchain. Let's say that the hot server minting the tokens gets compromised and then a bunch of tokens are minted by the attacker and sent to hundreds of different addresses. Would it be possible to have a offline wallet sign a transaction that would invalidate any transactions signed by the hot wallet after a specific block and then sign a new hot wallet? What I just described is just a centralized proprietary cryptocurrency with extra steps the key value proposition would be that the ability to nullify transactions only exists for a specific (period of time/number of blocks) after minting. We could even have it so the cold wallet can sign away its ability to mint or reduce the amount of time transactions are allowed to be invalidated. 
Is this part of Extended UTxO or would it have to be a smart contract?

First, I'm Les, I've owned 2 Italian restaurants in Toronto from 1999-2017. Im a Chef by trade. This idea has been lingering around my head as a project for the 2 years. A fast food chain mostly in the malls and airports and universaries, obviously accepting ADA as a POS system that will take us to limitless boundaries in the HOSPITALITY Industry. But the concept is also about giving back and a goal of having 1 Store location in a pastability (get it) dedicated for free for the hunger especially runaway kids. The technology will be behind the machines running on our blockchain like cooking time in a belt line to mass produce and but with a quality by ***Chef CARDANILO (Cardano Blockchain).*** Hardly any food cost considering its most operated by technology supervised by a handful of staff. The trick is having quality Pasta in about under 3-4 minutes prepared by the blockchain. I will be  one of the Chef that will monitor recipes which will have a base factory in the major Cities. Payments By ADA in shoppings malls. And hopefully get into producing wine by Cardano Wineries. The chain part I already seen that is 1000% practical. It's the finding the community I lack and funding . I can elaborate more once we can have a community behind it.  And NO one, especially kids suffer from hunger! Knowing. Pardon me for lacking in the building the community and where to get started in this Project imputing, I'm just learning daily as I read to where to get started and reaching out.

SUPER ADA, ADA Power's the Kids! With our CTM's Cardanano ATM's ( Cardano Teller Machines and POS systems. 
Yes, let's try to promote it, I was born In the Philippines, I grew up there as a kid and my part not even a poor neighborhood, but we relied on the neighborhood corner store and half of the quarter of the community didn't even have a phone so they would use the phone there as well for .25 cents a call. Now going back to the CTM (Cardano Teller Machines) we will call it, imagine an ATM that doesn't have to really on cash and no partnership with any banks the you can walk to with no shoes and (most of these people really on remittance money from family members abroad, so all they need let say is a pin and will be able to print a ticket tag with ADA that their family member sent them, it's their physical ticket of their crypto, now they can cash use this at the corner store it self where they can buy goods maybe and the stores will have a POS system. Now we just save them all the middle men fees from remittance company who takes big chunks of commission, we provided a flow of hope amd economy, with no technical or mobile phones, like I said even without shoes, to revive their remittance crypto. Now back to the machine, let's make it able for people to put in cash and buy ADA or any crypto by depositing cash, now you have a cash flow option of giving out cash as well , though the goal is to eliminate cash but still has the option, now we don't need to really on any one filling up the machine or picking up cash, if it's needed we can deal with that later on. Assuming that one day we will all retailers with POS systems that takes payments in crypto right, it's coming. Now all we need is the CTM's, now do we promote it to the stores for free or do we charge for it or like now, people have to ask and rent it to have in their stores, we can figure that out later eventually, the point is a mass access for poor or rich with no difficulty of ADA token, buy food or anything eventually. This is something i was very much thinking about this machines. We can also ask for support from the govt where, 3rd world countries, where my concern is the kids and human trafficking and runaways and just so poor, to be able to go it with their birth certificate number or some kind of system of identity to be able to withdraw, like a charity or baby bonus of as little as $2 worth of ADA for food. Some of these kids turn into prostitution because of desperation for food, I would be so glad if we can save or help 1 person, never mind all but a few would be great for us all. I thought of that here from Canada, kids we get an allowance from the govt monthly, baby bonus, what if we can get some kind of a system where any desperate lost soul can somehow borrow or be able to receive a LITTLE in time of desperation's from our CTM machines, and yes, maybe demand a little from the government's to pay up or help out the least. But there's more function but this is the least and priorities for now.

I also think that the Cosmos chain has capitalized on the key insight that there is a need for problem specific chains (this allows for scalability, specialization, and decentralization). Cardano has already taken great strides towards interoperability with the ERC-20 converter, I think that integrating with ""The internet of blockchains"" would be another worthwhile endeavor in this direction.

Currently there is a fund that gets spread out after voting has been completed and is spread evenly amongst those who have registered and submitted votes. By implementing a per vote reward, all proposals in Project Catalyst will potentially have a more incentivized approach to not only be viewed but also weighed and voted on.

Coastal communities practicing artisanal fishing (or traditional / subsistence fishing) in the UNESCO World Heritage site of Sanganeb Marine National Park and Dungonab Bay – Mukkawar Island Marine National Park in the Red Sea coast of Sudan have limited abilities and/or alternatives to address overfishing and the gradual depletion of fish stocks in their fishing areas.
Poverty and lack of structured management practices of fishing areas that are accessible to coastal fishermen (shallows and reef fishing) has locked the fishing communities of the two villages falling in the marine national park in a vicious downward spiral of declining fish stocks and increased poverty.
The proposed solution will create/develop an incentive mechanism (based on blockchain and Cardano) for fishermen in the two villages of the Marine Protected Area to develop and adopt zoning plans for their fishing grounds that ensure species being fished (and under duress) are given the time to replenish and increase in stock whilst at the same time contribute to improving the livelihoods of the fishermen.
When the solution is developed and proven to work, it will serve as a model which can be upscaled and replicated to serve other coastal communities in the developing world who are struggling with this same problem.

We are all aware of the flaws that plague the healthcare industry. We have made little to no stride in this space. Those with no coverage pay out of pocket or simply go untreated. Another failed system accepted by society across the globe. 
Open-source Medicine:  Cost of medications stabilizes and becomes available to all. No co-pay, prior authorization, just medicine simplified.  This is not just from a pharmaceutical perspective. In-patient, out patient, and diagnostic services included. 
What does one do when the wheel is not the most practical way of moving ? Add more wheels?  
This would distribute wealth to across the block-chain. In essence for those who would elect to give up an antiquated legacy system and usher in change would be rewarded by a privacy first, patient first, policy. One they can trust because all but their data would be open and available on the block chain. 
Current systems such as HL7 can be integrated then dismantled. If you want to travel over-sees your data and history is with you always. Controlled by any number of functions i.e. time lock read-only, edit or share functions all controlled by the owner. 
Currently diagnostic imaging uses a Modality to make a .dcm image loaded with patient data (CT scan can be over 1000 images all of which hold private data) -> next it gets sent to a router, relay, load balancer, and finally if nothing fails it lands at a netgate to be compressed into a digestible format so that a reading radiologist who, may or may not be in the same location can sit up look at the .dcm and dictate opinion. These images are stored locally to be recalled at any time for any use with or without the permission of the patient. At any point in the process these images can be copied, stored and taken away without repercussion.
Could we not mint 1-of-1 NTF's and use wallets as custody to maintain a level of privacy and control unlike ever before?

The only reason I found out about Cardano is because I searched for green crypto (PoS).  Many people will only look at BTC, ETH or DOGE as options to invest in as new investors, simply because they have heard the names before and simply put, they don't cast much thought to the environmental concerns over PoW.  
Educating users on types of coins/tokens, and then onto the initiatives and platforms of crypto can only help the crypto community at large by helping the general public see that crypto isn't just another form of gambling, but the platforms and applications of crypto such as Cardano are extremely useful for society. 
How can we achieve this?  How does anything grab the attention of the public eye?  By doing things that regular people are looking at, not just things that crypto investors / platform developers are looking at.  Normalising cryptocurrency at the most basic level.
What sort of things can put Cardano into the view of the public eye?
- Funding a film or series about the life of Augusta Ada King with ADA.
- Cardano can be (and is) marketed as a green platform - We can use this to fund green initiatives around the world
- Teaming up with other platforms to complete tasks that are difficult to execute alone (contributing to the tackling of societal problems like the current economic crises faced by young people today)

There is a significant delay in the time between when Community Advisors and Veteran Community Advisors make their contributions and when incentive reward payments are distributed. In the case for CA's in reviewing fund 5, this is up to two months from when reviews opened.
The information required to evaluate whether the contributions are valid is available from the end of the VCA period. This is an example where a smart contract, once fed the requisite information on valid contributions could conduct the random allocation and send payments.
Is there a good reason for the decision to delay these further? Perhaps the initial decision on linking the timeline of rewards payments to project payments was made in earlier rounds when the review and voting process was more compressed?
Cardano obviously understands the time value of money hence all the effort that has gone into providing the infrastructure for staking.
If these were paid at the VCA completion date, the rewards would also be able to be used for voting.
As the rewards are denominated in USD, but paid in ADA, it also increases exposure to exchange rate volatility in both ADA/USD and their native currency/USD for the intervening 1 month period.
This is not an expectation of change in the current round, just a suggestion on design on timing going forward.

There are a limited number of participants in project catalyst. Forcing participants to only on one side or the other is limiting. Whilst there are obvious issues in allowing proposers to asses their own or competing projects, the current restrictions are probably too severe and could be loosened with appropriate safeguards.
One simple solution could be to allow proposers to be Community Advisor's (and Veteran Community Advisor's) in all challenges other than the one's they have made proposals in.
As members likely have experience in the areas in which they have made proposals, it may also be useful to let them asses projects in the same challenge. This obviously raises issues of bias, fairness and potential malicious assessing. Perhaps an extra flag for these assessments to be approved as valid by an unbiased Veteran Community Advisor (ie a VCA who does not have a proposal in that challenge)?

The current state of Project Catalyst, is confusing. As Amazing and important as Project Catalyst is, it's not well known. For my solution I propose:
We form Action groups with special skillsets. Each necessary Skill set will be discussed agreed upon once the groups are formed. These groups will contain members each meeting a specific skill set necessary to evaluate the current proposal. Groups for each proposal will be picked at random to evaluate portions of proposals. Once Evaluated by each group member is performed, they vote and then the proposal goes on public display with all the proposers research in hand. At his point it's open for further public improvements or votes. Once it has gone through the process of evaluations, I will make a YouTube video showing and explaining the project and what teams evaluated it. The evaluations will bring attention to the space. We will invite others to vote on the proposal as well. Proposals that are awarded funding through this evaluation process, are rewarded by the treasury, as well as the CA's who evaluated it. This will help create a positive feedback loop for the evaluators efforts.
Each project contains a ""Success Bounty"": This consist of three phases of success. Each phase has a rewards value if reached successfully.
Phase one: successful vote accumulations resulting in funding. (1st smallest predetermined reward to CA's involved in the evaluation and dissemination of project information.)
Phase two completion of the project upon the schedule it was estimated or projected (ranges of acceptability will be discussed). (2nd reward on scale of delivery of successful project on time, close, better late than never) On time pays most and scales down to a minimal amount, not zero, effort should be rewarded.
Phase three a pre-decided success value this project offers to the network. did the project in some way increase the x+y=z, this will be discussed per project during evaluation, this will be the highest reward as this result is our Alpha result, a successful project working on the network. This will complete the success bounty cycle.
As projects vary greatly each evaluation will include the ""Success Value"" this value through the process of its evaluation. Each phase will increase in rewards, this will promote tracking and updates on projects. The Potential is great for this arena, we must create a symbiotic relationship between proposers, evaluators and the outcome (funded or not). This means proposers are motived to get funds by the work and future prospects of their proposal. Evaluators CA's, will be motivated to evaluate projects worth funding and get rewarded for that effort and following success of that funding.
Proposals that do exceptionally well offer a bonus to evaluators (CA's) and a reputation NFT. I can make some CA's evaluator NFT tokens. CA's can compete for these and when enough are collected can be turned in for funding private projects or tuned in for (items to be discussed later). These NFT's will be rewards for quality work yielding projects that enhanced our system. The criteria for that will be determined by the groups who evaluate the proposal, as each proposal will have different attributes that may not translate across multiple uses cases. This will be a dynamic process that over time will grow and enforce an evaluation protocol for projects that yield higher probability for success.

This would close decades of the underserved children and young adults who's lives could go in a much better direction. This would empower kids in a system that is broken. Most of these kids live in bags. Don't have funding for clothes, shoes, school supplies, health care, this would cut through to sponsor a foster child by Donating directly to their blockchain wallets. We would upload info about the child you sponsored. Teach them about blockchain early. Teach a whole generation of kids that fall through the system. This could go nationwide. This could change the lives of many. This would have changed my life. I want to give something back, leave this world with a legacy to help those who have suffered like myself. These kids can do great things with your help. Please give me a chance, give them a chance, when the deck is already stacked against them.

A Cardano-wallet-seed it should always restore the same wallet, no matter if you use Daedalus, Ledger, Trezor, AdaLite or Yoroi. Therefore the derivation path for key generation has to be standardized.
Right now this is NOT the case. You just get a different empty wallet. The end user is scared and will loose trust in the Cardano system. This is a serious incompatiblity issue and needs to be solved.
SOLUTION suggestion: 
- New Cardano-wallet: key generation should done that the seed is compatible with any Cardano-software/hardware wallet and is always pointing to the same wallet. This requires a joint venture with all wallet developers. So far, I believe that only Ledger and Trezor need to do any changes, everything else seems to be in sync, but it needs to be verified.
- if the user restores a Cardano-wallet, the key generation should be done by default as above, but the user must have an option like ""restore from older wallet version"" and the wallet is restored the old way. Or the system automatically searches for a non-empty Cardano-wallet.
The competitors have this compatibility: It works perfect with every hardware or software Ethereum-wallet.

The Ministry of Health with a budget of $10 million dollars runs a fragmented health service delivery ; lacks institutional capacity for policy-making, regulation, coordination, planning, management and contracting; and does not have use of data in decision-making. Most if not all 15 million Somalis living in Somalia do not have any government issued electronic or paper health records or vital records such as a birth certificates and medical records. Less than 30% of the Somali population have access to health services. The neonatal mortality rate is 40 deaths per 1000 live births and the under-5 mortality rate is 137 deaths per 1000 live births. The maternal mortality rate is estimated at 732 per 100 000 live births. The use of family planning remains low, resulting in high fertility rates. Only 11% of children receive the basic vaccinations needed to protect them from common childhood illnesses such as measles and polio, for which the world has long had the technical solutions to defeat. Just a third of children are born with the services of a skilled midwife, nurse or doctor and one in twenty women aged fifteen today will die of pregnancy and birth related complications.
Private health services, NGOs, and the pharmaceutical sector are largely unregulated in Somalia. Health services are delivered through a poorly regulated and uncoordinated network of NGOs and the private sector, the health sector grapples with chronic shortfalls in capacity, infrastructure and medical personnel. Funding for the health sector comes from international donors and is 'off-budget'.
The creation of a health insurance company (Health Maintenance Organization or HMO) using contributions (small set aside) from remittances sent to Somalia will help rebuild the fragmented healthcare system. Annually $1.6 billion is sent by the Diaspora, if 1% or $16 million for example was pooled to create this HMO with facilities and personnel, the recipients of remittances will have access to health care in a country where the Ministry of Health has an annual budget less than $10 million for the entire country.
The UN and NGOs have for the last few years convened meetings and initiatives examining ways to move their engagement in Somalia from a humanitarian to development focus. Both the UN and various NGOs have for the over 30 years provided humanitarian aid to Somalia. As the country is becoming more stable these organizations are working with the government to find ways to address the sustainability of programs and services, they have funded post humanitarian aid by providing technical assistance to federal, state and local institutions.
The World Bank through its initiative - the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) is spearheading efforts with the World Health Organization and Somalia's Ministry of Health to introduce Universal Health Coverage for Somalia's population. Through these discussions, the partnership has addressed the many issues facing Somalia's national health care system and the need for private sector intervention. [GFF, is a country-led global partnership committed to ensuring all women, children and adolescents can survive and thrive.]
There will be start up costs associated with this endeavor of course which would be worthwhile if UN and NGOs contributed by enrolling those they serve. Our high-level plans to engage the UN and NGOs for support include sharing our project as a tangible strategy to putting into action their aspiration of phasing out humanitarian aid for the country by showing them a side-by-side cost-benefit analysis at the micro and macro levels (i.e., overall current national health care situation and examples of enrolling their patients in our health insurance program versus what they are currently offered). In addition, our health insurance program will help meet the priority areas identified in both the Somali National Development Plan for 2019–2024 and the Somali Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Roadmap, launched in September 2019. Both plans identify primary health care as the main approach to improving health outcomes in the country. The government of Somalia, multilateral and bilateral partners have identified 5 priorities for enhanced collaboration to accelerate progress towards UHC which include: 1) Establishment of a health coordination mechanism, 2) Improving access to a package of high-quality essential health services, 3) Strengthening emergency preparedness and response through UHC, 4) Strengthening the role and capacity of the Ministry of Health, and 5) Harnessing the private sector for UHC. This endeavor will not only close the access gap but it will give patients enrolled a record (birth certificate, medical record, etc.) and also health care providers and facilities a way to be rated, accredited and credentialed.
Although funding from the Catalyst Project will not completely sustain the initiation, planning, execution, and evaluation of our project it will give us the credibility by serving as a launchpad. This funding will help support the initiation and planning phases of our project lifecycle.

ECT's (Environmental Contribution Tokens)
Current state:
increasing environmental problems.
current negative public view on blockchain energy problems. 
Need to enlarge the possibility's of blockchain technology for creating a more sustainable world.
Need to increase the adoption of Cardano.
Future state:
With offering ECT's and creating an ECT platform Cardano can be again a pioneer for solving environmental problems, we can  pace up with solving environmental problems and scaling up massively current environmental restoring projects on a transparent and measurable way.
Solving environmental problems like the plastic waist in the oceans, the disappearing of the amazon rainforest, building decent sewage systems in developing countries, building Solar projects throughout the world, accessibility for fresh drinking water in developing countries etc. . In an direct transparent way with strong fixed conditions for the participating organisations , easy to follow, easy to measure. 
ECT platform and Creating Value:
With ECT's people can buy a limited token on the ECT platform. Through voting for several environmental projects on an open platform people can choose the project they want to support with buying an ECT (environmental contribution token) on a transparent and lively platform. 
We can create more value to the token besides the social and environmental aspects through collaborating with some known NFT artist which will create a limited edition piece of art added to the ECT, this will make this ECT also an NFT with added value. This will create a new NFT market/economy for Cardano with ETC tokens designed by famous artists.Creating a win-win-win-win situation, for the token holder, the environment, the artist and off course helping Cardano forward.
Involved organisations must be fully transparent about spendings.
Must deliver timeframe/plan.
Every project must be possible to be followed through live streams, media updates, video contents etc.
Every step and development can be monitored by the contributor any time.

Right now crypto and sports are not involved with each other. Once involved with sports Cardano can become a household name even sooner. My idea is take a specific league. Lets say the NFL. There are 32 teams so you will make 32 different types of tokens for each team. You can have the value for the token go up for the teams that win and when a team loses their token will decrease. If people buy coins of a heavily favored team like the Chiefs against a bad team like the Jets. You will have the majority of the people purchase chiefs tokens. Lets say 10k of Chiefs tokens were bought and only 5k worth of Jets. Since the majority is on the Chiefs if the Chiefs win they can split a percentage from the 5k from the Jets value lets say 10%. Now if the Jets upset the Chiefs the 10k from the chiefs coins will be 10% of the 10k making the reward higher. This will basically be the stock/crypto version of gambling with their teams coin price dictated by how well their team does every Sunday.

What gap? New to this so ....JUST SOME IDEAS. (""create in one blockchain and sell it on another"")
NFTs are a ""scam"". But the huge demand can not be denied.
NFTs have value only in context. (ex. Some Game Platform). They will exist only as long as the platform exists. Real Context provide authentication of the creation, what is happening now on ethereum etc...= real scam.
+There is a great demand of artists to protect their work using blockchain. But there is no CONTEXT for CNFTs (like ArtNFT, HouseNFT etc).
Some Context atributes ?:
- authority to establish author, until challenged, and provide some proof of author
- provide art search for duplicates, Google & AI might help
- responsibility of the author = personal public data, personal responsibility for his public declarations and art attribution. A third party, official, is needed as authenticator. The creator must take responsibility, in real world with authenticated signature. Requires some digital signature, provided by some government (directly or not). This signature must have insurance (from the emitter of the signature) and must cover all damages if the person is not who he say). Some corrupt governments might try to sell identities. Not all government (or !?) should be ok to provide ""identity"", in some period of time in history.
- free to use for the artist (but transactions fees will be many in the blockchain, take small amounts of money when the art work sells – smart contracts). Art creation and protection must always be free for the author, he is creating value not store value.
- global (in the local-blockchain) rules, not depending on other laws of any state.
- small picture with the overall look (maybe SVG 50kb) to store in the blockchain as metadata if possible or other form of cloud? If cloud dissapear only the physical art object will survive. So selling a virtual art work must provide to the buyer some proof of creation and selling (material or not?). How big this data base can get?
- maybe provide a Crypto domain (better subdomain?) URL (to be sold in the same time with the art work for ever). How to solve 500years Hosting?
Problems:
Maybe 50kb in the blockchain and a hash adr. will do?
Some specialized art blockchain need it?
How to see if the item is not on other blockchains? One Common Global Database for all CNFT?
Different blockchains types for music, paintings, digital art, official physical objects selling?
AI is a must?
If the CREATION (of the CNFT) PROBLEM is solved then it is easy, so …. create on one blockchain and sell it on another. ""Create"" part involves third party insurance and must be free. Not like todays brands, patents  etc. If you don't have the money some thief will register your idea, your work, you r invention etc.
In land sales is much easier. All land ""belongs"" to the government, and it is the only authority that must implement a blockchain technology to store documentation for the owners. Then the selling is done with one authenticated signature that has the right (according to land_blockchain) to do so in any blockchain with any cryptocoin. Taxes are paid with smart contracts.
To extrapolate for nfts … maybe an COPYRIGHT EXPERT will set lite into this matter.
I look forward to hear about some NFT implementation in Cardano.

About voteme 
Currently music fans buy concert tickets after a promoter has booked the artists, they have no say in which artist comes to perform or when.  Our platform is designed to give music fans the ability to create live concerts by voting for the artist that they want to see perform.  Voteme provides fans with a unique ability to chose
This voting is done by the purchase of a security token. We provide artists with unique security tokens that is valued based on the average price of their concert tickets. 1 token is equal to 1 concert ticket, For example if the average retail price of an artist's concert ticket is 65$ then the artist's token is valued at 65$
We also provide artists with a marketplace where they can sell their tokens at a wholesale price, giving fans and retail investors an opportunity to buy and sell with the aim of using or earning a profit. 
 
This opens the market as fans in any country in the world can book an artist instead of waiting for a promoter who is limited by geography. 
 
We are currently in talks with SONY music to create a partnership that allows us to build digital assets for artists
Just as holders of ADA token can decide to vote for this project as the best project for ADA, We want to also give music fans all over the world the ability to do the same with music artists.

Prior to Uber, the taxi industry was dominated by companies. Some large, some small, but in most places there existed choices. The truly savvy individual could run their own taxi and charge slightly less but keep all their profit. There were hybrid situations where people rented taxis and then ran their own business.  When Uber came along and desensitized people to the idea of riding in a strangers car, suddenly people could work for themselves when they wanted to. People who traditionally wouldn't be driving t taxi full time now could at their leisure work part-time for some much-needed income.  Initially, people thought it was a good thing that there were no more taxi companies and people could get a taxi when they wanted and often-times cheaper. Then Uber got greedy and began taking larger amounts from people with fees and less pay per mile.  Combined with some economic down-turns and suddenly people are working forty plus hours per week but still struggling.
The problem now is because everybody pretty much uses Uber or Lyft there is no more competition for prices and it's the hard-working drivers who are losing out.  You can't work for yourself because people rarely think to flag a taxi down when it's so convenient to use a ride-sharing app.  The average rider just wants to feel safe and get to their destination as quickly and as cheaply as possible. The average driver just wants to earn a fair wage and not get cheated when they are doing all the work.
There needs to be a way where competition is brought back to the market and people once again have a choice. Decentralized finance is taking over the world and its time we bring that same community management to ride-sharing. Getting in a stranger's personal car should be as should be a transaction between that person and the rider. I want to create an ecosystem where ride-share drivers can make money, save money, borrow money, and exchange money.

Cryptocurrencies go in a contradictory direction in terms of energy reduction, although Cardano is in a very good position of consumption since it consumes less than other cryptocurrencies, 6 gigawatt hours of energy (Source Forbes). We can realize or return this energy, with renewable energy, we could also generate a circular economy as the Staking Pools could benefit from this model where it would have a certification and also a refund in ADA part of the energy consumption it has. In addition in the areas where these renewable energies would be installed would be places where they have a high population decline because they go to the big city, thus generating employment in these populations.

Examples of these health problems are allergies, asthma, the spread of respiratory infections, and cancer. Research shows that there are chemicals in building materials that make occupants sick.
 
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, ""On average, we spend about 90 percent of our time indoors, where pollutant levels are often higher than those outside. Indoor pollution is estimated to cause thousands of cancer deaths and hundreds of thousands of respiratory health problems each year. In addition, hundreds of thousands of children have experienced elevated blood lead levels resulting from their exposure to indoor pollutants"".
 
As stated by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, ""The average person spends 65 percent of their entire life inside their home. Your home is your health. It's that simple"".
 
Multiply your age by .90, and that is how many years you have spent indoors. Then multiply your age by .65, and that is how my years you have spent in your home.
 
Per the National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine, ""The built environment can promote healthy environments and behaviors, as well as mitigate adverse health outcomes. Air quality, social equity, community cohesion, physical safety, transportation choices, traffic-related crashes, water quality, access to healthy foods, physical activity levels, access to nature, and daylight levels all influence public health.""

Cardano are too ""nerdy"" for regular people :)
Realize this when my 11yr old are asking what coding is, so I give her the web to try haskell https://tryhaskell.org/ . Soon realize that although it's fun, it is too ""nerdy"" and lack of fun to stay more than 30 minutes doing it and try to understand the real life case of using it.
We need to develop an easy gaming platform - that children and their parents can play with while learning about Cardno and the functional codes of haskell and it's impact to the real world.  Like marlowe - but  playable, maybe digital board game riddles that you need to solve with haskell? a random NFT generator to create a funny characters for the family? or just a secret encrypted letters using sort or reverse function (my daughter love this function), or other function.. let say dad's grocery list from mom (the dad needs to decode it). 
Mom to Daughter : please send this grocery list to dad
Daughter code reverse at the app result : ""dednirg g002 acibara eeffoc,gk1 taem ,kcap 3 klim""
--text to dad ---
Dad opens and figure out what function code are used, he realize it - find a function code to decode and reply : ""?stiurf emos tnaw uoy od ,ti tog i ko""
 
It should be fun not for the almost ""nerdy"" dad / mom that already onboard on Cardano, but for the whole family as well - the kids even can challenge their friends to solve their encrypted secret letters.

It is estimated that 60-70 percent of americans are aware of bitcoin. There is a dramatic dropoff between bitcoin and the next most commonly known currency, ethereum. Much fewer are aware of cardano, and if cardano were to even reach the awareness of ethereum, I think the project would easily surpass it and make a serious challenge at bitcoin as the most adopted cryptocurrency/blockchain project.

The current state is really blocking the development of the country, the government is not able to provide an identity for the citizens and hence leading to corruption during the national election. Corruption is president at every level and in every field like education, economic and politics 
The expected state will eradicate the corruption and leading to a good governance and empowering the community

I went through many ideas here in IdeaScale (IS) reporting on IS problems and shortcommings and I would like to sum it here and propose how it should work and ask if there is a plan to move in that direction. I am project manager, software architect and engineer so I gave it some thought.
 
Current state:
1. great social dynamics for sharing, discussing and improving ideas/proposals
2. privately owned source code with more clients than just Cardano. This makes it harder to fit the solution for Cardano needs (slow, expensive changes)
3. hard for newbies (currently solved by solutions build separatelly from IS)
4. no statistics, no data aggregation. This is currently solved by floating sheets and tools trying to build on top of IdeaScale (not very successfully)
5. no post-VOTING stage. With each fund more and more proposals are being implemented, but there is no history in IS and it is hard to track what was funded in previous rounds and more importantly to audit and report progress.
6. no mobile app, hard to navigate in mobile responsive version of the web app
7. no linking and grouping proposals
 
Envisioned state:
1. keep the social dynamics and build on it
2. open source code - more people could contribute
3. tooltip walkthrough the system explaining basic concepts and how to move forward in each step of the process for faster onboarding
4. Challenges repeat themselfs in funds and we should be able to track how much funds went into them through multiple funds. They should be separate entities living outside Campaigns and Proposals should be linked to these Challenges. The ""Funds amount"" field should be a property of a Proposal, so we could do this aggregations (how much ADA have we spent on challenge Developer ecosystem so far this year, etc)
5. There should be charts detailing ratio between requested and available funds in a current campaign (fund), funds distribution between challenges in a campaign and many more …
6. Proposals should be grouped in Projects in a way, that Project can have multiple proposals. Projects would be owned by a Team and one user could be part of different teams (working on multiple projects). Some proposals in a Project can be funded, some don't, some in progress, but we would see which Proposals belong toghether to one context and their state.
7. From funded Proposals we could create Projects living in the post-VOTING stage and this could serve as a point of reference for decision making on new proposals by the same team and to track the progress of the Project or proposal and audit it. Additionally, by ""Funds amount"" aggregation we would see how much ADA went into this and that Project or Team so we could see the value we gave and the value we received.
8. Proposals should be linkable between themselfs with a ceratain relationship (relates to/duplicates/… )
8. GraphQL API would be very usefull so other people could easily build on top of this system whatever thay want (by keeping privacy and security) and not be restricted by limiting API structure.
9. Reputation should play important role and it should come from the blockchain (connection to mainnet). Reputation should be visible and probably it should influence how are certain reviews/ratings/opinions weighted
10. Existing mobile app with same features as a web app
11. App localization should be led by the community
12. Advanced search in proposals (filtering not reviewed/not visited/seeks help/amount requested/….)

Currently, short films are a necessity for filmmakers to prove their merit in the industry.  They are economical in their length as well as in their means of production.  They are the official calling card or ""diploma"" filmmakers need to show investors that they have the talent needed to undertake a larger industry project.  Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan, David Lynch, Walt Disney,  Maya Deren, and Denis Villeneuve all started their careers making short films.  However, while this rich and expressive cinematic medium is an essential part of any filmmakers' career, the thousands of short films made every year rarely, if ever, provide a true means of income for the artists making them.  
That may change however with the rise of the NFT.  The NFT has served as an incredible means of providing new and sustainable revenue streams for graphic design artists, but the NFT market has yet to truly tap the film industry.  Feature films in a sense may be too long and cumbersome to collect and showcase, however, the short film would provide endless possibilities for film curators and collectors to amass a unique and one of a kind collection of cinematic art.  These short film NFTs can even serve as a stock exchange of sorts for independent filmmakers looking to fund their next feature project or television series. 
As the program director for the Flickers' Rhode Island International Film Festival and an experimental filmmaker myself, I have worked with thousands of short filmmakers over the years from across the globe, and they seem to always say the same thing: ""never expect to make any money on your short film.""  Well, this might very well be possible now. 
An NFT market ""Short Flicks"" specifically geared towards short filmmakers has the potential to engage the global independent film industry and its supporters in ways that could potentially revolutionize the art of cinema as we know it today.  This could also serve as a means of empowerment for filmmakers living in many parts of the world where it is not possible to have easy access to standard sources of funding for cinematic projects.  Filmmakers in Africa, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, and Nepal would finally have a means of accessing funding for their work, which would lead to more films being produced and more unique stories being told.  
Through empowering the global independent film industry as a whole, this project would not only help to build a more vibrant and dynamic ecosystem for filmmakers to receive funding and exhibit their work worldwide, but also help to further generate exponential exposure for the Cardano network.  Filmmakers are master social influencers by nature after all, and helping them could be just what is needed to further achieve large scale awareness of the benefits of blockchain technology.

Currently countries like my own (Sudan) rely primarily on donations and loans while the country owns natural and human resources capable of making it among the major suppliers of many major products. Lack of identity system, proper investment regulations and spread of corruption as well as the poor infrastructure makes it difficult for the human talents to achieve its full potential and break free from that vicious cycle of poverty. 
Similar to what Muhamad Yunus's Grameen bank has achieved in Bangladesh as well as many countries across the world, Blockchain Reaction (BCR Bank) can achieve these goals by providing an identity system for the underprivileged majority in Africa as a first step, after which provide microfinance for small projects.
Cardano Africa event presented the work done in primarily Ethiopia and Tanzania which is a smart decision from IO to target those 2 in particular because they have wise governments that are working hard for the future of their people, which is not yet the case for Sudan despite the recent revolution. Yet Sudan is an undiscovered gold mine,  it is endowed with considerable and widely diversified natural resources , most significant of which is agricultural and agro-pastural lands , rainfall ranging between 200-2000 mms ( north to south ), the River Nile and its tributaries carrying an annual average of 85 milliard cubic meters  , in addition to over 130 livestock units (cattle , sheep, goats and camels ). Sudan is also very rich of natural resources , including but not limited to , petroleum , iron ore , copper , chrome ore , zinc , mica , silver and gold.
The below TED talk from Charles Hoskinon was a major source of inspiration for this idea. Ironically he mentions Sudan in particular as an example of unbanked and undocumented African countries

I have been noticing a trend here in Africa for the past year that drew my attention to a serious problem.
The inflation rate in the country where I live (Nigeria) for example is about 12% - 15% a year, Nigeria which is one of Africa's largest economies suffers from a rapidly depleting currency, so are the other countries on the continent, even at a larger rate.
This dramatically affects each individual, and undercut their power in the global economy,
Making their life long savings, which they have worked very hard for, useless by the day.
Take West Africa for example, in Nigeria millions of people have to save a great percentage of their earnings monthly, to be able to carter for their future.
the most popular digital savings platform in Nigeria (PiggyVest) for example, records over 2 million savings monthly on its platform, with over 60% of the users being female (which is pretty great),
The downside is, they don't have the choice to choose what assets they would like to keep their savings in except in the local currency, and this slowly erodes the value of the money over time, to the point where it basically becomes worthless.

Below are 3 scenarios :
Scenario 1 :
late 2020 there was a peaceful protest In Nigeria that later became violent (https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/25/africa/nigeria-end-sars-protests-analysis-intl/index.html).Protesters started crowdfunding to support injured protesters since the Nigerian Medical system is trash or non-existent.The Federal government did not like it and shutdown(https://techcabal.com/2020/10/13/endsars-flutterwave-crowdfunding-links-shut-down/) every fund as best as they can and control with Edward Barneys style tactics.protesters had to resort to using crypto addresses and then the fraud jumped in.This wouldn't had happened if there was a a blockchain contract based medium to crowdfund(Also note the challenges of changing various fiat currencies since the donations came from all over the world).
Scenario 2 : Some months back i had a chat with Gary Tan (Yep , the Tesla Garry ) about investing on a project i was working on but we had a challenge as Garry's Portfolio covers only US Based Companies while i am pro-African Ownership so we were at a standstill , so sadly i got no funding.
This got me thinking about millions of great projects that probably died just because its birth was in Africa (Not saying there are no great projects but they are mostly outliners than norm.).I also intend to incorporate a decentralised investing with also the same or almost better security than the traditional regional based investments.I have been researching this for a while and the reason i found cardano as the version i built for Ethereum was problematic due to the lack of multi-asset support , gas fees etc.
Scenario 3 :
In Nigeria and probably Africa, we are blessed with a-lot of bad leadership.Sadly running for offices is not cheap and most individuals are poor, adding this feature to the project will as-well hell in a proper standard way to fund such huge capital projects .
I can go on and on but i have to cut it short here , there numerous use cases and it will be tweaked as we look at these issues together .
 
The Envisioned state:
An open platform where individuals can anonymously crowdfund a project for equity or without the expectation of equity.
A poor boy from South America or Africa can have a meaningful idea and gets to be funded anonymously and also governed through the holding stocks stacked during investment or funding.
That platform i have been researching on is called Talent Stock.

CONTRIBUTION TOKEN ENGAGEMENT MODEL
The main problem we seek to solve:
Open-source projects need a scalable way to recognize, reward & bolster reputation of committed contributors & incentivize quality decision-making.
The proposed solution we will implement:
Develop a contribution token. This is a staged approach to tokenomics that will start simply and progress to intermediate and eventually become a full complex governance token incentive method.
BACKGROUND
NFT-DAO is emerging from the Project Catalyst community as a collective of 300+ like-minded individuals looking to pool resources and develop an NFT framework on Cardano. Since forming, NFT-DAO has merged or collaborated with 18 Catalyst proposers from Funds 2-5. NFT-DAO is an emergent organisation that is constantly iterating and learning how to work with new and diverse individuals, and considering a range of different viewpoints and ideas. We have looked to Cardano and Project Catalyst as an inspiration for what a collaborative community is and can become. We are also aware of the challenges Project Catalyst faces as it grows in scale and reach, including the challenges of maintaining standards of quality in such a fast-growing environment. Our goal is not only to watch and learn from these challenges, but to align any solutions that may arise between our organisations, and that may apply to other current or prospective DAO's forming in the space.
In our commitment to develop a collaborative economy dedicated to NFT's, we registered NFT-DAO as a DAO-LLC under Wyoming law in March 2021.
This is a Proposal by:
NFT-DAO, a Project Catalyst Fund3 Recipient for a Comprehensive NFT Framework Collab to build a penultimate composable NFT Framework on Cardano. NFT-DAO is a community of 300+ members composed of Developer, UX/UI, Governance, Creative and Marketing holons (working groups). Our motto: 'We work better together'.
NFT-DAO Fund3 Proposal: https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Comprehensive-NFT-Framework-Collab/334521-48088
We have also been very humbled by the vote of support by the Catalyst community in receiving a Fund3 budget allocation. Our holon-teams are busy working toward our major milestones, including delivering a composable marketplace for the community to build on.
CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES
Although we are not near the scale of Project Catalyst, NFT-DAO does have a community of 300+ members, each with varying degrees of engagement and activity within the DAO. Some of the early challenges we have found in building a collaborative community has been:

1--how we communicate and make decisions within a large community?
2--how we balance people's right to open discussion (to have a voice and be heard) with finding closure and initiating action?
3--how to onboard newcomers who may feel overwhelmed by a proliferation of information?
4--how to implement fair and equitable consensus mechanisms in relation to varying degrees of community input and investment?
5--how to navigate centralised leadership with distributed ideals?
6--how to manage dissent, disillusionment or conflicts of interest/ideals?
7--how to reward contributions for members who are volunteering their time?
It is apparent that some of the challenges we have experienced in establishing an emerging DAO align with Fund 5's Distributed Decision-Making challenge.
PROPOSED SOLUTION
As our goal from the start has been to transition toward a decentralised, self-governing and self-organising DAO – as patterned after Cardano – with members being rewarded in proportion to their contributions. Rewards can be distributed in the form of token utilities for contributions made or governance voting/decision-making. The NFT-DAO has been working on a multi-tiered tokenomics model that can be templated and applied within Project Catalyst, and other DAO's who see fit to use it. The principal tiers of the tokenomics model are:


1--A Project Roadmap;
2--Business Development Stages;
3--Business Milestones;
4--Token Sale Rounds;
5--Token Circulation, with percentage splits;
6--A Token Utility Development Cycle: a) Contribution Token, b) Governance Voting Token, c) Pro-bono Token, d) Kudos Token, e) Retail Investment Token;
7--Contribution Metrics captured per Token Development Cycle;
8--Decentralisation;
9--Metrics of member engagement levels;
10--Onboarding Incentives.
A staged approach to tokenomics (that progresses from simple, through intermediate to complex token templates) will enable delivery of tokens in the near, intermediate and long term. Our process for tracking tokens in the near-term will adapt existing solutions such as the Cardano Registry GitHub to capture contributions. Further research and development will be required to explore cross-DAO auditing options, as metric capture will also need to take quantitative and qualitative contributions into account.
Note: A quantitative contribution is objective, material, untrusted, trackable, accountable (something that can be automated in principle). A qualitative contribution is subjective, involves trust, differences, ranges, balances (something that requires human intervention or representation in the form of voting etc.). A quantitative contribution can always be extracted from data.
How do we encourage people to participate in decision making?
Within this tokenomics model, the high-level goal is to eventually develop a machine-assisted collaborative economy, with automation of voting and engagement mechanisms and tokenised rewards. As this is a more advanced stage of development, this proposal aims to implement a holistic tokenomics framework to incentivise Tier 1 level contributions from community members. This means that a Cardano DAO (C-DAO) native token will be minted for the purposes of distributing to Catalyst community members (and other C-DAO's). The distribution of these tokens will be in accordance with contribution metrics, which will also be determined by member engagement levels within Catalyst (and other C-DAO's). Participation will be incentivised through gamification, that allows members to unlock higher tiers and token utility/rewards as they progress through the member pathway.
How do we ensure the group of decision makers is diverse and accessible to newcomers?
Admittedly, this is a meritocratic tokenomic model. We have found from experience that, despite our best intentions at inclusivity, the core actors and decision-makers in the community are comprised of a 'coalition of the willing'. Therefore, a tiered membership pathway will be better able to attract diversity and newcomers by incentivising their contributions, and providing more opportunities for reward as they contribute more.
How can we ensure that the Catalyst process keeps iterating to improve?
The NFT-DAO are developing ways to improve member engagement and rewards via a native NFT-DAO token. Catalyst uses proposals as a means to provide solutions to problems posed by the Catalyst team and the community. One of the tiers within the member pathway is to unlock Bounty Access. The work we are doing in NFT-DAO can also be leveraged across Catalyst if the community agrees with the approach. One approach is, at a certain tier of engagement, the Catalyst team and community can place Bounties for initiatives, solutions or jobs that need to be done in the community (to iterate or improve on an existing idea), and that contributors will be rewarded in C-DAO, ADA or a Pro-Bono native token. Bounties can then be signed off by Community QA's, who also receive a Pro-Bono token for their service. This is our initial idea and can be influenced by collaboration as we move forward.
How will we include the community in decision making?
One of the utilities to be unlocked is governance. This not only means voting for proposals, but for anything. This can potentially work on two fronts:
1--Lower Member Engagement: Contribution tokens can provide a nominal contribution token payment for a lower tier of member engagement in the community, such as voting on a poll. Polls can support a casual form of decision-forming, that can be incentivised;
2--Higher Member Engagement: Governance tokens can provide members with a weighted vote on more pressing community issues, such as voting on a policy. These higher tier utilities require a consistent degree of engagement within the community to be earned (not just the amount of ADA held) so that members with less ADA can build merit and make equitable contributions toward more impactful outcomes.
A solution may arise in the form of a more robust voting dApp (or enhancement of the current one) so that polls can be made available (for Level 1 Contribution Token holders) or governance votes (for higher-level Governance Token holders). A linked wallet can allow members to receive nominal payments for contributions.

DEFINED SUCCESS REPORTING
3-month: Post funding much of this work will be available to see first hand and can be followed in the Github repository.
6-month: Active usage of contribution tokens in NFT-DAO.
12-month: Launch ready governance tokens in NFT-DAO and the stretch goal of Catalyst actually adopting our model for use with the wider community as suggested herein.
CONCLUSION
NFT-DAO is an emerging, self-organising community that is patterned after Cardano and Project Catalyst. Having experienced the challenges of building a collaborative community from scratch, we are positioned to support Project Catalyst using a native token model to reward community members for their voluntary contributions. Beginning with the pre-alpha minting of contribution tokens, this project will have potential to stage out into a larger project that supports multiple tiered token utilities and member pathways that incentivise community engagement and higher quality decision-making. In the spirit of collaboration, we aim to do this by working with the Project Catalyst team and community, the QA-DAO (for quality assurance and open-sourcing standards), the Council of Catalyst DAO's; and by testing and trouble-shooting within the NFT-DAO itself.

SIMPLY ADD DRAFT PERMISSIONS TO THE CO-PROPOSERS AND THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED!
Currently our team builds proposals together. Catalyst wants to encourage collaboration on proposals that are similar. If you didn't start the proposal, even though you are a co-proposer, you can't work on them in a draft mode.
The originator has to PUBLISH the incomplete version, which opens it up to public comments from outsiders, when we aren't ready for their input or even finished writing the proposal.

Nothing prevents organisations or individuals to create as many digital accounts, as many credentials, as many user profiles they want.
By this mean, what's the value of a digital vote if someone or some organisation can vote as many times as needed to achieve willings that goes against the interests of a community.
In real life, individuals have a voting right after a process of authentication, which consist in checking claims that prove a voter is a unique person. Claims can be very diverses. Like a birth certificate, a familiy booklet, an id card, a driving license, a DNA sequences (!), you name it. All these claims are managed in a centralized maner, by civil institutions, depending on governments or states.
The challenge would be to develop a protocol or some smart contracts, based on game theory, that would allow a network of unique participants to suppress undue participant inside that network. Incentivisation process for participants to act like so is yet to decide.

As Dor discussed in the last town hall, Catalyst is building a community where contributing actors are being recognised through reputation building that will help when it comes to trusting opinions as we scale. I added the following to a town hall a few weeks ago, but unfortunately it was a week when questions were not being answered.
 
Essentially proposers are being excluded from being able to build a reputation by being prohibited from being community advisors. Proposers want to add value to the entire Cardano ecosystem, not just Catalyst. We shouldn't however have to pick one over the other.
 
Therefore please make it possible for proposers to be community advisors in challenges for which they don't have a proposal and therefore a conflict of interest. If this is a limitation of the IdeaScale platform, then please have this addressed as a priority by the IdeaScale development team.

I have been part of Catalyst from the start (I participated in Fund0) and my experience finding information is probably still no better than those just joining now who are reporting difficulty finding out how to participate. This doesn't seem to be a difficult challenge to address if we are prepared to accept that some centralisation (yes that dirty word that everyone in crypto hates) is required for a while.
I would therefore like to make the following suggestions.
1. Central Starting Page - This seemed like a logical first artefact for project Catalyst to implement to be able to effectively communicate with the community. While there are lots of links to documents, chat channels and other resources discussed in the town halls, they are not easy to access or remember. A central page with an easy to remember URL would allow links to resources to be built out over time. As the community has already picked up the initiative for this with https://project-catalyst.github.io/, can I suggest that this site be hosted at https://catalyst.cardano.org? This URL is easy to remember and advertise and using cardano.org means it is clear that it isn't owned by any one actor (i.e. it is a community managed resource). This URL should be advertised at the start of every town hall with big letters saying START HERE, so that new people know where to go. They should be reminded at the start not to ask questions about how to get involved, until they have consumed as much information from this site as possible.
2. DRY - This acronym is used in development to mean Don't Repeat Yourself. I have noticed that in many of the town halls Dor often repeats much of the information already provided in previous town halls. This is not an effective use of town hall time. I appreciate that this is intended for newcomers, however this approach for helping newcomers is not sustainable. I would therefore suggest that instructions provided in town halls be clipped into dedicated videos that can be linked to on the above starting page. If the instructions need to change then they could be covered in a new town hall with the linked instruction video being updated. Short video clips are easier for people to consume, especially if they are only interested in a specific topic.

When not having prior knowledge of people, blockchain is a perfect medium of creating trust, but when it comes to voting in the right projects, and make informed decisions, not all comments/people are created equal. When creating a house, a construction worker should have more say than a pilot, but when deciding how to fly, the pilot should have more say - maybe not more say, but should be listened too in a more impactful manner.
I see a future where people's believe-ability in different areas are public, and scored in an open sourced manner.
The score should be based by open sourced criteria's, and results oriented in proportion to stated goal, eg. This app should secure everyone with an ID. The most believable persons would then be on the team which created the go to app, which has more users.

Final customers buy rain forest wood blindly. They don't buy wood and instead turn to polymer solutions to avoid participating in deforestation. An ADA token of traceability and governance could help authenticate the wood chain of custody from the forest to the factory to the final buyer log by log and make the chain of custody forgery-proof. This gives small and medium scale factories the possibility to enter the supply chain usually reserved to huge companies backed by third parties and governments. An ''ADA teak log token'' for example could identify each teak log one by one and attach an ID to the log so the business is made log by log and not plank by plank as conveniently managed now.

I'm imagining a person who has a great idea that would be perfect for project catalyst and who is naive to the crypto industry and shopping around for the right platform to build it on and maybe the means to get it funded. Cardano's the right platform, but Cardano hasn't made that leap yet to be the obvious choice for many of the future innovators looking for a home because there's so much loud fluff out there.
 
Crypto media is pretty awful- it will never be a fair funnel for cardano and will only send people over when the price goes through the moon- and when that time comes, we better have a healthy ecosystem in place that can healthily integrate ambitious, high-reward proposals and grow stronger.
 
So right now, the funnel that's in place for PC is drawing from a pool of folks who've largely been charmed by Cardano due in large part to dumb luck. If a friend hadn't told me to check out Charles, I don't know if I'd have found my way in yet. I would probably just be getting into it now seeing something edge up next to ETH on coinmarketcap…
 
Here's one way that I think we can make the edge of the funnel a little slipperier: a forum. I participated in a couple online workshops that used a platform similar to this one on ideascale. There was a balance of encouraged discussion on forums- open topics and directed questions- as well as encouraged feedback on ""works in progress"" roughly analogous to ""proposals"". I thought that this was successful in building community- sparking relationships between people with e.g. aligned missions.
 
Is the absense of a forum here on cardano.ideascale purposeful? Should we focus all our typing into comments within proposals? Is there already a healthy forum at discord, not something we want to disturb? Because, I personally wish there was a forum right here, one click away.
Back to the funnel- once the funnel leads you here to cardano.ideascale, and you click into the world, you see a bunch of proposals. There is a search filter, but it's not great. There's a search function, that's good. But otherwise you just see a bunch of proposals... And there's a good chance you aren't inspired by things you see on the first page, which might encourage you to take the chance to develop that wacky idea (a good thing) or you'll come away thinking that this isn't the right home for your brilliant wacky idea... yet.
I do think this will all naturally improve, and I appreciate that this is a huge experiment in itself, a huge task for the PC team. But I wonder what initial improvements, like a good forum, could do to make this a really rich ecosystem of ideas and support and comeraderie and common purpose.

Greed and curiosity are strong drivers for many. We constantly hear of gullible people who have been scammed online, especially in the budding crypto economy. Charles himself has expressed frustration regarding scammers:

Cardano could become the de facto digital identity standard, first in the Project Catalyst community, then in the larger crypto space and eventually in the larger society - perhaps one well-known influencer at a time. What if people like Charles could prove their identity across a grand variety of social media and online collaboration platforms so that scamming would become impossible?

Problem
Sites such as Craig's List or Facebook Market Place lack the full trust that smart contracts will provide in the future for a buyer and a seller.
 
Current State Example
If I purchase an Item off of Craig's List from a random person and that person sells me a product which doesn't work. I currently have no system which provides this seller with a rating. I also have no mechanism like a smart contract that will show the seller I'm serious by funding a smart contract before I meet them to let them know I'm a serious buyer. Currently, there is not a good way to create trust for the seller and the buyer.
* Current System - No identity verification
* Current System - You don't need to fund a contract up-front
* Current System - No transaction history or documented mechanism to release payment if purchasers expectations are met
 
Future State Example
By developing a Craig's List/ FB Marketplace Goods Exchange platform using smart contracts , it will now allow a transaction to happen that will allow the seller to efficiently follow-up only on qualified leads, make bidding for items more efficient and allow buyers to have confidence in the sellers rating and validated ID's from users participating in the system.
*Key Benefit for Seller: Only deals with qualified leads because the purchaser will fund a smart contract up front.
*Key Benefit of the Buyer: Only deals with Sellers that have a good seller rating and also will not release the money until the product has been inspected to prohibit fraud.
 
* Future State - Bother users must be verified
* Future State - Contract must be funded before transaction takes place
* Future State - Transaction history is recorded and a mechanism is provided to release payment if expectations are met.

Today the requested $ is deep within the summary of the proposal which requires casual voters on a pc to click on each idea to find it. Some ideas to solve this are: adding the request to the content in the idea's preview, title, or as a tag with requested $ range tags.

Currently it is difficult to look at the list and find ideas that you like using available sorting mechanisms. Tabular formats with groupings of similar ideas would 1) allow faster review, 2) allow users and proposers to quickly identify overlaps and synergy opportunities.
Also, by allowing ""sort by popularity"" in correctly advantages ideas that are submitted earlier in the proposal submission stage as they will tend to receive a higher number of kudos.
Also, a standard way to indicate that a proposal is a continuation of a previously submitted proposal with a link to the previous proposal would be helpful.

It seems quite confusing when first getting started on IdeaScale on what things are or how things work. It would be nice if there was a Get Started section with all the resources you need to inform yourself on what everything is and how it all works on IdeaScale. I was opening up docs from one place, then another, I think it would be a lot better if everything was in one place.
Also, an easier way of looking through other people's posts and proposals, like an improvement on how things are filtered and organized; because it sort of stinks trying to look through every single post to make sure if you are not posting something that was already posted. Maybe having a clear rules or guidelines posted in the proposal sections stating how things work in that challenge discussion area.
Maybe there can be different proposal solution areas, like with this challenge there could of been a section specifically dedicated for the User experience or UI. The challenge seems quite broad, so I guess the main theme of this proposal is to look for ways to better organize IdeaScale and have as many sign posts for Users; so users feel as informed and confident in what they are doing on here as possible.

Any new user to this website will start by clicking around to see wether the material is of interest to him/her and to see wether she/he can contribute to the platform. As of now, only registered users are allowed to view challenges and their proposed ideas. The registration requirement as an extra hurdle to participation is not essential for simple viewing actions and thus only has a negative impact in my humble opinion. In an envisioned state the registration requirement could be reserved only for actions related to contribution to this platform (writing proposals, upvoting ideas etc. )and not for viewing the material.

Let me articulate further. Imagine instead of all these different challenges, there was just one challenge ""What is your proposal to improve the Cardano network?"". And then the community can decide and prioritise what is needed and when. We have the following challenges instead:
How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps? You have already created one with the Plutus playground etc etc. Why does this need to be separated?
How can application developers drive adoption of Cardano in 2021? By building apps... Everyone knows this. I don't understand the point here.
How can we help the Catalyst community to get better at distributed decision making within the next two Catalyst rounds? It would help if you stopped trying to socially engineer things. Let the community come together without all of these barriers.
How can we encourage entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds? They are coming. We have 8000 people registered. We don't need to force anything.
How can we encourage more meaningful participation in Project Catalyst from community members in the next two funds? I mean at this point, this question doesn't even make any sense. What is 'more meaningful' participation?
How can we mobilize the community to solve local problems using Cardano, through a Local Community Center model supported by the CF? What sort of Local problems? We need clarity. You've just sprung this new term of local community center model on everyone without any sort of definition or background. Is this some sort of in person hub that people can go to? Something was mentioned about TedX which was confusing somewhat.

Currently, there is a lack of community, discussion, collaboration, and networking by developers and entrepreneurs on the idea scale website. The comment section for each proposal is valuable and provides a medium for networking and commenting, however it is not sufficient. In my experience exploring the proposals I found that the number of proposals creates a barrier for participants looking to collaborate and network. For example, there are instances of multiple proposals addressing the same problem. The requirement of going to each proposals comment section to discus or inquire about collaboration is not efficient. In addition, the networking, discussion, and collaboration between developers and entrepreneurs ideally should happen before the proposal is submitted. This would result in higher quality proposals and less redundancy.
The envisioned state would contain a discussion/collaboration/networking section on the ideal scale web site. This would enable a community of participants to leverage each other. For example, an entrepreneur with an idea could create a post and have a discussion on potential of their idea. Also, developers could explore this section for potential collaboration opportunities. The sectioning of proposals and ""proposal generation"" would make idea scale a network that can generate ideas and teams, which are then funded in the same network. The emphasis should be placed on creating this community and making a more attractive section for developers and entrepreneurs to collaborate.

Problem:

Currently, the user is presented (at the home page, and search) with an overwhelming amount of complex information that is a struggle to piece together, and it is difficult to figure out where they can contribute and/or what they should do.
The campaign stages are also easily confused with the various funds & projects under 'Active Campaigns' (listed on the right), and it is difficult to figure out the context of the overall project and what is a stage or project or a proposal or a whatever.
There is no intuitive starting point within the overall scope. If they click on share insight, they are able to discern (with some effort) what type of post they can and cannot submit but it is quite onerous and tedious.

Solution:

A timeline of the campaign stages clearly highlighting the current stage should be visible first thing in the home page and search pages, so users can see immediately where to hook into the process and where and how to engage properly, as well as getting a sense of the overall project scope and state.

 

For example, graphics like the campaign timeline and stage flow, etc. (attached) found within the Fund'X' pages (which are somewhat redundant in 3 places within the page, btw) should be 'exposed globally', so to speak; and placed (with some redesign work perhaps) on the home page, search pages, and maybe even within the ""Share Insight/Proposal"" submission forms.

Currently the app only allows a 4 digit numeric PIN. Ideally the app would allow for a longer and more diverse (more characters) password. The app provides a lockout after several attempts however with access to the QR code, you can attempt the password as many times as you like. Based on a rudimentary attempt (human operated, little prior experience with the app, attempting to brute force, clear app storage+cache, attempt again), you could brute force the code in a matter of hours at the very worst. Assuming a capable attacker, you could likely brute force the app in a matter of minutes.
Hypothetical Scenario: Based on how easy it was to lock out and restore the app it should be trivial to operate this app in a VM and automate+duplicate the process. Imagine a handful of android VMs based off a memory snapshot of the app brute forcing a set of pins to divide the work and either reporting back upon success or restoring the VM and attempting another set of pins, rinse repeat. With just 10k combinations, around 3 attempts per lockout, and a generous 1 minute per lockout(assuming full automation of app interaction and restore), it should only take about 3400 VM-minutes to crack when rounding up to the next hundreds.
A VM on AWS capable of running Android only costs 0.0168USD an hour(fractional by the second). With this, it would only cost 0.98USD (for 1000 VMs) and about 3 minutes 30 seconds to crack.
Of course this hypothetical supposes a decently sophisticated attacker however with the scale of AWS, even mild amounts of sophistication can reduce the financial and time cost of an attack like this to almost nothing. This should be considered a cornerstone piece of our decision making infrastructure in the future. It is essential that we minimize the potential for malicious actors to compromise our voting infrastructure.
 
Potential Solutions
Solution to Brute Force: Increase the PIN size(no less than 8 and preferably up to 64 or more) and/or transform it into a standard password to allow for more character diversity.
Solution to Restore bypassing Lockout: Migrate the PIN challenge (for voting itself. don't require a PIN to view or prepare votes) to a on network operation. Pre-fund the challenge Txs with the initial registration fee and deny all Tx after the initial allocated Tx have been consumed. Refund remaining allocated funds after voting has ended.

a token that would motivate people from all over the world to share messages from their surroundings, messages from people to people. Currently, the world is full of fakenews and reports are being edited. 1token = message approx. 1 - 10 minutes long. My idea is something like twitter - in short and up to date.
News token - news from people for people - basic division - continents - states - cities - small towns - villages. Motivation to obtain a token = value = usability = interest in messages according to preferences. For a message 1 token, people will send messages from different angles. The token would not be transferred to the account until at least two messages arrive at the same event - this would confirm and prevent fraud.

At the moment every country or state has there own databases. There is no central worldwide database. I believed that it´s mainly because of safety and privacy issues that can be overcome using decentralized Cardano blockchain.
Travelling with pets can be a nightmare. You need a physical passport, with rabies vaccines or blood tests up to date (depends on the country), and there is not a piece of single health information in both microchip, database or passport. Being a Veterinarian I have realized the many issues related with travelling and recording health information, to be used by any Vet, in case your pet has a health problem in a different place (city or country) rather than your own clinic. Also, I have seen forged passports with false information that allow puppies to travel underage.
Nowadays, Vets lose a ton of time just writing (both physically and digitally) the medical information and all the vaccines. Imagine having 20 vaccines in one day. You have to physically remove the stamp of each one and put it in the passport and then, register the mandatory ones (usually rabies) in a digital platform and all in your own clinical software. Even if that only takes 10 minutes per client, by the end of the day you´ll spend more than 3 hours doing paperwork and not providing real veterinary care to the patients. And that time is useless for clients because when they move abroad, loose their physical passport or travel, they don´t have and own their full clinical information.
My ultimate vision is to have a platform that connects with the pet´s microchip and allows Vets, Travelling inspectors, and other institutions like shelters, etc., to have full (translated, if needed) clinical information (allergies, vaccines, surgeries, chronic or infectious diseases) and that can be used to upload new information with bar codes or any other method that can speed up all the processes. I imagine scanning the pet for the microchip, grabbing vaccine and pass it thought a bar or QR code, and automatically upload to the patient file, history and digital passport.
Keep in mind that the pandemic just made public health and preventing zoonosis (diseases that are transmitted by animals to humans), a top priority. Animals can travel and infect with many diseases and it´s crucial that we have a safe and decentralized platform to keep the thing running smoothly and that can allow traceability in case of an outburst. Also, with new species being introduced has house pets, those risks increase significantly. This can also, be used in production animals. However, they already have much better systems implemented than house pets.

Definition:
Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and centralized government power maintained by political repression and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses political parties and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.
This means that Authoritarianism is the exact opposite of Decentralization.
Then the question is:
How to protect a Decentralized system against an external threat actively trying to damage it?
Let's ask some more questions:
Why the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) banned Bitcoin but most of the mining is done in China?
Will a 51% attack on Bitcoin happen one day?
Is it true that the UN and the WHO are influenced by the CCP?
Is it true that the CCP influenced federal and local elections in South Korea, Canada, Australia and others?
What the world will look like in ten years with a techno authoritarian regime as the first economy?
Why the US and European countries didn't ban Bitcoin when they could?
Is it because maybe they realized that Iranian, North Korean and Venezuelan governments were interested on using Bitcoin and crypto as a trading mechanism?
Will Russia mine Bitcoin in Siberia?
How the highest elites of the world will try to keep power?
Will these aspects clash with decentralization?
If so, what to do?
 
If Decentralization will be a trend in the upcoming years then also Authoritarianism.
 
If one day Catalyst becomes an outstanding example of decentralized democracy, could it be a possibility that authoritarian regimes feel threaten by this achievement?
How would they react?
At some point, could the Treasury become an attractive pool of value to be funneled?
How easily is to make a democracy system such as Catalyst to fail?
What are the systems, tools or principles that protect Catalyst from authoritarian regimes trying to corrupt, mislead or undermine democracy systems?

In here, there are very smart people with the best of intentions, however once Cardano gets mass adoption it will inevitably attract bad actors to the proposals and voting system.
What are the tools, systems or principles in place to avoid corruption within Catalyst?
If there are already some, then is important to share this info through the Catalyst channels.
A good example of a crack in the system is the Referral Rewards - 500 ADA is given to someone if a the winner in a fund was initially referred by a previous Cardano / Catalyst user. This reward requires trust and the worst part is that not only is corruptible but it actively attracts corruption because it has two of the common aspects of a corruption dynamic which are: hard to get, easy to cheat AND not verifiable, not punishable.
Several times 500 ADA reward lost mean that other projects would not get funded.
Not only that, after the damage is done:
Corruption works exponentially, if there are no defenses and the same mistakes are made bad actors attract more bad actors AND bad actors already abusing the system confidently exploit the breach more intensively.
Then,
Continuous or neglected corruption leads to:
Down spiral - a corruptible environment gains a reputation where bad actors can thrive
And then:
Solidification - a cultural development and appropriation that expands to other forms of culture (e.g. An individual could tell to himself ""I belong here and this is what I do and it doesn't matter much because lots of others do it as well"")
Worst case scenario:
Downturn - Being dishonest becomes generally more profitable giving clear disadvantages to those that follows the rules of the game. When this dynamic is mixed with the ""Law of the jungle"" where the strongest / biggest wins then dishonesty becomes a survival method more than a choice. At this point corruption is sustainable, expands and regenerates itself until resources are exhausted and the system dies or there is a drastic change that make individuals to be forced or inspired to be honest.

Giving kudos to proposal with multiple proposers gives them a kudos each.
So for a proposal with 5 co-proposers giving it a kudos would give the proposal 5 kudos.

To enter this proposal, am I expected to look through the 195 other proposals to make sure some else hasn't entered mine or similar? Some folks won't bother, others would just enter a duplicate. A community manager or other should be culling duplicate projects. There should be sub-categories so you can bin proposals by topic and sub-category. Give users control or assign someone to perform these tasks. For example, I may know I wish to fund 2 financial dapps in Round 3, but search facilities insufficient to even start that query (Popular, etc, insufficient). There should be a limit on the number of proposals that make each stage. The less organization, the lower that limit should be. If we get to voting with 100s of options, how meaningful is that vote? Voting mechanics also need a lot of work - only on Deadalus? What about users of other wallets. If you have 100,000 ADA, is it worth risking $30K to move it from one wallet to another to vote. Some folks don't want full node wallets. I know these are problems likely not easily or quickly solved, but PC state right now is very difficult and much too time consuming to work with long term. I am motivated, care about Cardano's future, and it is way too much of a burden for me.

This isn't a criticism, more like a raw assessment of what Catalyst does and what it does not. I have long been familiar with IOHK / Cardano but only took some really serious deep dive (metadata and other key functionalities) during the October 2020 WyoHackaton where our little team of 2 (Len Delunas creator of the FundTrack idea, and myself helping my old friend, business colleague, crypto peer, and Cardano early adopter Len) won 3rd place. That's when I joined Project Catalyst every week, so I'm still relatively a newbie there.
I've looked at some of the projects, and found that we never emphasize enough the fact that the most substantive projects should have some serious road map to spread adoption of the Cardano ecosystem among developers, which is one major key objective for all Catalyst successive stages, if I understood correctly. From what I've seen of Catalyst with Dor every week since October 2020, the goal there is to build a community under a ""collective intelligence"" mechanism design, using a process of curating, evaluating, selecting projects and deciding their adequate level of financing.
From what I observed from the data more recently, those well embedded with already a strong brand value and recognized track-record inside the community (street creds as we like to say), do better. And those who slice their project idea into smaller components gradually offering these with ""low-ball"" figures (numbers) also do better. So while I believe that several hundred thousand USD figure (number) is a realistic SaaS product start-up stage level of ""angel"" financing, this may not be the level of commitment where votes are willing to go at this particular stage of Catalyst.
So in case projects realistically evaluated at several hundred k$ do not get voted, perhaps there is a plan B to propose a component of the project with a lower-ball number and build up from there, however that doesn't start to tackle the complexity and cost and duration over time of a real industrial size project. But then again I'm still a newbie in the Catalyst system, so my understanding may not be reliable. But that maybe would be my own navigation map should I submit something in future: gradual steps inside the Catalyst collective intelligence system.
But then again the immediate corollary to this is, what is representativity, what is a vote besides token-based staking, whose vote is it? There is a serious difference when you have real skin in the game, when you are experienced. When you have the kind of interpersonal maturity of social and professional judgement, and are able to appreciate and evaluate the full development, financing, and implementation trajectory of a project. Vs when you are a genuine and a good faith contributor but in fact have very little skin in the game and even less experience in socio-professional access, in substance, and in time, then again perhaps a relative notion, but still.
Because skin in the game, experience, maturity of judgement, those have a tendency to fly as a squadron, and that's called being qualified (a seasoned professional, a qualified investor, a senior decision maker, etc), and being qualified is an important factor in the process of collective intelligence. As the other component besides diversity of background and perspectives. And qualification and diversity both feed each other, one can't exist productively without the other. However if that devolves into a sycophantic arrangement of technocratic expertise, that's where governance fails, and we see that a lot these days around us when confronted with planetary scale events and crises.

Low income earners do not have the resources to put down a ""worth while"" investment into crypto currency, often living on a week to week basis. By either partnering with a pre-existing bill paying application or introducing a debit card that could be used with either FIAT money/ADA. Within either form of paying for everyday items/paying bills, if you rounded up to the nearest dollar and allocated that money to a weekly fund that gets converted to ADA the low income earners will slowly adopt into cryptocurrency at a slow rate.
 
If you had 10 transactions a week for example $8.15 and the amount was rounded up to $9 that will give the card holder a $8.50 purchase of ADA by the end of the week. Just under $450 by the end of a calendar year which in a perfect world with ADA gaining value from a mass adoption will incentivise using ADA for daily purchases or converting more FIAT into ADA.

The current Catalyst voting process is very tedious, restricted and difficult for new participants.
For example, although the voting registration window for Fund 2 is completed, and we are already starting Fund 3, the current Daedalus Catalyst wallet and Catalyst app only allows for registration for Fund 2.
There is no way to register and prepare for the Fund 3 voting, nor any link or reference on either apps, or how the process workflow is supposed to work.
Neither are there instructions or an overview of the approach to voting if a user wants to read the details.
Similarly, even if you want to learn more about Fund 2, the ideas, proposals and information, it is extremely difficult on Idea Scale to look up and explore where the Fund 2 round is up to.
There are many alternative approaches that would lower the barriers to entry, encourage more community participation, but also help ADA stake holders to engage and prepare for the upcoming rounds of voting.

Currently the best source of information to make a voting decision is whatever is provided by the Catalyst Voting mobile app. The information provided in the app by each proposer goes through multiple rounds of revision by community advisors, which provides some rigor. But, ultimately there will be proposals on decisions that will require knowledge that is outside the scope of an individuals knowledge or abilities.
The currently proposed remedy is to all an individual to delegate their vote to an ""expert"" through a system of, ""liquid democracy"". However, the problem still stands...an individual may reason through the process along this line of reasoning, ""I'm not informed enough to cast my own vote, how do I know how to delegate it to?"" Whom is this individual to trust when making a decision about delegating their vote? Information provided by the ""expert""? Is the expert trustworthy? The expert wants to win votes. The expert has incentive to say whatever is necessary to gain votes, be it truth or not.
A decentralized source of information that can be moderated and validated by the community, powered by the blockchain itself, would provide a trusted repository for individuals to reference. The source of information would bring concepts as complicated as network parameters and consensus mechanisms to the widest audience possible by breaking them down into relatable, manageable chunks of information. These explanations could be created by experts and teachers, validated by other experts, all of whom could be incentivized through a monetary rewards scheme, or a reputation system, for providing high quality and truthful information.

Today, it's too complicated and demanding for average users to install and use the native Cardano gear (Daedalus and Yoroi) on their devices. While other popular wallets do not support ADA, the Cardano native wallets do not support other tokens. For most people, this situation creates additional difficulties and is a hindrance to adoption.
As a customer I would like to pay everything with ADA. As a merchant I would like to accept ADA from everybody directly peer to peer without any intermediaries.

Choco, a solution for monetising online content.
The current options for content monetisation are, either centralised systems like Youtube or blockchain-based alternatives like MINDS, Odysee/LBRY etc. The problem of censorship resistance with centralised systems is well understood by most. Blockchain-based systems like MINDS or Odysee/LBRY address this problem but only for content hosted on their respective blockchains and platforms.
I am herewith submitting an idea on how to give creators the freedom to publish and monetise their content anywhere online, with minimal setup.
Let's say you have a blog that you want to monetise. Ideally, you want to have a ""widget"" for tipping that any user can press to send you some ADA (fixed or custom amount).
The way I am thinking this would work is:
A - There needs to be some sort of ""back-end"" server that receives the tip requests and broadcasts them to the blockchain. Ideally, the back-end server can be a wallet (Yoroi) on your client device (the sender). The tip requests are encoded as JSON-RPC.
B - The widget also supports an optional callback mechanism to send transaction data to the blog service provider.
C - We could also imagine a scenario where we have an interface between the widget and the wallet, a ""mid-layer"". The idea is, we may not always want to forward the tip requests directly to the wallet but through the mid-layer. The mid-layer would implement a set of business rules to help protect the wallet from abuse and have some reporting features.
To summarise, you have:

The presentation layer: A tip widget
The Business layer:
2.a) A controller, implemented by the blog service provider to handle the callback requests
2.b) The mid-layer
The persistence layer: The wallet
The data layer: the blockchain.

This should be implemented with customisation in mind. E.g. one should be able to customise the look and feel of the widget, also the data layer (Cardano for now, later, any other compatible blockchain) and/or currency (ADA or, later, any ADA ERC-720 token) for tipping. Additionally, anyone should be able to implement additional custom business rules on the mid-layer. Etc.

Currently there is no purpose built indicator that highlights multi-staged proposals that require multiple rounds of funding.
When voters read a multi-staged proposal they'll easily grasp the grand vision of the proposal but can easily miss that the grand vision isn't deliverable within a specific fund but rather just the first stage, one of many, is deliverable.
There can be quite a bit of detail and complexity in proposals leaving voters to quickly skim through the grand vision, look at the funding required and then quickly assess, incorrectly, based on these 2 details alone. Stages can also be disguised in heavy detail to obfuscate to the voter what is actually being delivered for the funds requested.
There needs to be clearer opacity to highlight multi-staged proposals and what is going to be delivered for a specific fund.
This could be as simple as a checkbox that highlights multi-staged proposals, which can then be used on presentation layers, as well as a new field that indicates what stage the proposal represents as well as what specifics are going to be delivered.

Blockchain becomes successful when it is used in ways that are impossible to do with fiat. ADA becomes dominant if it can do things no other blockchain can do. This proposal leverages ADA's stakepools and the incoming ability for holders to delegate their funds to multiple pools to provide charitable funding in a way not possible anywhere else.
Charitable funding has three major friction points to funding, tight pockets, government impositions, and the need for continual, reliable funding rather than funding in fits and starts. Lots of energy is spent dealing with these issues, rather than publicizing what is needed for a basic revenue stream.
Charitable giving also has some serious impositions. The first is a general desire to keep earned funds in our pockets, the second is dealing with government requirements about giving and reporting, and the third is a general lack of transparency.
The ADA garden alleviates all these friction points while enhancing the funding of charitable endeavors and decentralizing the blockchain.
In The ADA Garden, giving and receiving are made as easy as possible. The first barrier, tight pockets, is alleviated by not requiring anyone to actually reduce their balance to give to a charitable effort. It's far easier to donate a small fraction of your earning potential by delegating some of your stake than it is to dig around in your wallets, enter passwords, find addresses and send some amount when you happen to remember. All anyone has to do is delegate part of their funds to the charities they are interested in. Charities simply have to use this platform to set up those pools and describe their needs.
Government intervention is alleviated because donors do not actually send any funds anywhere, thus no reporting must be done regarding donations. The negative side effect of this is that tax write-offs will not be possible. However, this can be alleviated by also providing a one-stop place for ADA related charities. If people want to donate out of their funds directly, this will be possible too.
Transparency is what leads to trust and historically this is where charities often fail. Government enforced reporting leads to embellishments and vagaries regarding how funds are spent. With blockchain, every ADA can be tracked. Part of the charity profile will be describing how funds are spent, with addresses of vendors who will be accepting ADA as well as exchanges used to convert to fiat as needed, with time, the idea will be to reduce reliance on an exchange by having an ADA economy amongst the charity and its vendors and recipients. Our website will provide basic graphics describing the flow of funds.
Summary
Donating income potential is something that can only be done with a PoS blockchain. ADA is the only blockchain that can do this because the pools have extremely low funding thresholds required to start one, and will have the ability for people to delegate to multiple pools. Thus this idea promotes the use of blockchain and exemplifies one reason why ADA is better than other blockchains. The difference between the current state is summarized as follows

Donate earning potential in a set-it-and-forget-it method rather than acquired funds

 

As funds never leave your wallet, there is no reporting for donors even in the strictest government reporting scenario

 

As funds come by operating a pool, charities have a basic income they can rely upon rather than intermittent fund drives

 

Charities, using the ADA garden do not need strong technical skills as the platform will take care of the technical side of running pools

 

Charities will verify their recipients and vendors, thus every ADA can be accounted for at any time rather than vague reporting methods that are available only when the charity goes through the work of publishing them.

At the moment we only have yoroi app where you can delegate. But the solution and Idea i am bringing to the table is an app that enable almost everything that has to do with financial inclusion take place. I call it Adamoni App or Blockmoni App.
 
THE FUTURE USE CASE FOR CARDANO TECHNOLOGY - HOW TO BECOME
YOUR OWN VIRTUAL CRYPTO MOBILE MONEY & STAKING AGENT
With the App you can perform the following;
1. You can Open a digital Account and send and receive crypto money from your friends
though a mobile phone number, name or BVN, with the aim of becoming your own bank.
2. You can convert ADA to local FIAT and withdraw using an ADAcard or blockmoni
card (optional but will boost cardano). It is one of the challenges we face currently in
Africa. We can be the issuer or reseller in Nigeria.
3. You can use it to pay for goods and services as well as purchase key digital currencies
like bitcoin and litecoin or any currency build on cardano platform.
4. You can easily settle and pay your bills through the ADAmoni app. E.g. Bills like
Electricity bills, POSTPAID bills, TV monthly subscription, DSTV subscription,
shopping online (with discounts) and mobile phone recharges etc.
5. The app can be used in making cash deposit from one bank account to another account
which means we will need partnerships with the banking sector (if need be) to enable this
service function properly (so that the cash gotten can move back into the banking system
since they are not totally eliminated in this exercise)
6. It can also be used as an investment platform through thrift collection.
7. If possible, we can digitalize recharge cards (airtime) to ADA on the APP.
8. It can also be used as a staking medium to enable people stake their ADA for ROI
9. We can also put a feature like stop loss to hedge losses. We hope that companies will
have a stable coin built on top of cardano and we use them as the medium for hedging.
10. Support or help features will not be left out to enable backend team attend to issues.
11. You can also do thrift collection. Where people can give you cash and you convert those cash to ADA against a customer or clients name and can be withdrawable anytime they need their money with interest accrued to the clients.
 
12. The customer can also borrow or lend cash from us while his ADA will serve as collateral.
 
Agents and users will make money using our App. You can call it a money making App where everything financial and payment activities take place.

It should be good to offer something that solves their problems. Some service/s that the Cardano infrastructure is well suited to solve for them, so that Cardano may become a key factor for their success and the base technology for their strategy. That could attract many users and developers to the ecosystem.
One of the main problems os software startups is to make an efficient use of the cloud. Cloud providers offer services like migration and scalability of the client services that are transparent, but are confined in the walls of the Cloud provider. Ouroboros is well suited to give some improvements to the market of cloud services in terms of transparency and fluidity.
Transparence in pricing: One of these improvements is to handle contracts and negotiation with different cloud providers, whose rates are now rather obscure and complex depending on the usage of many different parameters.
Fluidity and standardization: There is one more service that is also very important for distributing, migrating and escalating services: A fast registration and lookup of universal resource identifiers which are not locked in an specific cloud provider could make some central tasks of Cloud services much more open and standard. With this service, companies can migrate and scalate resources without be locked in the walls of a particular cloud provider. Names may collide, so they need a blockchain. At the same time, a change should be updated fast when new servers are added to the pool of the service, in terms of minutes, So DNS is too slow. Ouroboros can do it. That service could allow client programs to locate the address/addresses of the server/s so that a company can migrate and escalate their servers with far more ease, without the need to rely in the services of any particular cloud provider.
Having some library which provides name resolution and payment negotiation with cloud providers using Cardano infrastructure could be a great addition and attract many users and developers to the ecosystem.
 
Moreover, things do not end there. There are two possible strategies that depart from that naming+paying cloud services:
- To create a meta-provider of computer resources or…

The gap between community and professional lobbyists is the same around the world where there is a huge bias in favor of the corporations. Technology can give us greater access to government but it is not being capitalized on by the community because of a lack of collaboration and the gap between government and community is growing bigger.
 
Community lobbying is a cycle of people rising up for an emotive issue, mostly under equipped to properly and professional lobby the government, they are mostly no match for what they are up against. Different groups and individuals lobbying for different issues come and go sometimes wasting mammoth efforts in campaigns that have little or no influence on government or legislation, they lack professionalism, experience and a realistic strategy to have any influence, the gap between community and special interests lobbyists is gargantuan.
Professional lobbyists reap sometimes massive financial rewards, while community lobbyists mostly pay from their own pocket and there are no financial rewards or personal recognition for their work, even when they are lobbying for all of our rights and freedoms.
The solution that I proposed creates an ecosystem that provides community lobbyists with tools that can help them professionally engage with the government and the tools for the broader community to better support them. Through a self sustaining application that incentivizes all stakeholders to get involved including government, this ecosystem can help reduce the gap between professional lobbyists and community lobbyists in their ability to raise money and expand their exposure and influence. This projects implementation also includes the engagement of government in the education and implementation of digital voting, a voting feature to be included in the application. There is also potential for government support or funding because all aspects of the application better serve the community and government.
The Cardano governance and consensus philosophies can be built into the foundations of this projects application with a treasury and consensus mechanisms, its adoption by default has the potential to educate the broader community about the Cardano decentralization philosophy, block chain, crypto currency and digital trust platforms.
A not for profit or fully decentralized application using Cardano philosophy would be the target management layer of this application. This application will be unique to every country and the statistical information from all countries could be collaborated to one website that will potentially create a wealth of information, examples, precedents and tools for everyone in the world to use.
Australia would be a good test case for this application because of our small population and our mandatory voting laws.

The Smart contracts functionality enabled by Plutus and Marlowe will allow developers to replicate the features of existing financial derivatives. While these Smart Contract Derivatives (SCDs) may be similar to the traditional derivatives, their underlying instruments will most likely be ADA or other crypto currencies and tokens.
SCDs with crypto underlyings maybe interesting for speculators and investors but if they can be connected to physical commodities, it would open up the possibility of individuals and small companies to buy DeFI SCDs for hedging purposes.
For example a small farmer would like to lock in the price of a crop of wheat or would like to fix their diesel costs for the year. This could be accomplished by buying a SCD Forward Contract on wheat or diesel.
These kinds of instruments are available already but only to very large companies who have relationships with Investment Banks. To make them available as DeFI SCDs, the Smart Contracts would need access to commodities market data that is trustworthy and reliable.
There are recognised sources of these market data in the traditional financial world. Examples are Reuters, Bloomberg, CME and many recognised and regulated market places.
The key point of this idea is to fund the development of market data gateways that interface with these trusted providers and act as Oracles in Cardano to provide inputs to the DeFI SCDs.
The availability of these data on the Cardano platform would open up an enormous DeFI market and democratise access to finance that is otherwise only available to large and connect companies and individuals.

The current gap allows for a few parties to ""harvest"" kudos throughout the Fund stages and deploy them on one project.
Fund stages approx timeline 8 weeks (~60 days)
4 parties would accumulate ~60 kudos each during a Fund timeline.
4 parties can deploy ~240 kudos on 1 project.
240 Kudos is currently = top 7 proposal (in the IMPACT portion of the ranking algo)
This can result in 4 parties artificially buoying a project to look ""community-supported"" in the eyes of a ranking algo.
This results in introducing skewed ""community support"" into a voting app that voters trust to be representative of a process that has undergone extensive scrutiny.
What we need is a better implementation of ""kudos""
Maybe that comes with limitations? (IE: 4 kudos per account, per project, per fund)
Maybe that comes with conditions? (You must add a comment of at least 100 words as to why you left this Kudos)
Maybe that comes with account verifications? (Your account must have generated 5 comments of atleast 200 words before kudos can be allowed)
 
In essence, we need kudos to have a verifiable contributor and have controls in place to provide fairness.
If it belongs as part of the ranking algo, then it must start from a fundamentally sound architecture.
(People will rely on it as a source-of-truth when voting)

I have received several accidental downvotes on Problem Sensing Submissions that I have made. When I see a downvote, I look to see if the person provided a comment to substantiate the downvote. If there is no comment I reach out to the person and ask if they could comment to allow for me to address the issue they saw. In every case the person was not even aware they had downvoted.
There should be user feedback telling them that they have downvoted, and allow for retraction if desired.
It also seems like any downvote should be accompanied by a comment to articulate how the idea may be altered to remove the problem that resulted in the downvote.

Currently at Fund 2, there is a ""mission"". The mission being to create means to attract entrepreneurs and developers.
However it is allowed that any idea is posted here. Also ideas that are completely irrelevant to the initial mission.
This leads to time and resources being wasted. Even to the point that ideas are presented on The Cardano Effect that have no relevance to the mission at hand. (although possibly with merit but not for this mission)
So perhaps create two different pools.
One is the Wild Idea pool, and the other one is the pool where only ideas relevatn to the task at hand are being posted
Here we might have somebody editing the pools. If the idea posted has no relevance to the Fund it has been posted in, an editor can move it into the Wild Idea pool
Later, when there are many Funds and missions, those ideas will probably find they home they belong.

So ...you might create a section that says ""Valued Ideas"" and present them somewhere
Than inside that section, a clear presentation of Ideas that became Proposals. Perhaps call them ""Promoted Ideas""

Voters/Reviewers following an original idea can easily lose track of it once it's merged; because only one link survives to the merge process.If I'm not wrong, there is no link in the activity UI that shows that it was merged (kudos included) nor any further evidence of it if it's not explicitly presented as part of the idea.
In this scenario, losing track is specially easy if, for example, proposers find a new name to call the new proposal/synergy (ie GimbaLabs :)
In the future we will probably have a huge amount of proposals and therefore, many will merge (maybe more than once?) for a greater good and this tracking could become harder, and at the same time, more valuable to answer ""where the idea came from?"".
I think a simple redirect from the non-existing-anymore proposal to the merged/new-parent could alleviate the problem, since voters/reviewers could always click on the links from their activities and they'd get redirected to the new proposal.

Currently, one can propose any amount of ADA requested.
It is my humble opinion that it would be to a great community benefit if there were an arbitrary ceiling imposed. For example, one proposal can ask for a maximum of 25% of total funds available for that given round.
We eliminate proposals that are too extreme relative to the overall fund size and focus more on manageable proposals instead.
The question would remain - what would be reasonable max ceiling rate per proposal and how would that be determined.
Additionally, it would seem to be a no brainer to me as the first step:

not allowing proposals to overdraft the fund treasury as a whole
aka one couldn't submit proposal that goes beyond 100% of the funds.

…as such extreme proposals defeat the whole purpose right out of the gate.
Let's discuss below why is this a good or bad idea. Curious as I haven't made up my mind just yet.

When reviewing Proposals, I try and think about what it will look like inside the voting app, and how it will engage the voter. The Voting app displays these sections: Title, Problem Statement, Solution, Your Experience, (along with a link to read the proposal here in Ideascale, the Reviewer Ranking Score, and ADA Funding requirements).
As I go through the Proposals I find it very difficult to imagine that anyone voting will be able to make informed decisions based solely on the info found in the Voting App.
If they are required to create a login and then log into Ideascale, I see this as a barrier to voting. Probably a large barrier.
Two outcomes are immediately evident if the barrier to details is not lowered:

lower voter turnout
under-informed voting

I know that others have suggested that more info needs to be revealed in the Voting app. My first thought was that we want to keep the voting app data consumption as low as possible. And as such we don't want the entire Proposal there by default.
Is there any possibility of utilizing the Ideascale API, to allow for ""pulling"" the additional details into the voting app, only when requested by the user.
 
EDIT:
Dor has confirmed that the Voting app UI/UX will not change as we move into voting for Fund2. It will be the same look and feel as we had in Fund1.

Would it make sense to have a notification available that a proposer could push once they have meaningfully updated their proposal to come back and have a look? Again, in larger amounts of proposals - this would be handy.

I get no credit or reward for improving the system. The developers and hired workers get all the credit and monetary reward for producing such a great product, but that product is largely implemented based on ideas from the community.

Just a suggestion to the developers, and maybe it is in the pipeline already. I suggest making it possible to purchase ADA directly from Daedalus, Yoroi, or Yoroi Mobile.
The way I see it, a lot of non-technical people will be put off acquiring any ADA due to the convoluted process required to purchase the tokens.
For myself, here in the Philippines, I need to put Pesos into coins.ph, and then convert that to BTC, which I then have to send to Binance, exchange the BTC to ADA and then send it back to my wallet. Way too much hassle and way too complicated for newcomers. If they could simply download a Cardano wallet and buy some ADA that is immediately ready to delegate to a pool that would be a massive boost to onboarding new users.

If someone could build an extremely encrypted communication interface through SingularityNet or Google, I can start gathering this data and once I have the entirety, I will drop redundant copies to The ICC, FBI, and Interpol.
This is completely legal, as she is an eye witness and I am a private citizen.

Anyone who denies the existence of these abuse rings is blind or a conspirator on some level (whether they know it or not).
The ritual abuse of children as a way to corrupt and control the future population has been in practice at least since Ancient Egypt and has been passed down through these organizations in this order Hebrew Pharisees>Catholicism>Freemasonry.
I'm sure some of you are Masons or Catholics. These are not your everyman engaged in this. These are the inner circles.
Why do Archdiocese all the way to Popes, self proclaimed men of God, protect men that commit the most heinous crime against the human spirit? A crime even despised by convicted murderers.
Why do 32nd degree Freemason take a vow to ""Hide all of their brothers crimes up to murder and treason, and those at their choosing""? What crime does that include?
I am not dispatching conspiracy theory. These articles are about my daughter and Kevin Thompson is a ""Mark Master"" Scottish Ritesman even after she came forward the Prince Hall NOPD SVU Detective tried to throw the case for 2 years until I finally backed him into a corner where he had no choice but to arrest Kevin in what the DA described as an open and shut case. Even the articles downplay his association with my daughter's mother as her fiancé of 6 years and don't display his picture. NOLA.com has been claiming this is due to a software transition for 5 years.

I'm using this as a free text field (not sure if appropriate).
You receive 1 kudo per day which can be used for voting on proposals. I have noticed that I am less inclined to review projects once I have run out of kudos, as I can no longer give a kudo even if I find a project I would like to support. I would propose a different system. Open to suggestions there, but for example users could receive a rather large amount of kudos (say, 10 per day), which they can easily add or withdraw (if they change their mind) from each project. To maintain kudo scarcity, voting could work quadratically. Quadratic voting allows users to communicate strength of preference and should result in a better and more efficient depiction of the community's real preferences (see: https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html).

THE PROBLEM:
The biggest problem today is that a vast amount of questions, and answers to those questions, are being iterated in Telegram, Discord, Facebook, and even in YouTUBE videos, that are not being indexed by Google, Bing and other search engines.
 
Many peculiar and interesting questions are not being trafficked on typical venues such as Reddit or the FAQs of IOHK and so on. Moreover, search queries via popular search engines can lead to a user having to troll through multiple resources to find the best answer to his or her search query.
 
THE SOLUTION:
Curate, nominate and create a repository of the best of those questions and answers on Cardanofaq.com.
Cardano FAQ's intentions is to be a community-driven curated set of best answers to frequently, and, importantly, not-so-frequently, asked questions. Also, and maybe more importantly, it raises the profile of the most authoritative voices and resources for the subject matter queried.
Curation addresses the issue of eliminating the need to troll enormous amounts of data on non-indexed resources like Telegram and Discord or to visit multiple answers to the same question across various social media platforms and web sites that cannot be indexed by the most popular search engines.
Curation also means referencing resources. Although answers to questions may be recreated on CardanoFAQ.com we also always add a list of links to the referenced original resource, with the permissions from the original authors if required, and in the case of original content, any citations.
Nomination is to propose references to resources and persons that are considered to be the most authoritative.
FAQs always include an easy to copy short URL of the answer that can be easily pasted into Telegram, Discord, and other commentary fields on sites such as YouTube and Facebook.

I think many of us recognize and respond to the publicity that Cardano is already getting. One flavor of news that seems to get passed around a lot is breadth of Cardano's developmental progress. But as mentioned by institutional critics, our impact is yet to be recognized in full measure, not only because adoption is not complete, but because our use cases are not traditionally recognized yet. We need to make sure that projects now are intended for long term sustainable growth and are facilitating passive marketing in addition to active measures.
Think of this like SM influencers. The biggest ones do not create social impact on their own; there are many mid-level/low-level contributors that maintain attention in that space by constantly interacting with their own social groups (think Chainlink ""marines""). So how do we not shoot ourselves in the foot with volatile SM? That means increasing the diversity of our outreach. BTC maximalists (proponents of a 11 year old project) constantly reach out to business leaders in loosely/unrelated sectors to build out the extensive discussion by exposition of real world problems and solutions, then intensify the discussion on where the money is coming from and going to. While Cardano does not have the first mover advantage, we do have the ability to learn from what the BTC maxis did in the past and what DeFi proponents are doing in the present.
Envisioned state includes such things as an actual English Wikipedia page (requires accepting wikipedia mods/admin), podcasts with popular public figures, and niche business sector involvement that coincides with Cardano's ability to create industry-specific DSL's.

I noticed https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/status-updates/ is a nice source of news, but it's buried and not frontpage. It occured to me that not only should there be a banner with weekly updates, there should also be a ticker of community activity. Other contributors here have noted that the Kudos ticker is a sort of indicator of what content is being looked at and inviting more discussion. That opportunity does exist on cardano.org, but it may be necessary to make it even more obvious and apparent to the casual inattentive audience by placing it front and center of the domain. This way, word-of-mouth marketing also has a short and simple memetic link, which is easier to spread as a result. If there was a ticker of twitter activity based around this sort of marketing, it may provide a sense of reward for those that are tweeting at any given moment about Cardano and related topics.

Currently when trying to submit a proposal to the Fund2 Challenge via IdeaScale there are character limits on the title and description. Currently their is a typo on the title text field that says you have 50 characters for your title. In reality you are limited to 35. I believe changing the allowed characters to match what the text field says (50) would be a quick and easy fix!
 
Secondly the description text field is limited to 140 characters. I believe this was done in an effort to force people to be concise during this stage of the fund. That being said I think raising this limit to 240 could incur the same benefits but also give people an extra sentence to provide context about their proposal.

The current state as mentioned in an article by Dr Ugoji Egbujo ( 16th May 2020) is unacceptable and corrupt. Please see link below is :-
https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/05/the-oluwole-epidemic-fake-documents-counterfeits-everywhere/amp/
This article shed more light on the growing concerns of forgery, fake and counterfeit drugs in the country. The government is helpless and some corrupt leaders benefit from the it and saboteurs within the government will not want change to happen as they might be exposed. Some government official have been found to forge and use fake documents to achieve office while some refuse to tender what they have knowing is fake.
This has dented the reputations of hardworking Nigerians with good characters as all certificates taken abroad now becomes questionable with no adequate digital record to verify instantly. With international university constantly depending emails, postal or telephone which is delayed replies in months or not functional as a result of unavailability of electricity.
To combat this problem and envision a desired state for Nigeria, I believe a decentralized system that does not depend on government or centralized authority will be a saviour. With over half of the population with a mobile phone, a decentralised application linked to the Cardano Ecosystem will be a positive way forward as every institution, colleges and schools use it.

Why pegging a token with only one existing currency when a new one, better and more diversified mean of exchange can be created? 1 unit of this stable crypto will be backed by 0,1 of each top ten currencies so instead of storing and transacting value with one currency this is done through a token representing the value of a basket with the world strongest ones, i.g. USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, KWD, BHD, KYD, GBP, JOD, OMR.
The wallet for this token has to be super simple for adoption. Let's say we call it ""Universal Fiat Token (UFT)"" in the wallet you'll be able to purchase UFT with fiat and crypto and the transaction fees will have to be paid with ADA which will increment the value of the Cardano protocol.

Firstly, allow me to be the first to say that AI is overhyped. It is overhyped. My introducing AI terminology and potential software competitors is not meant to distract from the core and very human labor we have to mobilize to ensure the basic parts of Cardano are guaranteed to be built, completely in Cardano's vision. However, it would be naive to say that a potential sector of commercial activity does not exist in various AI use cases. Quite a bit of money flows there because like all tech, we end up cutting out human activity where an AI, computer, robot, or pulley will suffice. Does Cardano anticipate market adoption in disjointed but equally groundbreaking areas of tech? I think that in order to approach that goal in the future of competing on usability, it behooves us to explore options now to stage environments where we can procure exploratory development while other interconnected researchers do the same in global open source.

At the moment there is no motivation to use ADA for payments. Especially if it is expected that the price will increase in the future. In this case it is preferable to use FIAT money for shopping and ADA only for staking.
If you can simply buy ADA with your FIAT money in an APP (e.g. Yoroi Mobile) and then pay for your purchases from there and even get cashback (in ADA), then there is a certain motivation.
These payments can be made quickly and the high volatility of crypto currencies is avoided. Thus, no one fears to make a loss and the adaptation of ADA will increase.

Right now, people want a landing page for new participants, and they also want to create analogues of freelancing sites. We could adopt a protocol of coordinating recruiters in one hub (here for now), and delegate outreach and project management to the same recruiters in ""spoke"" sites (Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, Gitcoin etc.) A lot of effort may end up wasted if we devote dev resources to creating analogues of each, rather than focusing on one hub.
 
I envision a simple, yet elegant landing page with a chatroom and all other available resources for newcomers.

The Catalyst Kudos system currently institutes what can be defined as an emergent normative space, a type of disciplinary space for the production of community stereotypes and behaviours. The foundations of something called a 'community' and 'authority' begin with the inception of interpellation and libidinal attachment to a normative order. Instead what the Catalyst Project needs in order to generate a community that has the dynamics of a complex system is an opening that incites the emergence of the outlier, the singularity that goes completely against the grain of previous patterns. This is more in keeping with an idea of a community understood as a complex system.

This provides an opportunity for every entrepreneur or person to be able to pay and be paid easily and simply with ADA or ADA stablecoin without restrictions and without extra costs. Now an entrepreneur must always join a third party that incurs a lot of transaction costs. The entrepreneur also has no freedom in the choice of his minimum amount or other options are not possible.
A simple payment gateway where the amount, quantity, name, product, receipt address can be entered. It then creates a qr code so that the other party can pay easily. All this can easily be used into their shop, posted on their website or on social media and will create freedom and miracles.
The extension can also be expanded with the option for an exchange. So that people on any street corner can exchange their ADA or ADA stablecoin for cash or cashless fiat. For this option you need settings such as: quantity, margin, API feed, final price.

Right now, a lot of great ideas are being introduced as overall goals, but with requirements for further development of codebase. A lot of the suggestions also center on forking preexisting projects, and there is confusion and controversy over what needs to be ported into Haskell. We should have a good idea of what we don't have to reinvent (endpoints in other languages), and which mission-critical aspects must be audited and secure per Haskell. And most importantly, our collective pursuit of development should be focused on the same resources for various projects, so we don't divide ourselves into redundant tasks and waste valuable equity.

The knowledge and absorption of the Cardano network's blockchain technology is still superficial in the world population. With the involvement of schools at their most diverse levels, I think that the reach in society at all levels will be significant. To promote and develop the Cardano Catalyst program, I think it is important to include schools and their students in an award and motivation program. Structure a competition with good prizes in different modalities and levels of complexity. Appoint student ambassadors who will assist in the promotion and knowledge of blockchain technology. Involve the direction, teachers, supervisors and pedagogues in the absorption and dissemination of the blockchain knowledge of the Cradano network and its crypto currency the ADA.

What needs to happen with this money:
- A trusted member of the community (Charles or someone else) needs to audit the recent activities of the Cardano Foundation and recommend leadership changes as necessary
-The Cardano Foundation needs to release a community letter detailing information behind the recent layoffs of Casey, Ben, and others
-The Cardano Foundation needs to be up front with the community concerning layoffs and other important business going forward
-The Cardano Foundation should publish weekly updates to the community (via livestream like Charles or blog post) about the current work being done by the Cardano Foundation and what the state of the work is
The money will be used can go to the person auditing, if there are layoffs in the Cardano Foundation leadership they can receive a little package, etc.

It requieres initial accompanying from articulation of ideas, to foster refinement capabilities of proposers - considering that communication is key on how the information is presented, structure, etc. furthermore it could point direct to advise on including missing competencies or could highlight the importance to review on approach and opt for example to slice proposal into parts if this would be of benefit.
Actual gaps are: communication in general, structure of content, concepts of segment addressed, clear value proposition, partnerships, key resources/activities, etc.; unclarity of scope, lack of implementation roadmaps and metrics. - all what I suppose is part of a high quality proposal - in its relevant extent for each proposal of course.

Diverse community members may lack of complementary skills which would lower proposal rating regarding implementation and with that feasibility and impact. Being the actual process driven by initially 1 person proposals, or a group of experts of the same domain, leads to gaps in the approach design of the proposal itself (stating this from what we see in fund 1). This ""dynamic"" could be anticipated through this mechanic of offering the option to source complementary expert knowledge as part of their proposal itself - previous to proposal submission to anticipate high quality proposals.
People might flourish without mental boundaries even better by giving them the option to incorporate expert knowledge. It is all about empowering those who have an idea to find complementary team members to be able to go forward with the proposal. Tackling here the vulnerability of humanity and contribute to the community culture - aspect that should not be underestimated - coming the most of us from realities/cultures where this is not common. It furthermore will help to adaption of this way of working/proposing - lowering burden for those how may be in doubt or anticipate lack of skill - besides having an interesting proposal that community what's to read about.

Even with insight into prior experience, it is hard to know whether someone will deliver successfully on their proposed plans. (I'm reminded of Malcolm Gladwell's essay, years back, about predicting the success of both teachers and NFL quarterbacks: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/15/most-likely-to-succeed-malcolm-gladwell). With Project Catalyst, it is essential that we have some degree of confidence that a proposal has a chance to be successful, at the very least by delivering a return on its intention. Perhaps some sort of reputation metric can play a role in helping strangers decide if one another are up for a job, but even these metrics will be imperfect, and we must allow for capable newcomers to make great contributions.
Long term, lump sum fund dispersals will raise the stakes of needing to get it right as often as possible, and could lead either to wasted funds or gridlock in decision making. We should create mechanisms for proposers to submit funding plans in which milestones are met that trigger the release of more funds. The good news is that smart contracts and governance will facilitate the creation of these mechanisms.
One way to let the system take care of itself would be to encourage proposers to submit over time to successive funding rounds, but the drawback here would be similar to how politicians are always looking ahead to the next election. By building the right funding structure in advance, we can ensure that creators have maximum time to actually do the work they say they're going to do.

As we move toward a more inclusive Catalyst Program, we will see a large upswing in proposals. It was a daunting task during Fund1 dealing with only 57 ideas.
Ideally there will be a Process by which ideas are ""vetted"" prior to submission. This might be accomplished utilizing the Ideascale system, if proposals go through a PRE-Submission phase, and there are enough Community Advisors to take on the chore of Vetting them.
There will need to be domain experts, who can provide significant feedback and act as the ""gatekeepers"" (terrible term, but accurately addresses the need). These folks will need to be able to understand the impact and needs of the proposals they review prior to submission. This points to a need for some system by which the Advisors are identified as competent in certain domains of expertise.

It would be good to have some form of IP Protections in place. These laws vary between jurisdictions. Because of these variances, a Platform-Centric system to dis-incentivize bad actors seems to be required.
The ideal envisioned state would provide protections for the proposer that are known, provable, and concise in their documentation.

The current state: several proposals have proposed solid ideas related to attracting devs (i.e. dev marketplace, adamakerspace, dev education platform, dev hubs). Want to start by saying these ideas have all been GREAT and exactly what we need x100 of at this stage in my humble opinion. The problem is without a central location for all of these to exists for new Cardano devs the value proposition *in each of these* is diminished and the new dev is left bouncing from site to site as they navigate their specific needs. When you look at the current Gitcoin product lineup and the fact it's become the de facto developer meets entrepreneur Ethereum marketplace (~40k devs registered) it actually makes more sense for all of the Cardano dev/entrepreneur-centric proposals to merge ideas and create a central platform similar to Gitcoin composed of different products. I have attached as photos the Gitcoin lineup of products and a high level overview of the bounty product (I have mentioned this idea on multiple Project Catalyst group calls) which shows how a dev would receive payment for a project bounty posted by a ""Funder"". A similar contract for a dev bounty has been developed in Marlowe by a dev I believe Boone hired. You can see this here: https://youtu.be/sziNhvKEGI8?t=3029. This is one of several products I am proposing we pull into a central location to streamline the entire process for new Cardano devs.
 
Before I hit the future state you may be asking what actually is Gitcoin, here is a nice overview they give to answer the question ""What is Gitcoin?"":
Functionally, the app has several key features:
Smart Contracts -- Where funded issues are stored and indexed.
Brochureware -- Describes the project.
Funded Issue Explorer -- A searchable index of all of the work available in the system.
Funded Issue Submission / Acceptance flow -- Interface between the application and web3.
API - the HTTPS API
Bot - the GitcoinBot
Technically, the system is architected:
Web3 The main source of truth for the system is the Ethereum blockchain. Check out the smart contracts.
Web2 This part of the app is built with Python, Django, Postgres, and a handful of other tools that are common in the web2 ecosystem.
Web 3 Bridge This is the bridge between web3 and the rest of the application. Mostly built in javascript(web3js) and python(web3py).
Brochureware Just a nice little landing page telling folks what the Gitcoin project is.
 
Future state vision: A forked implementation of Gitcoin on Cardano,I refer to this as ""Citcoin"" would serve as the backbone for all things developer + project funder/proposer related. Keeping all of the main Gitcoin products and innovating where it makes sense (i.e. For the developer education component creating a product ""Plutus Academy"" as a training program to bring a new dev up to speed on Plutus development and output them with an intermediate/expert understanding of Plutus. The final assessment could involve them building and deploying a contract on mainnet and in the process mint an NFT certificate certifying them as a Plutus dev. Maybe their is certificate in addition to the NFT that goes to their Atala Prism ID). This is a simple example that touches various aspects of Cardano. from here if we talk about including governance components of Ideascale into Citcoin so that project funders can also play an early role in forming new project ideas before they reach a community vote/quorum. To take this one step further In it's final form Citcoin could completely encompass some form of early project idea governance (potentially even integrating some component of Ideascale for community members who want to be involved with the process of proposing project bounties/funding ideas!).
 
Steps involved to realize future state vision: https://github.com/gitcoinco
1. Hire a Python + JS + front-end dev to rebuild Gitcoin as a Cardano public utility for new developers.
2. We will also need to hire Haskell/Plutus devs capable of rebuilding the entire suite of smart contracts on Cardano rails (the bounty escrow smart contract has already been constructed in Marlowe, thanks to Boone and dev team)
3. Emurgo is currently working on a product that will allow for the web app to be accessible through a Yoroi wallet. This web 2.0 to web 3.0 bridge can *hopefully* be a simple process when they complete development for that integration.
 
Most of the smart contracts used by Gitcoin can be built in Marlowe. We can even dogfeed the bounty process to get devs building more complex Citcoin smart contracts and platform features (especially those related to developer education materials and the gamification process similar to the Gitcoin ""Quests"" product). Releasing an MVP followed by rapid iterations including dogfeeding the bounty feature to build out core product components is key to highlighting the platform's capabilities to new Cardano devs.
Please review this proposal and submit thoughts and ideas. I have a few devs I will begin tapping to gauge interest in this project and their may be even potential to *for a short time* poach a IOHK/Emurgo JS or front end devs to help with some of the UI/UX. Happy to hear any and all feedback :)

Currently there exists no Process Outline which explains the steps required to Submit a Proposal to the Catalyst Project. This Current State does not provide any guidelines for discussions with a potential Proposer, concerning next steps and setting their expectations properly.
A clearly defined process would include information about timelines, resources, and systems used. This should start at How to Submit a Proposal all the way through reporting milestones of the proposal. (My opinion is: This should include reporting beyond the final launch and exit from the Funding process.)
